Mansa Musa had passed through the city two years earlier making his pilgrimage to Mecca with thousands of slaves and soldiers, wives and officials. One hundred camels each carried one hundred pounds of gold. Mansa Musa performed many acts of charity and ‘flooded Cairo with his kindness.’ So much gold spent in the markets of Cairo actually upset the gold market well into the next century. Mali's gold was important all over the world. In the later Medieval period, West Africa may have been producing almost two-thirds of the world's supply of gold! Mali also supplied other trade items—ivory, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, hides, and slaves. No wonder there was talk about the Kingdom of Mali and its riches!

Their efforts to claim African identity, therefore, were rooted more in imagination and reading knowledge than in actual facts. Indeed, some white writers influenced African American conceptions of Africa. Vachel Lindsay is one such case. His poems in the vein of “The Congo” influenced Langston Hughes’s poetic imagination. Hughes’s poems about hearing African drums (“Danse Africaine,” for example) echo Lindsay’s work. African American writers were also not immune to notions of dark Africa that Joseph Conrad popularized in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> (<span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-say-as=\"date\" ssml-label=\"Date\">1902</span>).

In 1769, after sales were finalized and 425 slaves were boarded in hollowed corners of the Liverpool vessel Unity, the commander Richard Norris directed his crew to make preparations to expedite sail toward Jamaica. Prior to their departure, Norris reported, ‘the Slaves made an Insurrection,’ pointing out ‘[it] was soon quelled....’ Archival records leave silent the number of people who rose in rebellion [and] the efforts used in their suppression....

Sailors continually sought to prevent ‘chaining those together who speak the same language.’ Yet these divisive mechanisms often proved futile in thwarting collectivism among boarded captives. Forced to live altered lives as someone else’s property, they formulated beginning ideals of a community grounded upon a shared struggle of oppression. Unfamiliar with their geographical locations far from land out at sea, [enslaved people] adapted to their forced surroundings, routinely drawing upon the terrain of ships to reclaim their own versions of power and freedom.
