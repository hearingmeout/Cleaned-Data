Picture 2 shows the same man and woman sitting on a park bench beside one another. The woman now has the flowers in her hand. The balloon is in a gust of air over the man's shoulder and his lips are pursed. Picture 3 shows the man and woman running toward a large tree in the park where the balloon's string is caught. There is a man in a cap walking his dog in the background. Picture 4 shows the same man lying on a branch of the large tree and handing the balloon down to the woman below him. She is still holding the bouquet of flowers.

prose_type:short_story style:1\"><div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\">國畫大師齊白石</p></div><p class=\"passage_para\">齊白石從小就特別喜歡畫畫，可是因為家裏窮，上不起學，也請不起繪畫老師，於是他每天就用小樹枝在地上練習畫畫，畫一些花鳥，魚蟲和小動物。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">後來，為了謀生，家裏讓齊白石去跟著別人學習木匠手藝。工作之餘，他每天都堅持練習繪畫，並最終成為一代國畫大師。齊白石的一生，經曆豐富，充滿了傳奇。但是，流傳最多的都是跟他的繪畫有關的故事。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齊白石喜歡畫荷花，他自己發明了一種叫做“紅花墨葉”的手法，專門用於畫荷花。他畫的荷花顔色大都是紅色的，而荷葉則多為墨色，而不是現實生活中的綠色。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齊白石從小在農村長大，所以他畫的白菜也很有特色，葉子是翠綠色的，莖也是白亮亮的，看起來很生動。有一位出身於富貴家庭的畫家，一直都想學畫齊白石的白菜。但不管怎麼畫都不像。於是他便去請教齊白石，齊白石笑著說，“你全身上下沒有一點蔬菜的氣息，怎麼能畫得和我一樣呢？”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齊白石最出名的作品是畫蝦。他筆下的每一隻蝦好像都有生命，大到整個軀體、蝦殼，小到蝦尾巴，蝦的觸鬚等等，齊白石都能將他們生動地展現在人們面前。所以有人讚賞說，擁有齊白石的一幅蝦畫，即便不能天天吃蝦，也可以大飽眼福了。可是，齊白石自己卻這樣說過，“我今年七十八歲了，人們都說我只會畫蝦，真冤啊！”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齊白石不但在繪畫方面有很大的成就，而且他的書法和篆刻作品，也為世人所稱道。</p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose prose_type:short_story style:1\"><div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\">国画大师齐白石</p></div><p class=\"passage_para\">齐白石从小就特别喜欢画画，可是因为家里穷，上不起学，也请不起绘画老师，于是他每天就用小树枝在地上练习画画，画一些花鸟，鱼虫和小动物。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">后来，为了谋生，家里让齐白石去跟着别人学习木匠手艺。工作之余，他每天都坚持练习绘画，并最终成为一代国画大师。齐白石的一生，经历丰富，充满了传奇。但是，流传最多的都是跟他的绘画有关的故事。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齐白石喜欢画荷花，他自己发明了一种叫做“红花墨叶”的手法，专门用于画荷花。他画的荷花顔色大都是红色的，而荷叶则多为墨色，而不是现实生活中的绿色。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齐白石从小在农村长大，所以他画的白菜也很有特色，叶子是翠绿色的，茎也是白亮亮的，看起来很生动。有一位出身于富贵家庭的画家，一直都想学画齐白石的白菜。但不管怎么画都不像。于是他便去请教齐白石，齐白石笑着说，“你全身上下没有一点蔬菜的气息，怎么能画得和我一样呢？”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">齐白石最出名的作品是画虾。他笔下的每一只虾好像都有生命，大到整个躯体、虾壳，小到虾尾巴，虾的触须等等，齐白石都能将他们生动地展现在人们面前。所以有人赞赏说，拥有齐白石的一幅虾画，即便不能天天吃虾，也可以大饱眼福了。可是，齐白石自己却这样说过，“我今年七十八岁了，人们都说我只会画虾，真冤啊！”</p><p

class=\"passage_para\">一天晚上，馬良在夢中看見了一團五彩的光，光影裏出現了一個白鬍子老人，老人送給他一支金光閃閃的神畫筆。馬良高興地驚醒過來，以為是個夢，可是自己的手裏真的多了一支筆！他跳起來用筆畫了一隻鳥，沒想到這隻鳥竟展開翅膀飛了起來。他又畫了一條魚，魚也活蹦亂跳起來了。自從馬良有了這支神筆，天天替村子裏窮苦善良的人家畫畫，讓窮人吃上了飯，而且誰家缺什麼，馬良就給他們畫什麼。</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">鄰村的一個貪心的大財主聽說這件事以後，馬上把馬良抓了過去，逼他為自己畫畫。但是馬良不肯。財主就把他關進了柴房裏，不給他飯吃。這天晚上天氣寒冷，財主見到柴房的門縫裏透出一絲紅色的亮光，還聞到香噴噴的味道，就向門裏看。只見馬良圍著一個大火爐，邊烤火，邊吃著熱烘烘的餅。這火爐和餅都是馬良用神筆畫出來的。財主頓時怒火中燒，衝進門去要搶他的神筆。這時馬良跨上一匹用神筆畫出來的駿馬飛奔而去。</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div

class=\"passage_para\">王強從家鄉湖南來到北京上大學，畢業以後，到一家電腦公司工作。王強白天在公司忙得連吃飯都顧不上，晚上九點以後才能回到家。說起家，其實就是一個簡單的出租屋，晚飯也就是買一份外賣帶回家吃。對這個城市來說，他就是個外來客，雖說他在這裏讀了幾年書，可還是人地兩生。遠在湖南老家的媽媽每次來電話都是催他找個對象。看他只是弄了一隻狗作伴，找對象的事卻按兵不動，媽媽就不斷地把老家的年輕女子介紹給兒子，可都被王強左推右擋地避過去了。這天晚上王強回到家，剛打開電腦，就看見一則相親的廣告，說是明湖公園週末要舉辦相親活動。王強立即報了名。到了週末那天，他便帶著狗來到公園。公園裏美女如雲，王強正想著怎麼去跟她們開始談話，忽然，有人跟他打招呼，王強回頭一看，是一位美女，看著王強笑吟吟地說：“先生，你好。我們能談談嗎？”王強連連點頭，心裏樂開了花。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">兩人走到長椅邊坐下。王強正要把狗拴在樹上，女孩兒卻招手讓狗過來。狗立刻興奮地衝過來，在女孩兒腳邊搖頭擺尾，一副親熱狀。女孩兒很開心，問王強狗幾歲了，平時乖不乖等等。女孩兒跟狗又玩了一會兒，說：“我們談正事吧。”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">王強一聽，非常高興，鼓起勇氣說：“不管你有什麼要求，我……都會答應的。”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">女孩兒吃了一驚，然後笑著說：“真的嗎？那可太好了！”王強不好意思地點點頭。這時，女孩兒掏出一張照片給王強看。王強一看，只見照片上是一隻狗，看上去還挺面熟，仔細一看，原來跟自己的狗是同一品種，頭上還繫了個紅色的蝴蝶結。女孩兒高興地說：“這是我家的莎莎，今年一歲半了，我想給她找個伴兒，可是一直沒有合適的。現在好了，真是謝謝你了。”說罷，女孩兒親熱地摸摸王強的狗。</p></div></div><div

class=\"passage_para\">自从爸爸几年前去世以后，她就一直一个人住在老人公寓。作为她的女儿，我担心她孤单，想接她来跟我们一起住，可是妈妈觉得自己还很健康，不想打扰我们的生活。妈妈还让我们不要担心她，因为在老人公寓，她可以跟其他老人作伴，每天聊聊天，散散步，有时候还可以参加老人公寓安排的各种活动，比如合唱、郊游、生日聚餐等等。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">去年，妈妈不小心跌倒，在医院动了手术。回家后，她的心情变得很不好。我看到妈妈整天不说话，闷闷不乐，好像一下子老了很多。看到妈妈的样子，我真希望她能像以前一样快乐。于是，就去找妈妈的医生咨询，医生建议让妈妈去老人中心学跳“排舞”，就是男女排成一排，随着乡村音乐的节奏跳舞。这种舞很受老年人喜爱，因为舞步缓慢，简单，很适合老人。就这样，妈妈一个星期上三天排舞课，不久就又变得开心起来了。</p><p class=\"passage_para\">上星期六是我们小镇成立八十周年的纪念日，所以举办了很多庆祝活动。妈妈原来的排舞班邀请她一起去镇上的文化中心表演。我开车去接妈妈的时候，她已经戴好了牛仔帽，穿上了牛仔靴，一身牛仔装扮，在镜子前左看右看，像孩子一样兴奋。这时我从镜子里看到的不是一个七十多岁的老人，而是一个在我记忆中，永远活在年轻时代、充满活力的妈妈。</p></div></div></div>"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB
