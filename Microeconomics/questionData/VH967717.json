[{"id":"VH967717","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity, and the values Q sub B and Q sub P are indicated from left to right, with vertical grid lines extending up from each. The vertical axis is labeled Price, and the values P sub P and P sub B are indicated from bottom to top, with horizontal grid lines extending to the right from each. The three curves are labeled M S B, M S C, and M P C. Curve M S B begins on the vertical axis above price P sub B, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the coordinates Q sub B comma P sub B, and Q sub P comma P sub P. It ends to the right of quantity Q sub P, and below price P sub P. Curve M S C begins on the vertical axis slightly below price P sub P, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects curve M S B at the point with coordinates Q sub B comma P sub B, and ends to the right of quantity Q sub P, and above price P sub B. Curve M P C begins on the vertical axis below price P sub P, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line, parallel to curve M S C. It intersects curve M S B at point with coordinates Q sub P comma P sub P, and ends to the right of quantity Q sub P, and just above price P sub B. On the graph, there are five points that are labeled A, B, C, D, and F. Point A is located where curve M P C intersects the vertical grid line at Q sub B. Point B is located directly above point A, at the intersection of curves M S B and M S C. Point C is located where curve M S C intersects the vertical grid line at Q sub P. Point D is located directly below point C, at the intersection of curves M S B and M P C. Point F is located on the vertical axis, at the start of curve M S B.\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH967717.g01.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above depicts the marginal social cost <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"open parenthesis, M S C, close parenthesis\"><math alttext=\"open parenthesis, M S C, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>MSC</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, marginal private cost <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"open parenthesis, M P C, close parenthesis\"><math alttext=\"open parenthesis, M P C, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>MPC</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, and marginal social benefit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"open parenthesis, M S B, close parenthesis\"><math alttext=\"open parenthesis, M S B, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>MSB</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> associated with the production of a good that generates an externality.
