The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 10 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 8, 40 comma 6, and 60 comma 4. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 100. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 10 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 6, 30 comma 4, and 40 comma 2. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 50 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 50 and 60. Curve M C begins between price 4 and price 5, and to the left of the quantity 10,  moves downward and to the right and passes through coordinates 10 and 3 until it reaches its lowest point slightly above price 2 and between quantities 10 and 20. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 30 comma 4, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 40 comma 6. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 50 and just below price 10. Curve A T C begins just below curve D, and just to the left of quantity 20, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 30 comma 6, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly below price 6. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right, intersects curve D, passes through the coordinates 50 comma 6, and ends at the coordinates 70 comma 8.\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250483.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
