The graph below shows the market for bakers with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Bakers,” and the following 12 numbers are indicated from left to right: 30, 45, 60, 80, 90, 100, 120, 135, 150, 160, 180, and 200. The vertical axis is labeled “Wage Rate, in U S dollars,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 4, 10, 13, 16, 20, 22, and 40. The three curves in the graph are labeled “Marginal Factor Cost,” “Supply,” and “Marginal Revenue Product.” The Marginal Factor Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at $4 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 30 comma $10, 45 comma $13, 60 comma $16, 80 comma $20, and 90 comma $22. The Marginal Factor Cost curve ends at wage rate $40, and just to the left of quantity 180. The Supply curve also begins on the vertical axis at $4 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 60 comma $10, 90 comma $13, 120 comma $16, 160 comma $20, and 180 comma $22. The Supply curve ends slightly above wage rate $22 and at quantity 200. The Marginal Revenue Product curve begins on the vertical axis at $40 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Marginal Factor Cost curve at 90 comma $22, passes through the point with coordinates 100 comma $20, then intersects the Supply curve at 120 comma $16, and passes through the points with coordinates 135 comma $13, and 150 comma $10. The Marginal Revenue Product curve ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 200.\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250529.g01.png\" width=\"575\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) If the wage rate is $13, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of bakers and calculate its size. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Identify the profit-maximizing number of bakers that Bobby’s Bakehouse will hire.

Explain using the labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) If the marginal product of bakers increases, what will happen to the quantity of output produced by Bobby’s Bakehouse? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume instead that Bobby’s Bakehouse uses both labor and capital in its production of baked goods. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 16 baked goods per hour and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 50 baked goods per hour; the hourly wage rate for labor is $8 and the hourly rental price for capital is $5. To minimize the cost of producing its current level of output, should Bobby’s Bakehouse rent more capital, less capital, or the same amount of capital? Explain using marginal analysis.</p>\n"}]}]
