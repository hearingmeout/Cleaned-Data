The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 100 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 80, 40 comma 60, and 60 comma 40. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 100. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 100 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 60, 30 comma 40, and 40 comma 20. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 50 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 50 and 60. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 10 comma 30 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 20 and between quantities 10 and 20. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 30 comma 40, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 40 comma 60. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 50 and just above price 90. Curve A T C begins above price 90, and just to the left of quantity 30, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 30 comma 90, begins to level out, reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at price 70. From this point, curve A T C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, and ends just above price 90 and between quantities 70 and 80.\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250477.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
