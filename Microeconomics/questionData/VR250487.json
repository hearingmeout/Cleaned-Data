The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 40, in increments of 4, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 20 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 8 comma 16, 16 comma 12, and 24 comma 8. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 40. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 20 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 8 comma 12, 12 comma 8, and 16 comma 4. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 20 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 20 and 24. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 4 comma 6 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 4 and between quantities 4 and 8. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 12 comma 8, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 16 comma 12. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 20 and just below price 18. Curve A T C begins just below curve D, and just to the left of quantity 8, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 12 comma 12, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly below price 12. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right, intersects curve D, and passes through the coordinates 24 comma 14. Curve A T C ends just above price 16, and at quantity 28.\" height=\"242\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250487.g01.png\" width=\"345\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
