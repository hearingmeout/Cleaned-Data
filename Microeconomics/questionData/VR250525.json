The graph below shows the market for machinists with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Machinists,” and the following 11 numbers are indicated from left to right: 105, 150, 210, 240, 300, 380, 420, 480, 560, 600, and 800. The vertical axis is labeled “Wage Rate, in U S dollars,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 15, 36, 45, 57, 63, 75, and 120. The three curves in the graph are labeled “Marginal Factor Cost,” “Supply,” and “Marginal Revenue Product.” The Marginal Factor Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at $15 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 105 comma $36, 150 comma $45, 210 comma $57, 240 comma $63, and 300 comma $75. The Marginal Factor Cost curve ends at wage rate $120 and at quantity 480. The Supply curve also begins on the vertical axis at $15 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 210 comma $36, 300 comma $45, 420 comma $57, 480 comma $63, and 600 comma $75. The Supply curve ends between wage rates $75 and $120, and at quantity 800. The Marginal Revenue Product curve begins on the vertical axis at $120 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Marginal Factor Cost curve at 300 comma $75, passes through the point with coordinates 380 comma $63, then intersects the Supply curve at 420 comma $57, and passes through the points with coordinates 480 comma $45, and 560 comma $36. The Marginal Revenue Product curve ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 800.\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250525.g01.png\" width=\"575\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) If the wage rate is $63, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of machinists and calculate its size. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Identify the profit-maximizing number of machinists. Explain using the labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Identify the profit-maximizing wage rate that Central Manufacturing Company will pay its machinists. Explain using the labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) If the marginal product of machinists increases, what will happen to the quantity of output produced by Central Manufacturing Company? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume instead that Central Manufacturing Company uses both labor and capital in producing widgets. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 120 widgets per day and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 150 widgets per day; the daily wage rate for labor is $40 and the daily rental price for capital is $30. To minimize the cost of producing its current level of output, should Central Manufacturing Company rent more capital, less capital, or the same amount of capital? Explain using marginal analysis.</p>\n"}]}]
