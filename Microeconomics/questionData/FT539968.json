Two values W and U are labeled on the vertical axis, with W less than U, and two values K and M are labeled on the horizontal axis with K less than M. Two lines are plotted starting in the upper left corner above U and decreasing to the right. The upper line labeled demand does not reach the horizontal axis, and the lower line labeled marginal revenue crosses the horizontal axis between K and M. Two curves are plotted that are concave up everywhere, starting by decreasing on the left then reaching a minimum and increasing on the right. The first curve is labeled average total cost which starts on the left above the demand line and touches, but does not cross, the demand line as it decreases at the point price U and quantity K as indicated by reference lines. The curve then reaches its minimum and increases, staying always above the demand line. The second curve starts on the left between U and W and to the left of K, then decreases below W and reaches its minimum still to the left of K. It increases to the right and crosses the marginal revenue line at quantity K, then crosses the demand line at quantity M and price W as indicated by reference lines, and finally crosses the average total cost curve near its minimum.\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/0ac41f940e6b4faccefce7f23c794b3d/original.jpg\" width=\"573\">\n<p>The graph above depicts cost and revenue curves for a typical firm in a monopolistically competitive industry.
