The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from left to right: 10, 22, 33, 45, 58, and 78. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $12, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 45 comma $12, 58 comma $10, and 78 comma $8. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 78, and between prices $5 and $7. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 45 comma $7, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 58 and 78, and ends below the horizontal axis, and just to the right of quantity 78. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $12, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It moves above and to the right of the Demand curve, and reaches its lowest point just above price $12 and just to the right of quantity 58. The Average Total Cost curve then turns to move upward and to the right, and ends to the right of quantity 78, above price $12, and below where the Demand curve begins on the vertical axis. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $7, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 33 comma $5, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $5 and between quantities 45 and 58, and then intersects the Demand curve at 78 comma $8. The Average Variable Cost curve ends almost directly below where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $10 and $12. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 22 comma $4, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 33 comma $5, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 45 comma $7. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Demand curve at 58 comma $10, and then intersects the Average Total Cost curve at its lowest point just to the right of quantity 58. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $12 and between quantities 58 and 78.\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217766.g01.png\" width=\"440\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">GaterTools, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a power tool, making it the only producer of that power tool. The graph above shows GaterTools’ demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Calculate GaterTools’ total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Starting at a price of $12, if GaterTools were to increase the price by 4%, will the quantity demanded decrease by more than 4%, less than 4%, or exactly 4%? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) At a quantity of 10 units, is GaterTools’ marginal product increasing, decreasing, or constant? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Identify the quantity that maximizes GaterTools’ profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) At the quantity identified in part (d), does GaterTools earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that GaterTools’ patent expires. HandyBilt, a company with the capability to produce the same power tool as GaterTools, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than GaterTools for the power tool. GaterTools is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match HandyBilt’s price. HandyBilt is considering whether to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (GaterTools and HandyBilt) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents GaterTools’ payoff and the second entry represents HandyBilt’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
