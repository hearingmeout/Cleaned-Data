The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 60, in increments of 6, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 30, in increments of 3, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 30 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 12 comma 24, 24 comma 18, and 36 comma 12. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 60. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 30 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 12 comma 18, 18 comma 12, and 24 comma 6. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 30 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 30 and 36. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 6 comma 9 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 6 and between quantities 6 and 12. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 18 comma 12, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 24 comma 18. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 30 and just below price 27. Curve A T C begins just below price 30, and just to the left of quantity 18, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 18 comma 27 and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at the approximate coordinates 27 comma 21. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right and ends just above price 27, and between quantities 42 and 48.\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250493.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
