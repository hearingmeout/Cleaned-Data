The graph below shows the market for beauticians with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Beauticians,” and the following 10 numbers are indicated from left to right: 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 180, 216, and 240. The vertical axis is labeled “Wage Rate, in U S dollars,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 24, 60, 78, 96, 114, 132, and 240. The three curves in the graph are labeled “Marginal Factor Cost,” “Supply,” and “Marginal Revenue Product.” The Marginal Factor Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at $24 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 36 comma $60, 54 comma $78, 72 comma $96, 90 comma $114, and 108 comma $132. The Marginal Factor Cost curve ends at wage rate $240, and just to the left of quantity 216. The Supply curve also begins on the vertical axis at $24 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 72 comma $60, 108 comma $78, 144 comma $96, 180 comma $114, and 216 comma $132. The Supply curve ends slightly above wage rate $132 and at quantity 240. The Marginal Revenue Product curve begins on the vertical axis at $240 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Marginal Factor Cost curve at 108 comma $132, passes through the point with coordinates 126 comma $114, then intersects the Supply curve at 144 comma $96, and passes through the point with coordinates 180 comma $60. The Marginal Revenue Product curve ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 240.\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250517.g01.png\" width=\"580\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a Identify the profit-maximizing number of beauticians that Karen’s Cuts will hire.

What wage rate would Karen’s Cuts pay its beauticians if it were a perfectly competitive firm? Explain using labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume instead that Karen’s Cuts uses both labor and capital in providing its services. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 30 cuts per day and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 20 cuts per day; the daily wage rate for labor is $60 and the daily rental price for capital is $20. To minimize the cost of providing its current level of services, should Karen’s Cuts hire more beauticians, fewer beauticians, or the same number of beauticians? Explain using marginal analysis.</p>\n"}]}]
