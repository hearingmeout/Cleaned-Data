The horizontal axis is labeled “Cloth, in yards,” and the numbers 50 and 300 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Wheat, in bushels,” and the number 100 is indicated. The curves in the graph are labeled Northland and Southland. The Northland curve begins on the vertical axis at 100 bushels of wheat, moves downward and to the right in a straight line, and ends on the horizontal axis at 300 yards of cloth. The Southland curve begins where the Northland curve begins on the vertical axis at 100 bushels of wheat, and moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line, below the Northland curve.

Assuming no other changes, will Southland have a comparative advantage in producing cloth? Explain using numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Turnips are produced in a perfectly competitive market in Alderia, a third country, which does not engage in international trade. Runoff from turnip fields pollutes Alderia’s rivers, hurting its residents.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_item\">\n\t<p class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) Does the turnip market equilibrium result in an efficient allocation of resources?

What will be the impact on the turnip market equilibrium price and quantity in the short run?</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
