The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from left to right: 11, 25, 37, 54, 70, 96, and 107. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 5 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 5, 9, 10, 13, and 15. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $15, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 54 comma $15, 70 comma $13, 96 comma $10, and 107 comma $9. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 107, and between prices $5 and $9. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 54 comma $9, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 70 and 96, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 96. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $15, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It touches the Demand curve at 54 comma $15, and then begins to move downward and to the right more slowly. The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point just to the right of quantity 70 and between prices $13 and $15. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and ends just to the right of quantity 107, above price $15, and below where the Demand curve begins on the vertical axis. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $9, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at quantity 37 and just above price $5, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve between quantities 54 and 70, and then intersects the Demand curve at 96 comma $10. The Average Variable Cost curve ends almost directly below where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $13 and $15. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 25 comma $5, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at quantity 37, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 54 comma $9. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Demand curve at 70 comma $13, and then intersects the Average Total Cost curve just above price $13. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $15 and just to the left of quantity 96.\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217771.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">TechnoParts, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on an electronic component, making it the only producer of that electronic component. The graph above shows TechnoParts’ demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes TechnoParts’ profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does TechnoParts earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Calculate TechnoParts’ total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) At a price of $5, will TechnoParts continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume that at 70 units, the average total cost is $14. If the total property taxes paid by TechnoParts increase by $280, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that TechnoParts’ patent expires. Faradaze, a company with the capability to produce the same electronic component as TechnoParts, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than TechnoParts for the electronic component. TechnoParts is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match Faradaze’s price. Faradaze is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (TechnoParts and Faradaze) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents TechnoParts’ payoff and the second entry represents Faradaze’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
