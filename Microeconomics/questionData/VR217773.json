The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from left to right: 6, 16, 23, 33, 44, 58, and 62. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 10, 12, 18, 21, 27, and 32. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $32, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 33 comma $32, 44 comma $27, 58 comma $21, and 62 comma $18. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 62, and between prices $12 and $18. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 33 comma $18, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 44 and 58, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 58. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $32, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It intersects the Demand curve above price $32, and almost touches the Marginal Revenue curve between prices $27 and $32 before it begins to move downward and to the right more slowly. The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point just above price $21 and between quantities 33 and 44. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve again between quantities 44 and 58. The Average Total Cost curve ends to the right of quantity 62, and just above price $32. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $18, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 23 comma $12, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $12 and between quantities 33 and 44, and then intersects the Demand curve at 58 comma $21. The Average Variable Cost curve ends almost directly below where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $27 and $32. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 16 comma $10, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 23 comma $12, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 33 comma $18. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Average Total Cost curve at its lowest point between quantities 33 and 44, and then intersects the Demand curve at 44 comma $27. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $32 and just to the left of quantity 58.\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217773.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">EyesOn, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on cameras, making it the only producer of that camera. The graph above shows EyesOn’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes EyesOn’s profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does EyesOn earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Calculate EyesOn’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) At a price of $10, will EyesOn continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume that at 44 units, the average total cost is $22. If the total wages paid by EyesOn increase by $220, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that EyesOn’s patent expires. ViewTime, a company with the capability to produce the same camera as EyesOn, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than EyesOn for the camera. EyesOn is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match ViewTime’s price. ViewTime is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (EyesOn and ViewTime) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents EyesOn’s payoff and the second entry represents ViewTime’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
