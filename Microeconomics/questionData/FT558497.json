One quantity appears on the horizontal axis, to the right of the origin, labeled Q. Three prices appear on the vertical axis, starting above the origin, labeled from bottom to top, H, G, and F. Three lines appear on the graph. A curved line labeled Marginal Cost begins slightly below the price H on the vertical axis and between the origin and quantity Q on the horizontal axis. It curves steeply upwards and to the right crossing through a point labeled l with coordinates of quantity Q and price H, and ending slightly above price F and to the right of quantity Q. A straight line labeled Marginal Revenue starts at price F on the vertical axis and moves steeply downwards and to the right. It intersects the Marginal Cost curve at a point labeled l with coordinates of quantity Q and price H, and ends below the horizontal axis to the right of quantity Q. A straight line labeled Demand starts at the same price F on the vertical axis, as the Marginal Revenue line and moves downward and to the right. It crosses through a point labeled K with coordinates of quantity Q and price G. it intersects the Marginal Cost curve at a point labeled J with coordinates of quantity greater than Q and price between G and H, and ends slightly above the horizontal axis. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/a8545f0361db0536a8099417749a0bc0/original.png\">"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>FGK</p>","<p>FHI</p>","<p>IJK</p>","<p>GHIK</p>","<p>0HIQ</p>"],"answer":1}]
