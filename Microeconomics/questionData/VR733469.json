The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity.” The value Q sub 1 is indicated slightly to the right of the vertical axis, and the value Q sub 2 is indicated about three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Price.” The value P sub 1 is indicated one third of the way up the vertical axis, and the value P sub 2 is indicated three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. One curve is labeled Supply and one curve is labeled Demand. The Supply curve begins on the vertical axis, halfway between the origin and P sub 1. It moves upward and to the right in a straight line, and passes through the points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, and Q sub 2 comma P sub 2. The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis above P sub 2, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2, and Q sub 2 comma P sub 1. There is a shaded trapezoidal region bounded from below by a horizontal dashed line at P sub 1 that extends from the vertical axis to the Supply curve, bounded on the left by a segment of the vertical axis extending from P sub 1 to the point where the Demand Curve begins, bounded from above by the portion of the Demand curve that extends from where it begins on the vertical axis to the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2, and bounded on the right by a dashed vertical line at Q sub 1 that extends from the Demand curve to the Supply curve.\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR733469.g04.svg\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Consumer surplus could be the shaded area in which of the following situations?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR733469_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A price floor set at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P sub 1\"><math alttext=\"P sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></math></span></span> in the market</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A price floor set at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P sub 2\"><math alttext=\"P sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> in the market</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A price ceiling set at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P sub 1\"><math alttext=\"P sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>P</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> in the market</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A per-unit subsidy equal to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P sub 2, minus P sub 1\"><math alttext=\"P sub 2, minus P sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></span></span> granted to producers</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A per-unit tax equal to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"P sub 2, minus P sub 1\"><math alttext=\"P sub 2, minus P sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>−</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></span></span> imposed on producers</p>"],"answer":2}]
