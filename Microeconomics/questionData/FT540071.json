Three curves are drawn that are concave up everywhere but are decreasing on the left, reach a minimum, and increase to the right. The top curve is labeled average total cost, and has its minimum near the center of the graph. The next curve is labeled average variable cost and sits below the average total cost curve. Its minimum is below and to the left of that for the average total cost curve, and the curve is wider so they do not cross. The third curve is labeled marginal cost, and its minimum is in the lower left corner of the graph. It crosses both the average and variable cost curves near their minimums as it increases to the right. A value P 1 is labeled near the top of the vertical axis, and a horizontal line is plotted at this height. It crosses the average total cost curve twice, once on either side of its minimum, the marginal cost curve once between the two crossings with the average total cost curve, and the average variable cost curve once to the right of the other two curves. \" height=\"212\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/57ee16441797d524af14dd0b6fc18740/original.jpg\" width=\"319\"></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows the short-run cost curves of a firm in a perfectly competitive market.
