A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes. If the question prompts you to “Calculate,” you must show how you arrived at your final answer.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">On the Island of Gratin, potatoes are produced in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry. The market for potatoes is currently in long-run equilibrium at the market price of $5 per sac.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Draw a correctly labeled graph for the potato market and for farmer Lamo, and show each of the following.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) The market equilibrium quantity and price, labeled <span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><math overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>M</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and $5, respectively</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(ii) The quantity produced and the price for farmer Lamo, labeled <span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><math overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and $5, respectively</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Believing that the incomes of potato farmers are unfairly low, the government of Gratin imposes a binding price floor at $7 per sac. The government will purchase any surpluses of potatoes. On your graph in part (a) show the following.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) The market quantity of potatoes that would be supplied at the price floor, labeled <span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><math overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>F</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(ii) The profit farmer Lamo earns, shaded completely</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) If the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is 0.92, would consumer spending on potatoes increase, decrease, or stay the same as a result of the price floor? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) How would the price floor affect the demand for labor by potato farmers?</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Potatoes, corn, and rice are all produced on the island of Gratin in perfectly competitive markets.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) Assume corn is a substitute in production (an alternate output) for potatoes. How would setting the price floor on potatoes affect the equilibrium price and quantity of corn? Explain.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(ii) As a result of an increase in the price of rice, the demand for potatoes increased. Are rice and potatoes substitutes or complements in consumption?</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
