The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity of Labor, and the vertical axis is labeled Wage. There are two quantities indicated on the horizontal axis that are labeled, from left to right, L sub 0 and L sub 1.  Quantity L sub 0 lies about one sixth of the way along the horizontal axis, and quantity L sub 1 lies about half way along the horizontal axis. There are two prices indicated on the vertical axis that are labeled, from bottom to top, $10 and $15. Price $10 lies about half way up the vertical axis, and price $15 lies about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. The graph has two lines that are labeled M F C and M R P sub L. Line M F C begins at $10 on the vertical axis, and moves horizontally and to the right. Line M R P sub L begins on the vertical axis, and slightly above $15. It moves downward and to the right, passes through the coordinate L sub 0 comma $15, and intersects the line M F C at the coordinate L sub 1 comma $10. It ends slightly above the horizontal axis, and to the right of L sub 1.\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH968901.g03.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the graph above, which of the following statements is true?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH968901_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Hiring unit of labor <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L sub 0\"><math alttext=\"L sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> will add <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"$15\"><math alttext=\"$15\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> to a firm’s economic profits.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The market wage rate is <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"$10\"><math alttext=\"$10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> per unit of labor.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The profit-maximizing firm will hire its labor at less than <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"$10\"><math alttext=\"$10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>10</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> per unit.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">From <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"0\"><math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> units of labor to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L sub 0\"><math alttext=\"L sub 0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> units of labor, there are increasing marginal returns to labor.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Along the firm’s marginal revenue product of labor curve, the price of output falls as more labor is hired and more output is produced.</p>"],"answer":1}]
