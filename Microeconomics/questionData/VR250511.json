The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 50, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 40, in increments of 4, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 40 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 10 comma 32, 20 comma 24, and 30 comma 16. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 50. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 40 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 10 comma 24, 15 comma 16, and 20 comma 8. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 25 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 25 and 30. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 5 comma 12 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 8 and between quantities 5 and 10. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 15 comma 16, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 20 comma 24. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 25 and just below price 36. Curve A T C begins just above curve D, and just to the right of quantity 10, and moves downward and to the right. It intersects curve D, passes through the coordinates 15 comma 24, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly below price 24, and between the quantities 15 and 20. From this point, curve A T C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve D again, and ends just below price 36 and just to the left of quantity 35.\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250511.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
