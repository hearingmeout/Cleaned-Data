The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 80, in increments of 8, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 80 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 64, 40 comma 48, and 60 comma 32. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 100. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 80 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 20 comma 48, 30 comma 32, and 40 comma 16. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 50 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 50 and 60. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 10 comma 24 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 16 and between quantities 10 and 20. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 30 comma 32, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 40 comma 48. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 50 and just below price 72. Curve A T C begins just above curve D, and just to the right of quantity 20, and moves downward and to the right. It intersects curve D, passes through the coordinates 30 comma 48, begins to level out, reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly below price 48. From this point, curve A T C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve D again, and ends just below price 72 and at quantity 70.\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250507.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
