The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from left to right: 9, 20, 29, 43, 56, 75, and 108. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 20, 24, 45, 68, 81, and 98. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $98, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 43 comma $98, 56 comma $81, 75 comma $68, and 108 comma $45. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 108, and between prices $24 and $45. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 43 comma $45, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 56 and 75, and ends below the horizontal axis and just to the right of quantity 75. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $98, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It touches the Demand curve at 43 comma $98, and then begins to move downward and to the right more slowly. The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point just to the right of quantity 56 and between prices $81 and $98. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and ends just to the right of quantity 108, above price $98, and below where the Demand curve begins on the vertical axis. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $45, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 29 comma $24, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $24 and between quantities 43 and 56, and then intersects the Demand curve at 75 comma $68. The Average Variable Cost curve ends just to the right of where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $81 and $98. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 20 comma $20, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 29 comma $24, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 43 comma $45. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Demand curve at 56 comma $81, and then intersects the Average Total Cost curve between prices $81 and $98. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $98 and between quantities 56 and 75.\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217765.g02.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">BetterCook, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a kitchen appliance, making it the only producer of that appliance. The graph above shows BetterCook’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Calculate BetterCook’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Starting at a price of $68, if BetterCook were to decrease the price by 3%, will the quantity demanded increase by more than 3%, by less than 3%, or by exactly 3%? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) At a quantity of 29 units, is BetterCook’s marginal product increasing, decreasing, or constant? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Identify the quantity that maximizes BetterCook’s profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) At the quantity identified in part (d), does BetterCook earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that BetterCook’s patent expires. Scheff, a company with the capability to produce the same kitchen appliance as BetterCook, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than BetterCook for the kitchen appliance. BetterCook is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match Scheff’s price. Scheff is considering whether to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (BetterCook and Scheff) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents BetterCook’s payoff and the second entry represents Scheff’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
