The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 30, in increments of 3, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 30 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 4 comma 24, 8 comma 18, and 12 comma 12. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 20. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 30 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 4 comma 18, 6 comma 12, and 8 comma 6. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 10 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 10 and 12. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 2 comma 9 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 6 and between quantities 2 and 4. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 6 comma 12, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 8 comma 18. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 10 and just below price 27. Curve A T C begins to the left of the point with coordinates 6 comma 30 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at the approximate coordinates 9 comma 21. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right, and ends just above price 27 and between quantities 14 and 16.\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250513.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
