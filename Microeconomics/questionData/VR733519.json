The S line begins at approximate coordinates 5 comma $10 and moves upward and to the right. It passes through coordinates 20 comma $16; 40 comma $24; and 60 comma $32. The M R P line begins at approximate coordinates 5 comma $76, moves downward and to the right, passes through coordinates 10 comma $72, and intersects the M F C line at coordinates 40 comma $48.
