Three curves are shown, all concave up everywhere, decreasing on the left before reaching a minimum and increasing to the right. The first curve is labeled long-run average total cost, which has its minimum near the center of the graph. The second curve is labeled short-run average total cost which has its minimum above and to the left of the long-run average total cost curve. The two curves touch, but do not intersect, to the right of the minimum of the long-run average total cost-curve, so the short-run average total cost curve is always above the other curve. The third curve labeled short-run marginal cost has its minimum in the lower left corner and intersects the short-run then the long-run average total cost curves to the right of the point where those two curves touch. A value P sub 1 is labeled on the vertical axis above all of the minimums and a horizontal reference line is drawn there, intersecting the long-run and short-run average total cost curves near the point where they touch before intersecting the short-run marginal cost curve. A value Q sub 1 is labeled on the horizontal axis with a vertical reference line drawn that intersects the long-run then short-run average total cost curves. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d74e19cadf8e8915f57e94962195ead4/original.jpg\"/></p>"}],"choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Short Run</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Long Run</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Increasing marginal returns</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Economies of scale</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Short Run</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Long Run</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Increasing marginal returns</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Diseconomies of scale</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Short Run</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Long Run</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Diminishing marginal returns</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Economies of scale</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Short Run</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Long Run</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Diminishing marginal returns</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Diseconomies of scale</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Short Run</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Long Run</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Constant marginal returns</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Diseconomies of scale</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":1}]
