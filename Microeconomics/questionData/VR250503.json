The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 300, in increments of 30, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 20 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 60 comma 16, 120 comma 12, and 180 comma 8. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 300. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 20 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 60 comma 12, 90 comma 8, and 120 comma 4. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 150 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 150 and 180. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 30 comma 6 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 4 and between quantities 30 and 60. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 90 comma 8, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 120 comma 12. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 150 and just below price 18. Curve A T C begins just below price 16, and just to the left of quantity 60, and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at the approximate coordinates 100 comma 10. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right, intersects curve D at the approximate coordinates 130 comma 11, passes through the coordinates 150 comma 12, and ends just to the right of quantity 210, and just below price 18.\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250503.g02.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
