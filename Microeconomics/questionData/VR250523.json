The graph below shows the market for leather workers with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Leather Workers,” and the following 11 numbers are indicated from left to right: 60, 120, 180, 200, 240, 320, 360, 400, 480, 600, and 800. The vertical axis is labeled “Wage Rate, in U S dollars,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 32, 80, 128, 176, 192, 224, and 320. The three curves in the graph are labeled “Marginal Factor Cost,” “Supply,” and “Marginal Revenue Product.” The Marginal Factor Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at $32 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 60 comma $80, 120 comma $128, 180 comma $176, 200 comma $192, and 240 comma $224. The Marginal Factor Cost curve ends at wage rate $320, and between quantities 320 and 360. The Supply curve also begins on the vertical axis at $32 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 120 comma $80, 240 comma $128, 360 comma $176, 400 comma $192, and 480 comma $224. The Supply curve ends at wage rate $320, and between quantities 600 and 800. The Marginal Revenue Product curve begins on the vertical axis at $320 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Marginal Factor Cost curve at 240 comma $224, passes through the point with coordinates 320 comma $192, then intersects the Supply curve at 360 comma $176, and passes through the points with coordinates 480 comma $128, and 600 comma $80. The Marginal Revenue Product curve ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 800.\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250523.g01.png\" width=\"650\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) If the wage rate is $192, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of leather workers and calculate its size. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Identify the profit-maximizing number of leather workers that Henri’s Handbags will hire.

Explain using the labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Assume that the market for leather workers becomes perfectly competitive. What wage rate would Henri’s Handbags pay its leather workers if it were a perfectly competitive firm? Explain using labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume instead that Henri’s Handbags uses both labor and capital in its production of handbags. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 180 handbags per hour and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 160 handbags per hour; the hourly wage rate for labor is $60 and the hourly rental price for capital is $20. To minimize the cost of producing its current level of output, should Henri’s Handbags hire more leather workers, fewer leather workers, or the same number of leather workers? Explain using marginal analysis.</p>\n"}]}]
