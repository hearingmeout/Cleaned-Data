The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 100 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 80, 4 comma 60, and 6 comma 40. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 10. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 100 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 60, 3 comma 40, and 4 comma 20. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 5 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 5 and 6. Curve M C begins just to the left of quantity 1 and at price 40 and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 1 comma 30 and reaches its lowest point just above price 20, and between quantities 1 and 2. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 3 comma 40, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 4 comma 60. Curve M C ends at price 90 and between quantities 5 and 6. Curve A T C begins just below price 100, and just to the left of quantity 3, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 3 comma 90 and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at price 70, and between quantities 4 and 5. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right and ends just above price 90, and between quantities 7 and 8.\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250485.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
