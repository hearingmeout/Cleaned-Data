The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Price”.  There are two quantities on the horizontal axis. The quantity Q 2 appears about halfway across the horizontal axis. The quantity Q 1 is between the origin and Q 2 but is closer to Q 2 than it is to the origin. Four prices appear along the vertical axis. From bottom to top, the prices are P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4. The distance between P 1 and the origin is larger than the distance between P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4. P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4 are an equal distance apart from one another.  There are four points on the graph: e, f, g, and h. Point e is at coordinate Q 1 comma P 3. Point f is at coordinate Q 1 and P 1. Point g is at coordinate Q 2 comma P 4, and coordinate h is at coordinate Q 2 and P 2.  A straight line, labeled D equals M S B, passes through points e and h and continues straight on both sides.  Another straight line, labeled S equals M P C, passes through points f and h and continues as a straight line on both sides of those points. Lastly, a straight line, labeled M S C, passes through points e and g. This straight line continues down and to the left of point e until it hits the vertical axis. This line extends up and to the right of point g, ending in the upper right hand quadrant of the graph.\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/835ec7397f3c1da9d65e73216e40bfd5/original.jpg\" width=\"265\" /></p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Type of E<u>xternality</u></td><td class=\"text-center\">Deadweight <u>Loss</u></td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Positive</td><td class=\"text-center\">egh</td></tr></tbody></table>","<table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Type of E<u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">xternality</u></td><td class=\"text-center\">Deadweight <u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loss</u></td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Positive</td><td class=\"text-center\">ehf</td></tr></tbody></table>","<table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Type of E<u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">xternality</u></td><td class=\"text-center\">Deadweight <u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loss</u></td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Negative</td><td class=\"text-center\">ehf</td></tr></tbody></table>","<table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Type of E<u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">xternality</u></td><td class=\"text-center\">Deadweight <u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loss</u></td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Negative</td><td class=\"text-center\">egh</td></tr></tbody></table>","<table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Type of E<u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">xternality</u></td><td class=\"text-center\">Deadweight <u style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Loss</u></td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-center\">Negative</td><td class=\"text-center\">P<sub>4</sub>ghP<sub>2</sub></td></tr></tbody></table>"],"answer":2}]
