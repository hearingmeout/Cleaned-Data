Values Q 1, Q 2, Q 3, and Q 4 are labeled on the horizontal axis, with Q 1 and Q 2 near the origin and Q 3 and Q 4 further apart and near the center of the axis. A straight, increasing line is drawn from the origin through the center of the graph, and this line is labeled total revenue. A curve labeled total cost is also drawn that starts on the vertical axis just above the origin where it is increasing and concave down. A dashed vertical line is drawn from Q 1 on the horizontal axis to this part of the curve. The curve then becomes nearly horizontal as it crosses the total revenue line for the first time, and a dashed vertical line is drawn from Q 2 on the horizontal axis to this intersection. The curve, which is now below the total revenue line, then becomes increasing and concave up, and a vertical dashed line is drawn from Q 3 on the horizontal axis through the total cost line and ending on the total revenue line. The total cost line then crosses the total revenue line again, and a vertical dashed line is drawn from Q 4 on the horizontal axis to this intersection. \" height=\"229\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/fdcd355fdaadb123c84085e55281b437/original.jpg\" width=\"298\">\n<p>The graph above shows the total revenue and total cost curves for a firm in which type of market structure and what is the profit-maximizing quantity?</p>","choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Market Structure</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Quantity</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Monopoly</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>2</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Market Structure</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Quantity</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Monopoly</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>3</sub></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Market Structure</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Quantity</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Perfect Competition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>1</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Market Structure</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Quantity</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Perfect Competition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>3</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Market Structure</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Quantity</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Perfect Competition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>4</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":2}]
