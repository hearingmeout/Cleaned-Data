The vertical axis of the graph is labeled &quot;Price (cost)&quot; with points P 1, P 2, P 3, and P 4 marked on it from bottom to top. Three curves labeled curve 1, curve 2, and curve 3 are plotted. Curve 1 is marked with two points L and J, with L lying at a point opposite and between P 3 and P 4 on the vertical axis and J lying opposite P 1. Curve 2 is marked with two points R and S, with R and S both lying at a point opposite P 4. Curve 3 is marked with two points K and T, with K lying opposite and between P 2 and P 3 and T lying opposite P 3 on the vertical axis.
