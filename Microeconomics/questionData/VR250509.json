The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 40, in increments of 4, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 60, in increments of 6, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 60 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 8 comma 48, 16 comma 36, and 24 comma 24. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 40. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 60 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 8 comma 36, 12 comma 24, and 16 comma 12. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 20 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 20 and 24. Curve M C begins slightly to the left of quantity 4 and slightly above the price 18 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 12 and between quantities 4 and 8. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 12 comma 24, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 16 comma 36. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 20 and just above price 54. Curve A T C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 11 comma 60 and steeply moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 12 comma 54, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly above price 42, and between quantities 16 and 20. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right and ends slightly above price 54, and between quantities 28 and 32.\" height=\"313\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250509.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) , marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
