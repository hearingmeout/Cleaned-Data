A line is plotted on the graph that is labeled demand and starts near the top of the vertical axis, above the value 11, and decreases to the right, ending on the horizontal axis. Two other parallel lines are plotted on the graph, with the upper line labeled supply after tax and the lower line labeled supply. Both lines start on the vertical axis below 9.45 and increase to the right. The upper line crosses the demand line at quantity Q prime and price 10.45, and dashed reference lines are drawn from the axes to this intersection. The lower line crosses the demand line at quantity Q and price 10, and dashed reference lines are drawn from the axes to this intersection.
