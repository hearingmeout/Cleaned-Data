The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 1, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 10 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 8, 4 comma 6, and 6 comma 4. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 10. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 10 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 6, 3 comma 4, and 4 comma 2. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 5 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 5 and 6. Curve M C begins at the point with the approximate coordinates 1 comma 3 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 2 and between quantities 1 and 2. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 3 comma 4, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 4 comma 6. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 5 and just below price 9. Curve A T C begins just below curve D, and just to the left of quantity 2, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 3 comma 6, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C slightly below price 6. From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right, intersects curve D, passes through the coordinates 5 comma 6, and ends at the coordinates 7 comma 8.\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250475.g01.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
