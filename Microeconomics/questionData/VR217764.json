The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from left to right: 10, 21, 31, 44, 57, and 77. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 30, 35, 55, 68, 100, and 108. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $108, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 44 comma $108, 57 comma $100, and 77 comma $68. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 77, and between prices $35 and $55. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 44 comma $55, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 57 and 77, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 77. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $108, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It intersects the Demand curve above price $108, and almost touches the Marginal Revenue curve at price $100 before it begins to move downward and to the right more slowly. The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point, where it intersects the marginal cost curve, just above price $68 and between quantities 44 and 57. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve again between quantities 57 and 77. The Average Total Cost curve ends to the right of quantity 77, and just above price $108. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $55, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point, where it intersects the Marginal Cost curve at coordinates 31 comma $35, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $35 and between quantities 44 and 57, and then intersects the Demand curve at 77 comma $68. The Average Variable Cost curve ends just to the right of where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $100 and $108. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 21 comma $30, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 31 comma $35, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 44 comma $55. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Average Total Cost curve at its lowest point between quantities 44 and 57, and then intersects the Demand curve at 57 comma $100. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $108 and just to the left of quantity 77.\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217764.g01.png\" width=\"420\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">BigMed, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a medical device, making it the only producer of that device.

Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) At a quantity of 10 units, is BigMed’s marginal product increasing, decreasing, or constant? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Identify the quantity that maximizes BigMed’s profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) At the quantity identified in part (d), does BigMed earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that BigMed’s patent expires. Tauem, a company with the capability to produce the same medical device as BigMed, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than BigMed for the medical device. BigMed is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match Tauem’s price. Tauem is considering whether to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (BigMed and Tauem) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents BigMed’s payoff and the second entry represents Tauem’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
