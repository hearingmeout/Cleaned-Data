The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity in Tons,” and the numbers 0 through 5, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost per Ton, in dollars,” and the numbers 0 through 600, in increments of 100, are indicated. The three curves are labeled A V C, M C, and A T C. The behavior of each curve is as follows. Note that all coordinates are approximate. Curve A V C begins at the point with coordinates 0.1 comma $20 and moves upward and to the right. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma $105 and 3.5 comma $160, and ends at the point with coordinates 4.3 comma $250. Curve A T C begins at the point with coordinates 0 comma $20 and moves upward and to the right. It passes through points with coordinates 1 comma $100 and 3 comma $250, and ends at the point with coordinates 4.3 comma $370. Curve M C begins at the point with coordinates 0.1 comma $430 and moves downward and to the right until it reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve A T C at the point with coordinates 1 comma $100. From there, curve M C moves upward and to the right, passes through the point with coordinates 3 comma $340, and ends at the point with coordinates 4.3 comma $580.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR188596.g08.png\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>MC</mi></math></span></span>), average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ATC</mi></math></span></span>), and average variable cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A V C\"><math alttext=\"A V C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>AVC</mi></math></span></span>) curves for a firm.
