The graph below shows the market for builders with the marginal factor (resource) cost curve, the labor supply curve, and the marginal revenue product curve.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Builders,” and the following 10 numbers are indicated from left to right: 140, 210, 280, 320, 420, 520, 560, 640, 700, and 840. The vertical axis is labeled “Wage Rate, in U S dollars,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 28, 70, 91, 112, 124, 154, and 280. The three curves in the graph are labeled “Marginal Factor Cost,” “Supply,” and “Marginal Revenue Product.” The Marginal Factor Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at $28 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 140 comma $70, 210 comma $91, 280 comma $112, 320 comma $124, and 420 comma $154. The Marginal Factor Cost curve ends at wage rate $280, and just to the left of quantity 840. The Supply curve also begins on the vertical axis at $28 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with the following coordinates: 420 comma $91, 560 comma $112, 640 comma $124, and 840 comma $154. The Supply curve ends slightly above wage rate $154, and slightly to the right of quantity 840. The Marginal Revenue Product curve begins on the vertical axis at $280 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Marginal Factor Cost curve at 420 comma $154, passes through the point with coordinates 520 comma $124, then intersects the Supply curve at 560 comma $112, and passes through the point with coordinates 700 comma $70. The Marginal Revenue Product curve ends on the horizontal axis and to the right of quantity 840.\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250533.g01.png\" width=\"575\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) If the wage rate is $124, state whether there will be a shortage or a surplus of builders and calculate its size. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Identify the profit-maximizing number of builders that Cornel’s Construction will hire.

Explain using the labeling on the graph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) If the marginal product of builders increases, what will happen to the quantity of services provided by Cornel’s Construction? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume instead that Cornel’s Construction uses both labor and capital in providing its services. The marginal product of the last unit of labor hired is 15 projects per hour and the marginal product of the last unit of capital rented is 10 projects per hour; the hourly wage rate for labor is $150 and the hourly rental price for capital is $50. To minimize the cost of providing its current level of output, should Cornel’s Construction rent more capital, less capital, or the same amount of capital? Explain using marginal analysis.</p>\n"}]}]
