The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from left to right: 5, 11, 17, 24, 30, and 40. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 40, 44, 65, 78, 101, and 119. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $119, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 24 comma $119, 30 comma $101, and 40 comma $78. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 40, and between prices $44 and $65. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 24 comma $65, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 30 and 40, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 40. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $119, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It moves above and to the right of the Demand curve, and reaches its lowest point just above price $119 and just to the right of quantity 30. The Average Total Cost curve then turns to move upward and to the right, and ends to the right of quantity 40, above price $119, and below where the Demand curve begins on the vertical axis. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $65, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 17 comma $44, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $44 and between quantities 24 and 30, and then intersects the Demand curve at 40 comma $78. The Average Variable Cost curve ends almost directly below where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $101 and $119. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 11 comma $40, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 17 comma $44, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 24 comma $65. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Demand curve at 30 comma $101, and then intersects the Average Total Cost curve at its lowest point just to the right of quantity 30. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $119 and just to the left of quantity 40.\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217769.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">MemorEyes, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on a learning aid, making it the only producer of that learning aid. The graph above shows MemorEyes’ demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes MemorEyes’ profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does MemorEyes earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Calculate MemorEyes’ total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) At a price of $40, will MemorEyes continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume that at 30 units, the average total cost is $120. If the total rent paid by MemorEyes increases by $450, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that MemorEyes’ patent expires. Cognitz, a company with the capability to produce the same learning aid as MemorEyes, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than MemorEyes for the learning aid. MemorEyes is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match Cognitz’ price. Cognitz is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (MemorEyes and Cognitz) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents MemorEyes’ payoff and the second entry represents Cognitz’ payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
