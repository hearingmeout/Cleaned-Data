[{"id":"VH925897","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity, and the vertical axis is labeled Price. The horizontal axis is about twice as long as the vertical axis is high. There are four curves on the graph, which are labeled M C, A V C, A T C, and M R. The M C curve begins about one fourth of the way up and just to the right of the vertical axis. It steadily moves upward and to the right, and ends about three quarters of the way along the horizontal axis, near the top of the graph. The A V C curve begins about half way up and just to the right of the vertical axis. It moves downward and to the right, and reaches a minimum when it crosses the M C curve. It then begins to moves upward and to the right, and ends on the right side of the graph, well below and to the right of the M C curve. The A T C curve begins near the top and just to the right of the vertical axis. In a similar shape as the A V C curve, the A T C curve falls, reaches a minimum, and then rises. The A T C curve is always above the A V C curve, and the distance between the two curves gradually narrows as they move from left to right along the graph. The A T C curve reaches its minimum point when it crosses the M C curve. The A T C and M C curves cross each other above and to the right of where the A V C and M C curves cross each other. After reaching its minimum point, the A T C curve moves upward and to the right, until it ends on the right side of the graph, to the right of the M C curve and above the A V C curve. The M R curve is a horizontal line that begins about half way up the vertical axis and extends across the length of the graph. The M R line intersects the M C curve above and to the right of the intersection of the M C and A V C curves, and below and to the left of the intersection of the M C and A T C curves. Quantity Q sub 0, on the horizontal axis, is identified by a dashed vertical line that extends from the intersection of the M C and the A V C curves, and extends down to the horizontal axis. Quantity Q sub 1, on the horizontal axis, is identified by a dashed vertical line that extends from the intersection of the M R and M C curves, and extends down to the horizontal axis. Quantity Q sub 2, on the horizontal axis, is identified by a dashed vertical line that extends from the intersection of the M C and A T C curves, and extends down to the horizontal axis.\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH925897.g04.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the short-run cost and revenue curves for a perfectly competitive firm.
