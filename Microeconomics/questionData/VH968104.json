The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity, and the numbers 20 through 80, in increments of 20, are indicated with vertical grid lines extending up from each. The vertical axis is labeled Price, and the values $1.00 through $3.00, in increments of $0.50, are indicated with horizontal grid lines extending to the right from each. The three curves are labeled D equals M S B, M S C, and S equals M P C. Curve D equals M S B begins on the vertical axis at price $3.00 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the coordinates 20 comma $2.50, 40 comma $2.00, 60 comma $1.50, and 80 comma $1.00. It ends slightly to the right of quantity 80 and slightly below price $1.00. Curve M S C begins on the vertical axis at price $2.00 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects curve D equals M S B at the point with coordinates 20 comma $2.50, and passes through the coordinates 40 comma $3.00. It ends slightly to the left of quantity 60 and above price $3.00. Curve S equals M P C begins on the vertical axis at price $1.00 and moves upward and to the right in a straight line, parallel to Line M S C. It passes through the coordinates 20 comma $1.50, intersects curve D equals M S B at coordinates 40 comma $2.00, and then passes through the coordinates 60 comma $2.50 and 80 comma $3.00.
