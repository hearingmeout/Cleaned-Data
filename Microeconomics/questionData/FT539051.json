A value P is labeled about a third of the way up the vertical axis and a horizontal line is drawn at that level labeled demand. Two curves are also drawn that are concave up everywhere, decreasing on the left before reaching a minimum and increasing on the right. The first curve is labeled average total cost which has its minimum near the center of the graph above the demand line. The second is labeled marginal cost which has its minimum in the lower left of the graph and crosses the demand line twice, once to the left of the minimum and once to the right, and then after crossing the demand line on the right also crosses the average total cost curve near its minimum.\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/b4ef887bf21e57576aa9014a2ea85fd7/original.jpg\" width=\"345\">"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>Economic losses are incurred, and the firm will increase price until no losses are incurred.</p>","<p>Economic losses are incurred, and exit of firms from the market will cause prices to increase in the long run.</p>","<p>Economic profits are earned, and costs will increase until no profits are earned.</p>","<p>Economic profits are earned, and entry of firms into the market will cause prices to decrease in the long run.</p>","<p>Economic profits are earned, and neither exit nor entry of firms will occur in the long run.</p>"],"answer":0}]
