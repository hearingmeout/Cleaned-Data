A linear positively sloped curve labeled &quot;Supply&quot; start at point P W on the vertical axis. The point at which both the lines intersect is marked L. Two points K and J are marked on the supply curve while two points M and N are marked on the demand curve. K lie opposite P 1 on the vertical axis and opposite 100 on the horizontal axis. M lie opposite P 1 on the vertical axis and opposite 300 on the horizontal axis. J lie opposite P W on the vertical axis and opposite 50 on the horizontal axis.
