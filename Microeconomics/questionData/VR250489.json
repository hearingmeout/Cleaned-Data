The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0 through 200, in increments of 20, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost,” and the numbers 0 through 200, in increments of 20, are indicated. The four curves are labeled D, M R, M C, and A T C, which are plotted as follows. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at price 200 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 40 comma 160, 80 comma 120, and 120 comma 80. Curve D ends on the horizontal axis at quantity 200. Curve M R also begins on the vertical axis at price 200 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 40 comma 120, 60 comma 80, and 80 comma 40. Curve M R intersects the horizontal axis at quantity 100 and ends below the horizontal axis, and between quantities 100 and 120. Curve M C begins between price 60 and price 80, and to the left of quantity 20 and moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point slightly above price 40 and between quantities 20 and 40. From this point, curve M C turns to steeply move upward and to the right, intersects curve M R at coordinates 60 comma 80, and then intersects curve D at coordinates 80 comma 120. Curve M C ends just to the right of quantity 100 and just below price 180. Curve A T C begins just below price 200, and just to the left of quantity 60, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It passes through the coordinates 60 comma 180, begins to level out, and reaches its lowest point where it intersects curve M C at the approximate coordinates 90 comma 140.  From this point, curve A T C turns to move upward and to the right and ends just above price 180, and between quantities 140 and 160.\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR250489.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>R</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>) curves for one of many profit-maximizing firms operating in the short run in an industry in which there are no barriers to entry.
