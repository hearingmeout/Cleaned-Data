[{"id":"VR188570","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<div><div class=\"stimulus_reference\"><div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the graph of four curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity” and the vertical axis is labeled “Price comma Cost.” The quantities Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, and Q sub 4 are indicated from left to right on the horizontal axis. Q sub 1 is located about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. The distance from Q sub 2 to Q sub 1 is about one fourth of the distance from Q sub 1 to the origin. The distance from Q sub 3 to Q sub 2 is slightly greater than the distance from Q sub 2 to Q sub 1. The distance from Q sub 4 to Q sub 3 is about the same as the distance from Q sub 3 to Q sub 1. The prices P sub 1, P sub 2, P sub 3, P sub 4, and P sub 5 are indicated from bottom to top on the vertical axis. P sub 1 is located slightly above the origin. P sub 5 is located about halfway up the vertical axis. The distance from P sub 2 to P sub 1 is about one third of the distance from P sub 5 to P sub 1. P sub 3 is located slightly above P sub 2. P sub 4 lies about halfway between P sub 5 and P sub 3, but slightly closer to P sub 5. The four curves are labeled D for demand, M R for marginal revenue, M C for marginal cost, and A T C for average total cost. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at a point high above P sub 5, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 5, Q sub 2 comma P sub 4, Q sub 3 comma P sub 3, and Q sub 4 comma P sub 1. Curve D ends just above the horizontal axis, and slightly to the right of Q sub 4. Curve M R begins on the vertical axis at the same point as curve D, and moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2, and ends on the horizontal axis at Q sub 2. Curve M C begins between P sub 3 and P sub 4, just over halfway between the vertical axis and Q sub 1. It moves downward and to the right and intersects curve M R at the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2. Curve M C continues downward and to the right, begins to level out, passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 1, and reaches its lowest point just above the horizontal axis, between Q sub 3 and Q sub 4. From this point, curve M C moves gradually upward and to the right, intersects curve D at the point with coordinates Q sub 4 comma P sub 1, and continues for a short distance until it ends slightly to the right of Q sub 4 and slightly above P sub 1. Curve A T C begins above P sub 5, and slightly less than halfway between the vertical axis and Q sub 1. It moves downward and to the right, steeply at first and then more slowly, and intersects curve D at a point to the left of Q sub 1 and above P sub 5. Curve A T C continues on a trajectory between curves M R and D, passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 4, continues to level out, and then intersects curve D for a second time at the point with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. Curve A T C continues to move downward and to the right and ends to the right of Q sub 4, between P sub 2 and P sub 3.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR188570.g04.png\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph provided shows the demand (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">D</mi></math></span></span>), marginal revenue (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M R\"><math alttext=\"M R\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>MR</mi></math></span></span>), marginal cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M C\"><math alttext=\"M C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>MC</mi></math></span></span>), and average total cost (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T C\"><math alttext=\"A T C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>ATC</mi></math></span></span>) curves for a monopolist.
