Five points R, S, T, U, and V are labeled on the vertical axis from top to bottom, and four points Q sub 1 through 4 are labeled on the horizontal axis from left to right. Two lines are plotted starting on the vertical axis above R and decreasing linearly to the right, with the upper line labeled demand and the lower line labeled marginal revenue. A curve labeled average total cost is plotted that is concave up everywhere, decreasing on the left before reaching a minimum between the two lines and increasing to the right. A second curve labeled marginal cost is plotted that is increasing and concave up, starting in the lower left of the graph and increasing through the marginal revenue line, then the average total cost curve, then the demand line. Six points are labeled on the graph. Four of them, I, J, K, and M, lie on the demand line. Point I is at coordinates Q sub 1 and R, Point J is at coordinates Q sub 2 and S, Point K is at coordinates Q sub 3 and T which is also where the marginal cost curve crosses the demand line, and point M is at coordinates Q sub 4 and U which is also where the average total cost curve crosses the demand line. The fifth point, L, lies on the average total cost curve just to the left of its minimum and has coordinates Q sub 1 and U. The sixth point, N, has coordinates Q sub 1 and V and is at the point where the marginal revenue line and the marginal cost curve intersect.\" height=\"273\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/9e0d79296c7494ce9e36eab887a96a44/original.jpg\" width=\"651\"></p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0R</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>1</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0S</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>2</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0T</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>3</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0U</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>1</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Price</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Output</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0U</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Q<sub>4</sub></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":1}]
