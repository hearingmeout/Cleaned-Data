The horizontal axis is labeled, “Quantity in units,” and There are three quantities indicated on the axis from left to right, Q sub 1, Q sub 2, and Q sub 3. The vertical axis is labeled, “Price,” and there are three prices indicated on the axis from bottom to top, P sub 1 , P sub 2, P sub 3. The first line is labeled Demand, and begins at the top of the vertical axis. The line moves downward and to the right, and passes through the points Q sub 1 comma P sub 3, Q sub 2 comma P sub 2, and Q sub 3 comma P sub 1. The line ends just above the horizontal axis. The second line is labeled Supply, and begins in the lower part of the vertical axis. The line moves upward and to the right, and passes through the points Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, Q sub 2 comma P sub 2, and Q sub 3 comma P sub The line ends far to the right of the vertical axis. There are three horizontal dashed lines on the plane parallel to the X-axis. The first horizontal dashed line starts from the Y-axis at P sub 1 and moves to the right, it passes through the Supply line at point Q sub 1 and P sub 1 and ends at the Demand line at point Q sub 3 and P sub 1. The second horizontal dashed line starts from the Y-axis at P sub 2 and moves to the right and ends at the intersection point of the Demand and Supply lines at point Q sub 2 and P sub 2. The third horizontal dashed line starts from the Y-axis at P sub 3 and moves to the right, it passes through the Demand line at point Q sub 1 and P sub 3 and ends at the Supply line at point Q sub 3 and P sub 3.\n\nThere are three vertical dashed lines on the plane parallel to the Y-axis. The first vertical dashed line starts from the X-axis at Q sub 1 and moves up till it passes through the Supply line at point Q sub 1 and P sub 1 and ends at the Demand line at point Q sub 1 and P sub 3. The second vertical dashed line starts from the X-axis at Q sub 2 and moves up till ends at the intersection point of the Demand and Supply lines at point Q sub 2 and P sub 2. The third vertical dashed line starts from the X-axis at Q sub 3 and moves up till it passes through the Demand line at point Q sub 3 and P sub 1 and ends at the Supply line at point Q sub 3 and P sub 3.\n\nThere are six letters on the graph that indicate enclosed. Letter A indicates the area of the triangle below the Demand line and above the third horizontal line. Letter B indicates the area of the rectangle bound by the Y-axis, the third horizontal dashed line, the second horizontal dashed line, and the first vertical line. Letter C indicates the area of the rectangle bound by the Y-axis, the second horizontal dashed line, the first horizontal dashed line, and the first vertical line. Letter D indicates the area of the triangle above the Supply line and below the first horizontal line. Letter E indicates the area of the triangle below the Demand line, above the second horizontal dashed line, and to the right of first vertical dashed line. Letter F indicates the area of the triangle above the Supply line, below the second horizontal dashed line, and the right of first vertical dashed line.\n\" height=\"389\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/c8b7d425-b26f-47f3-8b66-3029cc84f6e8.png\" width=\"416\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Consumer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Producer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Deadweight Loss</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">B + E</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">C + F</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A + B</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Consumer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Producer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Deadweight Loss</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A + B</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">C + D</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">E + F</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Consumer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Producer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Deadweight Loss</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">C + D + F</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">E</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Consumer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Producer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Deadweight Loss</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A + B + E</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">C + D + F</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Consumer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Producer Surplus</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"text-center\" scope=\"col\">Deadweight Loss</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">B + C + D</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">E + F</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n"],"answer":"0"}]
