The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the following 7 numbers are indicated from left to right: 12, 26, 39, 55, 72, 96, and 106. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost, in U S dollars,” and the following 6 numbers are indicated from bottom to top: 10, 11, 16, 20, 26, and 30. The five curves in the graph are labeled “Demand,” “Marginal Revenue,” “Average Total Cost,” “Average Variable Cost,” and “Marginal Cost.” The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and above price $30, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 55 comma $30, 72 comma $26, 96 comma $20, and 106 comma $16. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 106, and between prices $11 and $16. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 55 comma $16, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 72 and 96, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 96. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $30, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It intersects the Demand curve above price $30, and touches the Marginal Revenue curve between prices $26 and $30 before it begins to move downward and to the right more slowly. The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point just above price $20 and between quantities 55 and 72. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve again between quantities 72 and 96. The Average Total Cost curve ends to the right of quantity 106, and just above price $30. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $16, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 39 comma $11, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $11 and between quantities 55 and 72, and then intersects the Demand curve at 96 comma $20. The Average Variable Cost curve ends almost directly below where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $26 and $30. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 26 comma $10, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 39 comma $11, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 55 comma $16. The Marginal Cost curve continues to steeply move upward and intersects the Average Total Cost curve at its lowest point between quantities 55 and 72, and then intersects the Demand curve at 72 comma $26. The Marginal Cost curve ends high above price $30 and just to the left of quantity 96.\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217770.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">NanoWare, a profit-maximizing firm, has a patent on software, making it the only producer of that software. The graph above shows NanoWare’s demand, marginal revenue, average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost curves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Identify the quantity that maximizes NanoWare’s profit. Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) At the quantity identified in part (a), does NanoWare earn a positive economic profit, a negative economic profit, or zero economic profit? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Calculate NanoWare’s total revenue if the firm produces the allocatively efficient quantity. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) At a price of $26, will NanoWare continue to produce or will it shut down in the short run? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) Assume that at 72 units, the average total cost is $22. If the total advertising costs paid by NanoWare increase by $216, calculate the firm’s new average total cost at that output. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assume that NanoWare’s patent expires. HotCode, a company with the capability to produce the same software as NanoWare, intends to enter the market and charge a lower price than NanoWare for the software. NanoWare is considering whether to maintain its price or to lower its price to match HotCode’s price. HotCode is considering whether or not to advertise its entry into the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The matrix below shows the payoffs for each combination of strategies, and both players (NanoWare and HotCode) have complete information. The first entry in each cell represents NanoWare’s payoff and the second entry represents HotCode’s payoff. Each player independently and simultaneously chooses its strategy.
