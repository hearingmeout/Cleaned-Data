A correctly labeled diagram must have all axes and curves clearly labeled and must show directional changes.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img alt=\"A graph in the first quadrant is shown with price slash cost on the vertical axis and output on the horizontal axis. The values P sub 1 through sub 5 are labeled on the vertical axis from bottom to top, and the values Q sub 1 through Q sub 5 are labeled on the horizontal axis from left to right. Each value has a dashed reference line drawn from it. Two lines are plotted starting from the top of the vertical axis above P sub 5 and decrease linearly, with the top line labeled demand ending on the horizontal axis to the right of Q sub 5 and the bottom line crossing the horizontal axis at Q sub 3. Two curves are plotted that are concave up everywhere, decreasing on the left before reaching a minimum an increasing on the right. The first curve is labeled average total cost and has its minimum in the center of the graph between the demand and marginal revenue lines. The second curve is labeled marginal cost and has its minimum in the lower left of the graph. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/45a55ff465cf4b8569d9bcd65b38777c/original.jpg\" />\n<p>The diagram above shows the cost and revenue curves for a monopoly.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>How does a monopolist determine its profit-maximizing level of output and price?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Using the information in the graph, identify each of the following for the monopolist.</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The profit-maximizing level of output and price</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The line segment of the demand curve that is elastic</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Suppose that the industry depicted in the graph became perfectly competitive without changing the demand or cost curves.
