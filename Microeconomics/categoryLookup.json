Define opportunity cost. b. Explain the opportunity costs associated with choices. c. Calculate the opportunity costs associated with choices.","309584":"CBA-1.A.1: Rational agents consider opportunity costs, whether implicit or explicit, when calculating the total economic costs of any decision.","309585":"CBA-1.A.2: Total benefits form the metric \"utility\" for consumers and total revenue for firms.","309586":"CBA-1.B: a. Explain a decision by comparing total benefits and total costs (using a table or a graph when appropriate). b. Calculate total benefits and total costs (using a table or graph when appropriate).","309587":"CBA-1.B.1: Total net benefits, the difference between total benefits and total costs, are maximized at the optimal choice.","309588":"CBA-1.B.2: Some decisions permit rational agents to look at only marginal benefit and marginal cost. Other decisions cannot be broken down into increments in this way and must be evaluated by looking at total benefits and total costs.","309589":"CBA-2: To determine the optimal level at which to pursue an activity whose total benefits exceed total cost, rational economic agents compare marginal benefits and marginal costs.","309590":"CBA-2.A: a.

Define marginal analysis and related terms. b. Explain a decision using marginal analysis (using a table or a graph when appropriate).","309596":"CBA-2.B.1: Marginal analysis involves comparing the additional benefit of increasing a given activity with the additional cost. Comparing marginal benefit (MB) with marginal cost (MC) helps individuals (firms) decide whether to increase, decrease, or maintain their consumption (production) levels.","309597":"CBA-2.B.2: The optimal quantity at any point in time does not depend on fixed costs (sunk costs) or fixed benefits that have already been determined by past choices.","309598":"CBA-2.B.3: The optimal quantity is achieved when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost or where total benefit is maximized.","309599":"CBA-2.C: a.

Calculate a firm's profit or loss.","309600":"CBA-2.C.1: Firms respond to economic profit (loss) rather than accounting profit.","309601":"CBA-2.C.2: Accounting profit fails to account for implicit costs (such as cost of financial capital, compensation for risk, or an entrepreneur's time) which if fully compensated result in normal profit.","309602":"CBA-2.D: a.

How to produce those goods and services? And who consumes those goods and services?","309611":"MKT-1.B.2: Resource allocation is significantly influenced by the economic system adopted by society, such as command economy, market economy, or mixed economy.
