A line labeled, D sub L, begins high up on the vertical axis and moves down and to the right ending above the horizontal axis. A curve labeled, L A T C, begins to the right of the vertical axis and slightly above D sub L.  L A T C curves down and to the right and is tangent to D sub L line. Shortly after the tangency point,  L A T C curves away from horizontal axis, and then continues to move  up and to the right.\"></p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for a correctly labeled graph showing a long-run average total cost curve tangent to a downward-sloping demand curve.</p></li></ul>"]}]
