[{"id":"FT584161_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Part A","stimulusHtml":"<p>The student should show a market supply curve that includes only private costs of production. For a given market demand curve, there will be an equilibrium price and quantity of output. There should be a second supply curve that incorporates all costs of production, including the external costs. The socially optimum level of output is found at the intersection of the market demand and the supply curve that incorporates all costs, both private and external. With the same market demand curve, at the social optimum, the equilibrium price should be higher and the equilibrium quantity lower. In essence, the unregulated private market will produce too much output at too low a unit price.</p><p>To achieve the socially optimum level of output the government could introduce a unit tax on output. If properly chosen, this tax could raise the supply curve with only private costs to intersect at the socially optimum output level. Alternatively, quantity controls or pollution permits could be used to correct the overproduction.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/6574a1419ddf0eb8a4a04a3790c4c0fb/original.jpg?Signature=jagOmualwTy%2B1i%2FxAOyOPsoPD60%3D&amp;Expires=1628352841&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKVSRXLJUC&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFcaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDk4WanMP78NlsKU6LkSQXrX5qfTAtiGtAy6QcaI%2BlKDgIgdA8k7mROWLQoXUILcMZhj5WXNm6FTeZ/kBsGzDC46f4q%2BgMIcBACGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDGMIul1k6m13dF2bPirXA25OnbzP1gFS%2Bgr/XduGMeDanTdYeQb7l4QWuIzOs/7Fpd8SDweDLihcthKKl0ByTsub3KKa4jkCRH/zw/Wa0xDrNL5uzHvSkTVt%2BVJE%2Bo4ylQAU0GXPEpPLfH0i3/6EdJxPGcFu6a07sLzFlND1sZadUd4xIEXRp6TNYnyTZkL2qkC0Yjdl%2BvRQHDtzMyHcv/XKVtq5xBlDXrWATFqzIPJa%2BYpu2QDxIk4P%2BC3JjCE7ftlgEMiq7hy5WoIryL9qTu0aNq8ExLM6oYebpx7uhid4zvAFsbzoEY15uVnb11vNy6GeHQuzEh2SXgnFGDzU/pACCDDe%2B684pFaKSm/2%2BGcZKE06TMsbUL/zpBOOB0fmPt9vinmFyVbafbMv36wIdNWX8F2LhOCoBxrD7EOdDrpdtqYfYV6T2Ljc4Na3hZFMnFG6mOZCTLLVtgdrzzoBMyECzfk3q4/iC%2BWdzhwHZ1CC6Cyfw06OfwcCNE4%2Brb/lrK6qxrNq9f2zQ9Cir9PepAuDLGXuqvM3AOMLRF%2BDFldOQR16JBzhVzP7C/eRzjUl9DsFUu9Gw1to6UTmjabx2MOvKwtKui0o/jg3VeZdjzJxpWuK3yDhHB0ciTQkk7VATyS%2BBJLZATC127iIBjqlAR%2Bax2Ke0JukwPEogZG3/if97l%2BbRQd5nWksKaVS/vDVSCAEjgPiy6iEa78S9T2s3jLDHQVSFOQ2pJgsl/%2BVeTHUiYSi2BuKxIxyhG4cAMxmrovQxZpFlKOMOAiXmAe1Rb71jwg3c%2BwY5cB76rLUvMzwXQHPmSo1ZCmon40LtKUxMMS9KXMVFz72jwQNbhfPjUcdNfOjuWYWZ9j8%2BcVKXAr048mIyA%3D%3D\" width=\"400\" maxwidth=\"400\" title=\"\" alt=\"A graph depicts quantity versus price.
