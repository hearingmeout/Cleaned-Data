There are two point on the horizontal axis labeled, from left to right, Q M and Q A. There is one point on the vertical axis labeled P M. There are four lines on the group, two straight line and two curves lines. One straight line labeled D, representing demand, slopes downward from left to right, starting from an unlabeled point above P M on the vertical axis. The second straight line labeled M R, representing marginal revenue, begins at the same point on the vertical axis, and moves downward below the demand line with a steeper slope, intersecting the horizontal axis at a point to the right of Q A. One curved line is labeled A T C, representing average total cost, and lies above the demand line everywhere. The A T C curve starts near the vertical axis toward the top of the graph, curves down and then curves up. The second curved line is labeled M C, representing marginal cost. The M C curve starts near the vertical axis toward the bottom of the graph and curves down, then curves upward to pass through lines M R an D. The M C curve intersects line M R at a point with coordinates Q M and an unlabeled point on the vertical axis below P M but above the coordinate of the M R intersection. The MC curve passes through the minimum point of the ATC curve and moves up. There is a vertical dotted line that starts from the point Q M going through the intersection of the M C and M R lines and crossing the D line at the coordinates P M and Q M and ending at a point on the downward sloping portion of the A T C curve above the demand line. There is also a shaded rectangle in the top left portion of the graph. The bottom line of the shaded rectangle begins at P M and horizontally runs and ends at the intersection of the demand line and the vertical dotted li ne from Q M. The top line of the shaded rectangle starts from a point above P M on the vertical axis and runs to the right to complete the box at the intersection of the vertical dotted line and the A T C curve. \"></p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for shading the area of the lump-sum subsidy.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the profit-maximizing quantity remains the same because marginal cost does not shift, or marginal revenue does not shift, or the subsidy <strong>only</strong> affects fixed cost, total cost, or total revenue.</p></li></ul>"]},{"id":"FT539575-22_rubric_category_2","type":"custom","title":"Part C","stimulusHtml":"<p><strong>2 Points</strong></p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the per-unit subsidy increases the profit-maximizing quantity because marginal cost decreases or marginal revenue increases.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the price paid by consumers decreases.</p></li></ul>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points"],"values":[0,1,2],"maxScores":[2,2,2],"descriptions":["<p>The student earns none of the following points:</p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the per-unit subsidy increases the profit-maximizing quantity because marginal cost decreases or marginal revenue increases.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the price paid by consumers decreases.</p></li></ul>","<p>The student earns one of the following points:</p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the per-unit subsidy increases the profit-maximizing quantity because marginal cost decreases or marginal revenue increases.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the price paid by consumers decreases.</p></li></ul>","<p>The student earns all of the following points:</p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the per-unit subsidy increases the profit-maximizing quantity because marginal cost decreases or marginal revenue increases.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for stating that the price paid by consumers decreases.</p></li></ul>"]},{"id":"FT539575-22_rubric_category_3","type":"custom","title":"Part D","stimulusHtml":"<p>One point is earned for stating that a <strong>per-unit</strong> subsidy increases consumer surplus because the per-unit subsidy results in a <strong>lower price</strong> to consumers.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point"],"values":[0,1],"maxScores":[1,1],"descriptions":["<p>The student earns none of the following points:</p><p>One point is earned for stating that a <strong>per-unit</strong> subsidy increases consumer surplus because the per-unit subsidy results in a <strong>lower price</strong> to consumers.</p>","<p>The student earns all of the following points:</p><p>One point is earned for stating that a <strong>per-unit</strong> subsidy increases consumer surplus because the per-unit subsidy results in a <strong>lower price</strong> to consumers.</p>"]}]
