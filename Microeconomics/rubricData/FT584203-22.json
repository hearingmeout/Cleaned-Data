The graph plots two concave up curves and two lines with negative slopes. The first line, D declines from a point on the vertical axis and culminates above the horizontal axis. The second line, M R, starts from the same point on the vertical axis as line D, declines steeply toward the left, intersects the horizontal axis, and culminates below it. The first curve, A T C, begins from a point between the lines D and M R, declines, then rises to intersect line D roughly at its midpoint. It continues to rise to a price value slightly higher than its starting point. The second curve, M C, begins at a price value lower than the first curve. It initially declines and then rises sharply, to first intersect the line M R, then the curve A T C, and finally the line D. The curve culminates at a price value slightly higher than the first curve, at a point toward its left. A vertical dashed line is drawn from a point, Q subscript 1, on the horizontal axis to the point of intersection of the curve M C and the line M R. It extends upward, intersecting the curve A T C. A horizontal dashed line is drawn from the vertical axis to this point. It further extends upward to a point on line D, with a price value, P subscript 1. Another horizontal dashed line is drawn from the vertical axis to this point. A shaded rectangular region labeled Profit, is enclosed between the two horizontal dashed lines, the vertical axis, and the vertical dashed line Q subscript 1. A triangular region above this shaded area is labeled Consumer surplus. It is enclosed by the vertical axis, line D, and the horizontal dashed line at P subscript 1. A shaded area to the right of the rectangular region is labeled Deadweight loss.
