Both graphs have quantity on the horizontal axis and prize on the vertical axis. In the graph on the left two values, P 1 and P 2 are shown on the vertical axis with P 1 greater than P 2, and dashed horizontal reference lines are drawn for each value. An arrow points down from P 1 to P 2. Uppercase Q 2 and Q 1 are shown on the horizontal axis with Q 1 greater than Q 2, and dashed vertical reference lines are drawn for each value. An arrow points to the left from Q 1 to Q 2. Two parallel lines are plotted on the graph, both straight and with negative slopes. The upper line is labeled uppercase D 1 and passes through the intersection of the reference lines for P 1 and uppercase Q 1. The lower line is labeled uppercase D 2 and passes through the intersection of the reference lines for P 2 and uppercase Q 2. A third line labeled S with a positive slop is also plotted. Line S passes through both the intersection of the reference lines P 1 and uppercase Q 1 and the intersection of the reference lines P 2 and uppercase Q 2. In the graph on the right two values, P 1 and P 2 are shown on the vertical axis with P 1 greater than P 2 and dashed horizontal reference lines are drawn for each value. The square area inside of P 1 and P 2 is shaded a light grey and labeled Loss. Lower case q 2 and q 1 are shown on the horizontal axis with q 1 greater than q 2 and dashed vertical reference lines are drawn for each value. An arrow points to the left from q 1 to q 2. A solid line is plotted on the graph at P 1 with the values d 1 equals M R 1 at the right end of the line. The dashed reference line for P 2 runs parallel to the solid line with the value d 2 equals M R 2. There are two curved lines on the graph, both with decreasing slopes.
