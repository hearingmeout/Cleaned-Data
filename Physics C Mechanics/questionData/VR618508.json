The rock and the astronaut are at rest relative to a nearby spaceship. The mass of the rock is greater than the mass of the astronaut and the mass of the cord is negligible. Which of the following best describes and explains the behavior of the center of mass of the astronaut-cord-rock system relative the spaceship as the astronaut pulls on the cord?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR618508_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The center of mass shifts to the right because the astronaut moves to the right and the rock remains stationary.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The center of mass shifts to the right because the force on the astronaut is greater than the force on the rock due to their different masses.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The center of mass does not move because the astronaut and the rock each move the same distance towards the original location of the center of mass.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The center of mass does not move because the astronaut will move a larger distance to the right than the rock moves to the left.</p>"],"answer":3}]
