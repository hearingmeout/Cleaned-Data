A spring of force constant 40 N/m is held horizontal over a horizontal air track, with one end attached to the air track. A light string is attached to the other end of the spring and connects it to a glider of mass <em>m</em> . The glider is pulled to stretch the spring an amount <em>x</em> from equilibrium and then released. Before reaching the photogate, the glider attains its maximum speed and the string becomes slack. The photogate measures the time <em>t</em> that it takes the small block on top of the glider to pass through. Information about the distance <em>x</em> and the speed <em>v</em> of the glider as it passes through the photogate are given below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with five columns.
