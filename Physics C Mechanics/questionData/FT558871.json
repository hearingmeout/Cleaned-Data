Cart <em>A </em>is approaching cart <em>B</em>, which is at rest, as shown in Figure 1 above. Attached to cart <em>B </em>is a spring that is initially compressed. At the moment cart A collides with cart <em>B</em>, the spring is released and pushes on cart <em>A</em>, as shown in Figure 2 above. Which of the following correctly states what happens to the kinetic energy and the momentum of the two-cart system as a result of the collision compared to those quantities before the collision?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>Kinetic energy: Increases; Magnitude of Momentum: Decreases</p>","<p>Kinetic energy: Increases; Magnitude of Momentum: Stays the same</p>","<p>Kinetic energy: Increases; Magnitude of Momentum: Increases</p>","<p>Kinetic energy: Stays the same; Magnitude of Momentum: Decreases</p>","<p>Kinetic energy: Stays the same; Magnitude of Momentum: Stays the same</p>"],"answer":0}]
