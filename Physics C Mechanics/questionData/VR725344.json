The hill’s surface is in the shape of a parabola. If the ball is rolled down the hill, is the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x\"><math alttext=\"x\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>x</mi></math></span></span>-component of its motion an example of simple harmonic motion? What reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR725344_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. The initial push on the ball displaces it from the equilibrium position.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. The potential energy of the ball-Earth system is a quadratic function of position, resulting in a linear restoring force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. There is no equilibrium position for the ball.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. The net force on the ball is in the same direction as the ball’s displacement from equilibrium.</p>"],"answer":3}]
