The objects all have the same linear speed initially. The objects are a hollow cylinder, a solid cylinder, a solid sphere, and a hollow sphere. The objects to go up the arc and exit the arc going in the opposite direction they entered without falling off the arc. Now, several trials are run for each object. For each trial, the initial speed of the object is reduced until the object does not make it through the full arc. The speed needed for each object to just make it through the arc is recorded. Which of the following correctly lists the objects in order from fastest to slowest speed needed to make it through the arc?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH904537_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Hollow cylinder, hollow sphere, solid cylinder, solid sphere</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Hollow cylinder, solid sphere, solid cylinder, hollow sphere</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Solid sphere, solid cylinder, hollow sphere, hollow cylinder</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Solid sphere, hollow sphere, solid cylinder, hollow cylinder</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Hollow sphere, solid cylinder, hollow cylinder, solid sphere</p>"],"answer":2}]
