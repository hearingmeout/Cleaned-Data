The dart makes an angle labeled 30 degrees with a horizontal line. A dashed arc indicates the path of the dart as a parabola starting at 30 degrees and going up and to the right and becoming horizontal at the block There is a dashed drawing of the string and block hanging from the upper horizontal surface at an angle labeled theta to the right of its original, vertical position. \n\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/f9bb26cb5e98557871af3e2f028c376c/original.png\" width=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p>A small dart of mass 0.020 kg is launched at an angle of 30° above the horizontal with an initial speed of 10 m/s. At the moment it reaches the highest point in its path and is moving horizontally, it collides with and sticks to a wooden block of mass 0.10 kg that is suspended at the end of a massless string. The center of mass of the block is 1.2 m below the pivot point of the string. The block and dart then swing up until the string makes an angle <em>θ</em> with the vertical, as shown above.
