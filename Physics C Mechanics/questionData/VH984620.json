Figure 2 shows a free-body diagram for the block as it moves up the incline, where <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"N\"><math alttext=\"N\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the normal force, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"lowercase f\"><math alttext=\"lowercase f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the force of friction, and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"W\"><math alttext=\"W\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>W</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the force of Earth’s gravity. Figure 3 shows a free-body diagram for the block as it moves down the incline. Based on these figures, which of the following is a correct statement?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH984620_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since friction changes direction as the block’s motion changes direction, friction is a conservative force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since friction is always against the motion of the block, the total work done by friction is zero.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since the normal force is always perpendicular to the motion, the normal force is a conservative force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since a component of gravity is always directed toward the original position of the block, gravity is a conservative force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since gravity is with the motion of the block up the incline and also with the motion of the block down the incline, gravity is a nonconservative force.</p>"],"answer":3}]
