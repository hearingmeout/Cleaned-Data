The first figure is labeled “Data for Single Spring,” and shows a scatterplot in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled O.

The data points begin in the lower left portion of the scatter plot and trend nearly linearly upward and to the right. The second figure is labeled “Two-Spring Arrangement” and shows two vertical identical springs that are placed side by side and are attached at the top to the same ceiling.
