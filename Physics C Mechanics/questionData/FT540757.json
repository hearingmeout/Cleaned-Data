Both tracks are frictionless, and both blocks make a smooth transition onto the rough horizontal surfaces. Block 1 comes to rest at a horizontal distance <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> from the bottom of the track. Which of the following best describes and explains the horizontal distance <em>d</em><sub>2</sub> that block 2 travels before coming to rest?</p>","choicesHtml":["<em>d<sub>2</sub> &lt; d</em><sub>1</sub>, because block 2 reaches its maximum speed later than block 1","<em>d<sub>2</sub> &lt; d<sub>1</sub></em>, because block 2 has a lower maximum speed later than block 1","<em>d2 = d1</em>, because the blocks have the same mass","<em>d2 = d1</em>, because the blocks start at the same height","<em>d2 &gt; d1,</em> because the track for block 2 is shorter"],"answer":2}]
