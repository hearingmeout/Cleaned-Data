The other end of the rod can pivot freely about an axle with negligible friction. Initially, the rod and launcher, with a projectile inside, are all at rest. The projectile is then launched to the right, causing the rod and launcher to recoil in the clockwise direction. Immediately after the projectile is launched, which of the following pairs of statements is true regarding both the angular momenta of the rod-launcher system and the projectile, and the kinetic energies of the road-launcher system and the projectile? Angular momentum is to be taken about the axle.</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR715705_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular momenta must be equal in magnitude.
