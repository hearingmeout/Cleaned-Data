A block of mass 0.30 kg is placed on a frictionless table and is attached to one end of a horizontal spring of spring constant <em>k</em>, as shown above. The other end of the spring is attached to a fixed wall. The block is set into oscillatory motion by stretching the spring and releasing the block from rest at time <em>t</em> = 0. A motion detector is used to record the position of the block as it oscillates. The resulting graph of velocity <em>v</em> versus time <em>t</em> is shown below. The positive direction for all quantities is to the right.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A sinusoidal curve is plotted on the xy plane to plot the relationship between velocity and time. The y axis is labeled \" height=\"198\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/58720fcca4e33b0ed415f595d3ff7956/original.png\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>a.

Given that the equilibrium position is at <em>x</em> = 0 , determine the equation for <em>x</em>(<em>t</em>), including numerical values for all constants.</p>\n\n<p>c. Calculate the value of <em>k</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Experiment 2</strong>. The block and spring arrangement is now placed on a rough surface, as shown below. The block is displaced so that the spring is <strong>compressed</strong> a distance <em>d</em> and released from rest.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A diagram shows a spring labeled positioned horizontally attached to a block of mass.
