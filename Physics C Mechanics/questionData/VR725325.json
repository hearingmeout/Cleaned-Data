A spring is attached to a wall near the bottom of the ramp and is parallel to the ramp surface. The cart is released from rest, rolls down the ramp, compresses the spring, reverses direction, and is then launched back up the ramp by the spring. The cart returns to its initial position, and the motion repeats. Although the cart’s motion is periodic, it is not simple harmonic motion. Which of the following provides reasoning for the claim that the cart does not undergo simple harmonic motion?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR725325_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is no equilibrium position where the net force on the cart is zero.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is an equilibrium position, but the spring is not at its relaxed length when the cart is in equilibrium.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is an equilibrium position, but there is no restoring force toward equilibrium when the cart is not in contact with the spring.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is an equilibrium position and a restoring force in both directions from equilibrium, but the restoring force is not proportional to the cart’s displacement from equilibrium.</p>"],"answer":3}]
