How would the angular momentum of the sphere at the bottom of the plane change if the coefficient of static friction between the sphere and the plane were increased?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH907513_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It would decrease because the force of friction would be greater.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It would decrease because the net torque would be larger.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It would increase because the angular acceleration would increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It would increase because the linear acceleration would increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It would remain the same because the net torque&nbsp;would remain the same.</p>\n"],"answer":4}]
