The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the values, from left to right, t sub 0, t sub A, t sub B, t sub C, and t sub D are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Velocity,” and the value 0 is indicated at the origin where the two axes intersect. The wave begins at the origin, moves upward and to the right and reaches its first crest located to the left of t sub 0. Then it moves downward to the right and passes the first data point, which is located above the horizontal axis at t sub 0. The curve continues downward and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis, and then reaches the second data point, which also represents the trough and is located below the horizontal axis at t sub A. The curve then moves upward and to the right and reaches the third data point, which lies on the horizontal axis at t sub B. The curve continues upward and to the right, reaches the fourth data point, which is located above the horizontal axis at t sub C, and continues upward to the second crest. The curve then moves downward and to the right and reaches the fifth data point, which is located slightly above the horizontal axis at t sub D. The curve then continues downward and to the right, crosses the horizontal axis, and ends below the horizontal axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR725829.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An object is oscillating in simple harmonic motion.
