The vertical axis is labeled g. Four equally spaced horizontal grid lines are drawn along the vertical axis. The graph consists of one solid line segment, one dashed line segment, and one solid curve. The solid line segment begins at the origin, and moves horizontally to the right until it reaches uppercase R sub 0. The dashed line segment begins where the solid line segment ends, and moves vertically upward until it ends at the fourth horizontal grid line above R sub 0. The curve begins where the dashed segment ends, and moves downward and to the right while becoming less steep.
