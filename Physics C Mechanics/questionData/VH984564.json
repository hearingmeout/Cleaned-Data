The student attaches a hanger to a spring, places weights on the hanger, pulls the hanger down, releases it from rest, and measures the corresponding period of oscillation for the hanger. However, during data entry, the student neglects to add the mass of the hanger to the values of the attached masses for the spring. The student constructs a graph of the data to determine if the data agrees with the equation <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"T equals 2 pi times the square root of the fraction m over k\"><math alttext=\"T equals 2 pi times the square root of the fraction m over k\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><msqrt><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msqrt></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>,where <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"k\"><math alttext=\"k\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> equals the elastic constant of spring.
