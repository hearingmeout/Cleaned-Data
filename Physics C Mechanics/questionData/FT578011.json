The horizontal axis is labeled 'Time, in seconds,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled &quot;Velocity, in meters per second,&quot; and the numbers negative 8 through 8, in increments of 2, are indicated. The curve is composed of five connected straight line segments, which are labeled A through E, and listed as follows. After the first line segment, each line segment begins where the previous segment ends. Line segment A begins at the point with coordinates 0 comma 0, and extends downward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 3 comma negative 6. Line segment B begins at the point with coordinates 3 comma negative 6, and extends horizontally to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 5 comma negative 6. Line segment C begins at the point with coordinates 5 comma negative 6, and extends upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 6.5 comma 0. Line segment D begins at the point with coordinates 6.5 comma 0, and extends horizontally to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 8 comma 0.
