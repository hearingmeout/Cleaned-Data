The first graph has a horizontal axis labeled Time, in seconds, and the numbers 0 through 6, in increments of 3, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled, Position, in centimeters, and the numbers negative 3 through 3, in increments of 1 are indicated. The shape of the graph is sinusoidal. The data from the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The graph begins at a point with coordinates 0 second comma 0 centimeters, and then moves steadily upward and to the right, reaching a maximum at the point 1 second comma 3 centimeters. It then curves downward and moves steadily downward and to the right reaching a minimum at the point 3 seconds comma negative 3 centimeters. It then curves upward and moves steadily upward and to the right, to a maximum at 5 seconds, 3 centimeters. It then curves downward and moves steadily downward and to the right, reaching a minimum at 7 seconds comma negative 3 centimeters. It curves upward and moves steadily upward to the right and ends at 8 seconds comma 0 centimeters. The second graph has a horizontal axis labeled, Time, in seconds and the numbers 0 through 6, in increments of 3, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled, Acceleration, in centimeters per second squared, and there are 7 evenly spaced marks on the axis. The shape of the graph is sinusoidal. The data from the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The graph begins at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis and then moves steadily downward and to the right and reaches a minimum at the point 1 second and the third mark on the vertical axis below the horizontal axis. It then curves upward and moves steadily upward and to the right and reaches a maximum at 3 seconds, and the third mark on the vertical axis above the horizontal axis. The line then curves downward and moves steadily downward and to the right reaches a minimum at 5 seconds and the third mark on the vertical axis below  the horizontal axis. It then curves upwards and moves steadily upward and to the right and reaches a maximum at 7 seconds and the third mark on the vertical axis above the horizontal axis. The line then curves downward and moves steadily downward and to the right where it ends on the horizontal axis at 8 seconds.\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH984592.g04.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graphs of position and acceleration as functions of time for an oscillating simple pendulum are shown.
