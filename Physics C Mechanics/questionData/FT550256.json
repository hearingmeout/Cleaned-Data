The spring is attached to the left end of the track, as shown in the figure above, and produces a nonlinear restoring force of magnitude <em>F<sub>s</sub></em> = <em>As</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>B<sub>s</sub></em>, where <em>s</em> is the distance the spring is compressed, in meters. A measuring tape, marked in centimeters, is attached to the side of the track. The student places five photogates on the track at the locations shown.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Derive an expression for the potential energy <em>U</em> as a function of the compression <em>s</em>. Express your answer in terms of <em>A, B, s</em>, and fundamental constants, as appropriate.</p>\n\n\t<p>In a preliminary experiment, the student pushes the cart of mass 0.30 kg into the spring, compressing the spring 0.040 m. For this spring, <em>A</em> = 200 N/m<sup>2</sup> and <em>B</em> = 150 N/m. The cart is released from rest. Assume friction and air resistance are negligible <strong>only</strong> during the short time interval when the spring is accelerating the cart.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Calculate the following:</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The speed of the cart immediately after it loses contact with the spring</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The impulse given to the cart by the spring</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\n\t<p>In a second experiment, the student collects data using the photogates. Each photogate measures the speed of the cart as it passes through the gate. The student calculates a spring compression that should give the cart a speed of 0.320 m/s after the cart loses contact with the spring. The student runs the experiment by pushing the cart into the spring, compressing the spring the calculated distance, and releasing the cart. The speeds are measured with a precision of +0.002 m/s. The positions are measured with a precision of +0.005 m.</p>\n\n\t<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with three rows. The first row read Photogate, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
