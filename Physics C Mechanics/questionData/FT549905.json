Both figures show a horizontal spring fixed to a wall at its left end with the right end free to move. In figure 1, the spring is indicated to have spring constant k equals 400 newtons per meter. The right end of the spring is attached to block C with mass 4 kilograms. Block D with mass 2 kilograms sits to the right of block C with their adjacent faces touching. In figure 2, the spring is shown to be compressed. Block C is still attached to the right end of the spring, but because the spring is compressed it is now 0.5 meter to the left of where it was in figure 1. Block D is in the same location as in figure 1, and is therefore no longer touching block C. A coefficient of friction mu equals 0.4 is indicated. \" height=\"102\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/646346796beb0ee4ffe5d261023e9363/original.png\" width=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p>A massless spring with force constant <em>k</em> = 400 newtons per meter is fastened at its left end to a vertical wall, as shown in Figure I.
