Just after leaving the ramp, the bicycle’s wheels are rotating clockwise, as shown in the figure. While in the air, the cyclist applies the bicycle’s rear brake, stopping the rotation of the rear wheel. Which of the following indicates how the rest of the bicycle rotates, if at all, after the rear brake has been applied and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR715707_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The rest of the bicycle does not rotate because there is no net torque exerted on the bicycle.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The rest of the bicycle does not rotate because angular momentum is constant for the bicycle-cyclist system.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The rest of the bicycle rotates clockwise because there is an external torque exerted on the bicycle-cyclist system.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The rest of the bicycle rotates clockwise because the decrease in clockwise rotation of the wheels is balanced by an increase in clockwise rotation of the bicycle.</p>"],"answer":3}]
