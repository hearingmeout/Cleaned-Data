In separate experimental trials, the pulley string on one of the pulleys is pulled downward with a constant force and the angular acceleration of the pulley is determined. The rotational inertia is the same for both pulleys, even though the radius is larger for the pulley in Trial <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2\"><math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math></span></span>. Is the angular acceleration the same or different in the two trials? What reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR718452_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The same.
