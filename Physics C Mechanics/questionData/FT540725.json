There are 4 evenly spaced tick marks on the horizontal axis labeled 5, 10, 15, and 20 from left to right.  There are 5 evenly spaced tick marks on the vertical axis labeled negative 10, negative 5, 0, 5, and 10 from bottom to top. The graph consists of 4 solid line segments as follows: beginning at the origin, the first straight line segment starts at the origin and extends up and to the right to the point 5 comma 10.  Then the second line segment starts at this point and extends horizontally to the point 10 comma 10.  The third line segment starts at this point and extends down and to the right to the point 15 comma negative 10. Then the fourth line segment starts at this point and extends horizontally to point 20 comma negative 10. There are dashed lines on the figure as follows.  There is a horizontal dashed line that extends from the vertical axis to the graph at point 5 comma 10.  There is a horizontal dashed line that extends from the vertical axis to the graph at point 15 comma negative 10.  There is a dashed vertical line that extends from the horizontal up to the graph at point 5 comma 10.  There is a dashed vertical line that extends from the horizontal axis up to the graph at point 10 comma 10. There is a dashed vertical line that extends from the horizontal down to the graph at point 15 comma negative 10. There is a dashed vertical line that extends from the horizontal axis down to the graph at point 20 comma negative 10.\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d9807aaf9899436ce39922ec0a740e48/original.png\" width=\"250\" /></p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>7.5 J</p>","<p>10 J</p>","<p>50 J</p>","<p>75 J</p>","<p>100 J</p>"],"answer":2}]
