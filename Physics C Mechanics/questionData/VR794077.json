The graph consists of four line segments and one curve. The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Velocity.” The function begins at Point P, above the origin on the vertical axis. The first line segment extends horizontally to the right until it ends at point Q, which is about two fifths of the way along the horizontal axis. The curve begins where the first line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right for a brief period before it ends at point R, which is just below and to the right of point Q. The second line segment begins where the curve ends, and moves steeply downward and to the right. It crosses the horizontal axis and ends at point S, about halfway along the horizontal axis, far below it. The third line segment begins where the second ends, and moves steeply upward and to the right until it ends at point T, which is just above and to the right of point R. The fourth line segment begins where the third ends, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at point U, above the end of the horizontal axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR794077.g02.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The velocity as a function of time for an object moving along a straight line is shown in the graph.
