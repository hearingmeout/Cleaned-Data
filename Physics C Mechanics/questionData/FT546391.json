The horizontal axis is labeled from 0 to 4 in increments of 1 with vertical reference lines drawn in increments of 0.5, forming a grid. A sinusoidal curve is plotted starting at a minimum at 0 and negative 0.35, reaching a maximum at 0.5 and negative 0.15, returning to a minimum at 1 and negative 0.35.

A 0.4 kg object is then attached to the lower end of the spring. The object is pulled down to a distance of 0.35 m below the unstretched position and released from rest at time <em>t</em> = 0 . A graph of the subsequent vertical position <em>y</em> of the lower end of the spring as a function of <em>t</em> is given above, where <em>y</em> = 0 when the spring was initially unstretched.</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>16 N/m</p>","<p>20 N/m</p>","<p>32 N/m</p>","<p>40 N/m</p>","<p>64 N/m</p>"],"answer":-1}]
