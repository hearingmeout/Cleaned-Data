The disk is rotating with a constant angular velocity in the positive direction when, starting at time zero, a torque is exerted on the disk, resulting in the motion shown in the graph of angular velocity as a function of time. Which of the following statements describes what happens to the magnitude of the net torque on the disk for times <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">greater than zero</span>, and provides reasoning to support the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR718450_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It increases.
