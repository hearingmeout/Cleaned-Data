The horizontal axis is labeled “t, in seconds,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “p, in kilogram meters per second,” and the numbers 0 through 15, in increments of 5, are indicated. Eleven points are graphed for each object. The coordinates of the points for the object represented by circles are as follows: 0 comma 12; 1 comma 12; 2 comma 12; 3 comma 12; 4 comma 12; 5 comma 12; 6 comma 15; 7 comma 15; 8 comma 15; 9 comma 15; and 10 comma 15. The approximate coordinates of the points for the object represented by triangles are as follows: 0 comma 6; 1 comma 6; 2 comma 6; 3 comma 6; 4 comma 6; 5 comma 6; 6 comma 3; 7 comma 3; 8 comma 3; 9 comma 3; and 10 comma 3.
