Their procedure involves stacking a number of coffee filters, like the one shown in the figure above, and dropping the stack from rest. The students change the number of filters in the stack to vary the mass m while keeping the shape of the stack the same. As a stack of coffee filters falls, there is an air resistance (drag) force acting on the filters.</p>\n\n<p>a. The students suspect that the drag force <em>F<sub>D</sub></em> is proportional to the square of the speed <em>v</em> : FD = <em>Cv</em><sup>2</sup> , where <em>C</em> is a constant. Using this relationship, derive an expression relating the terminal speed <em>v<sub>T</sub></em> to the mass <em>m</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The students conduct the experiment and obtain the following data.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with four rows, with only the second and third rows filled in.
