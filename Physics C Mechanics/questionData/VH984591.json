The block sits on a flat horizontal surface. There are 2 marks indicated on the horizontal surface, x sub min is to the left of the block and x sub max is a good distance to the right of the block. In the graph, the horizontal axis is labeled x and the vertical axis is labeled U sub s. 2 points are labeled on the horizontal axis, each the same distance from the vertical axis. The point labeled x sub min is on the horizontal axis to the left of the vertical axis and the point labeled x sub max is on the horizontal axis to the right of the vertical axis. A curve on the graph is a concave up parabola that begins to the left of the vertical axis high above the point x sub min and extends downward and to the right until it reaches its minimum at a point that is the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axis.
