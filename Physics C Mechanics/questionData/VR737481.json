The graph shows the net force on the cart as a function of time during a short time interval. Does the graph provide sufficient information to determine the change in momentum of the cart during the time interval shown, and what evidence supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR737481_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the change in momentum is equal to the area under the curve of the force-versus-time graph.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the change in momentum is equal to the slope of the force-versus-time graph.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the initial momentum is unknown and therefore the change in momentum cannot be determined.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the force is not constant and therefore the change in momentum cannot be determined.</p>"],"answer":0}]
