The string is rewound around the pole to bring the large block back to its original location. The small blocks are detached from the rod and then suspended from each end of the rod, using strings of length ℓ . The system is again released from rest so that as the large block descends and the apparatus rotates, the small blocks swing outward, as shown in Experiment B above.
