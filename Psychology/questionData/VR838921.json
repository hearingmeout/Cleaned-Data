She tested this using sensation of weight. Participants were blindfolded and given two equal weights to hold one in each hand. With each trial, she added a slightly heavier weight to one hand than the other. The participant was asked to notify her if or when one felt heavier. She found that it was more difficult for the participants to determine the difference in the weights when the equal weights from the first trial were heavy.</p></div></div></div></body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A correlational study</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A meta-analysis</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">An experiment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A cross-sectional study</p>"],"answer":2}]
