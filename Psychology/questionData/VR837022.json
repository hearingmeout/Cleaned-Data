Dr. Naum administers a battery of tasks multiple times over the course of several weeks to assess J.S.’s cognitive abilities. The graph below shows J.S.’s performance on three different tasks. The bar on the left shows his accuracy forming new memories in a lab context, the middle bar shows his accuracy on a driving course, and the bar on the right shows his accuracy on a third task.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 3 bars. Three categories are indicated on the horizontal axis: Ability to Recall New Events, Drive Course Performance, and Task 3. The vertical axis is labeled Accuracy, and the numbers 0 through 90, in increments of 10, are indicated. The value of the bars are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Ability to Recall New Events; 5 Accuracy. Drive Course Performance; 85 accuracy. Task 3; 10 Accuracy.  \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR837022.g04.svg\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the scores on the three tasks, Task 3 most likely involves</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR837022_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">recalling the names of all his cousins</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">matching photos of his aunts and uncles with their siblings</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">remembering events that occurred shortly before his accident</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">holding a random string of numbers in memory for several seconds</p>"],"answer":2}]
