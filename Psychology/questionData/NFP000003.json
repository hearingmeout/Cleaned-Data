As part of this study, high school students were asked to complete an attribution inventory that assessed their beliefs about the factors that determine their high school GPA. These factors included whether students believed their GPA was due to their intelligence and determination or luck.</p><p class=\"dap_body\">The researchers focused on students who attributed their high school GPA to luck and compared their attribution inventory score with their actual high school GPA, which is shown in the graph. Higher scores indicate a more external attribution for GPA.</p><div class=\"standalone_image qti-align-center\"><img alt=\"A scatterplot titled Attribution Inventory Score and Grade Point Average.
