On the door to the lab there was a brightly colored poster asking for a missing necklace to be returned. The researcher would use a random number generator to decide which poster each participant would see when they walked in. For the extrinsic motivation group, the poster included a monetary reward. For the control group, the poster did not include any monetary reward. In both conditions, the participant would find the necklace from the poster in the only chair at the desk in the lab. The number of times that the necklace was returned to the owner was measured.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following concepts was used in the study to control for the social desirability bias?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR855119_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Single-blind procedure</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Double-blind procedure</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Operational definitions of the variables</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Placebo</p>"],"answer":0}]
