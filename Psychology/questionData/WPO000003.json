All the two-year-old children were developing along standard physical, social, and emotional timelines. The average age of the children was 27.05 months (2.25 years), and an equal number of boys and girls participated.

The children played in a supervised, child-friendly room. Meanwhile, in a separate room, the researchers trained the mothers regarding the meaning of two completely new words: <i>blicking</i> (meaning a type of bouncing) and <i>frepping</i> (meaning a type of shaking). The researchers made up these words and their meanings for the purpose of this study. To demonstrate <i>blicking</i> to their child, each mother was provided an 18-inch gender-neutral<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fn551ee5b9d6974393bf9bd39b03fa6429\" id=\"ref551ee5b9d6974393bf9bd39b03fa6429\">2</a></sup></span>&nbsp;doll.

The researchers told each mother to expect occasional phone calls during the study. During each call, the researchers provided one of three directions to the mother: 1) begin teaching the new word (teaching phase), 2) move to the next word (transition phase), or 3) engage in a conversation with the researcher as if talking with a friend (interruption phase).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">To initiate the teaching phase, the researchers called each mother and told her to teach the designated word to her child. Half of the mothers were told to teach <i>blicking</i> first while the other half were told to teach <i>frepping</i> first. The researchers interrupted half of the mothers while the mothers taught their first word and then interrupted the second half of the mothers while the mothers taught their second word. For the uninterrupted teaching phase, each mother received a transition call from a researcher that instructed her to start teaching the identified word.

After about 30 seconds, the researchers instructed the mother to continue teaching her child the assigned word. Each mother had an additional 30 seconds to teach the word.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The researchers counted how many times the mothers used the words<i> blicking </i>or <i>frepping </i>during the instruction sessions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">After receiving instruction on <i>blicking</i> and <i>frepping</i>, each child sat in their mother’s lap and watched a video. The video began with an attention-getting image in the center of the screen (an image of a laughing baby) followed by the instruction to “Find [<i>blicking</i> or <i>frepping</i>].” The video then transitioned to a scene in which a puppet demonstrated the appropriate action for each word (bouncing for <i>blicking</i> and shaking for <i>frepping</i>) or demonstrated an unrelated action (twisting side to side or putting a hand on a box while standing up). Researchers measured how long the children paid attention to the action in the video to determine whether the children learned <i>blicking</i> or <i>frepping</i>. The mothers closed their eyes during the video to avoid accidentally cueing the children to pay attention to the correct action in the video.&nbsp;Researchers informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">On average, the mothers repeated the word approximately 24 times in the interrupted teaching phase and approximately 20 times in the uninterrupted teaching phase. The difference was not statistically significant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The children paid attention to the word they learned in the uninterrupted session for an average of 0.63 seconds and in the interrupted session for an average of 0.50 seconds. The difference in means was statistically significant, suggesting that in-person interruptions between parent and child can affect how well young children learn vocabulary words.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_sourceattribution\">Reed.
