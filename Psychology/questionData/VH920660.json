The psychologist got fellow content experts to look at the questions to confirm that they are the types of puzzles and problems that would provide an intellectual challenge and give insight into someone’s intellectual abilities. Unfortunately, when he distributes the test to a classroom of college students, it does not appear to perform similarly to existing measures of intelligence. The test does not predict student GPAs and in fact is better at predicting performance on a measure of anxiety than intelligence.
