The higher the scores on the survey, the more the students agree with the issues. During the term, students are given a reading assignment or video lecture about each issue at least twice, using studies sourced by reputable professional organizations. The data from these studies often contradicted the issues presented in the surveys. The surveys were given again at the end of the course to see if student attitudes about the social issues changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best explains the data from the table?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR855092_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Student attitudes did not change much despite getting reputable information about the issues.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Student attitudes became more extreme as the semester went on.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cognitive dissonance is likely the reasons student responses remained consistent.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Students conformed to the views of the professor.</p>"],"answer":0}]
