She created a survey that asks volunteer participants from the college where she works how stressful they find different kinds of stimuli. The survey uses a scale starting at 1 which means they find the stimulus not stressful at all and ends at 5 which means they find the stimulus extremely stressful. She then collects their overall grade point average data and compares their survey ratings to their grade point averages.</p></div></div></div></body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Situational attribution</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Drive-reduction theory</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yerkes-Dodson Law</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Law of Effect</p>"],"answer":2}]
