One hundred babies are randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In one condition babies would only be exposed to phonemes of their primary language for one hour per day over the course of six months. The other group would be exposed to phonemes from several different languages for one hour per day over the course of six months. The researchers hoped to explore whether exposure to phonemes from several different languages helped or impeded language development.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following concerns would an IRB likely have about this study?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR853815_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There would be no way to get informed consent.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The procedure could potentially cause harm to the babies by interfering with their language development.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is too much deception involved in this research proposal.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There would be no way to keep the information about each child confidential.</p>"],"answer":1}]
