It then moves downward and to the right at a decreasing rate until it ends and is nearly horizontal, just above the end of the horizontal axis. The area under the curve is divided into eight sections of equal width. From left to right, the segments are labeled as follows: 0.13%, 2.14%, 13.59%, 34.13%, 34.13%, 13.59%, 2.14%, and 0.13%.
