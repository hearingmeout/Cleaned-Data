The existing test was considered valid and reliable. In the psychologists’ new test, participants had to find an image hidden in a visual display as quickly as possible. The psychologists collected data to determine the relation between the number of items the participants answered correctly on the original standardized test and the time it took them to spot the hidden image on the new test. The graph below displays the results.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane.
