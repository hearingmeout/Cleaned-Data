The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Cumulative Number of Responses.” The lines are labeled Variable Ratio, Fixed Ratio, Variable Interval, and Fixed Interval. The variable ratio line begins at the origin and slants steeply upward and to the right. The fixed ratio line begins to the right of the variable ratio line and slants steeply upward and to the right, but slightly less steeply than the variable ratio line. The variable internal line begins to the right of the fixed ratio line, and slants gradually upward and to the right. The fixed interval line begins to the right of the variable interval line, is composed of five curves, and generally slants gradually upward and to the right, less steeply than the variable interval line.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR853828.g01.svg\"/>\n</div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the graph, which schedule of reinforcement would a parent choose to create the fastest rate of learning in their child?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR853828_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Variable Ratio</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Variable Interval</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Fixed Interval</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Fixed Ratio</p>"],"answer":0}]
