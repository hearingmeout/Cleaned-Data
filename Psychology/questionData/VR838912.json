This view of recovery focuses on social causes of substance use and abuse, such as poverty, physical or emotional abuse in one’s home, or homelessness, and teaching people how to deal with those stressors through more healthful ways of thinking and behaving. The women participated in four group interviews over a six-month period that were recorded and transcribed word-for-word. Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected.&nbsp;A team of three researchers analyzed the recordings and transcripts. Researchers developed a code manual that “organized the data for accurate interpretation” across all three researchers. Researchers first developed a list of codes that corresponded to common aspects of successful recovery programs. Then, as the responses were read, the researchers would categorize each response with an existing code. Researchers would add a new code for each new topic the participants brought up in their responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Four major themes for successful recovery programs emerged from the participants’ responses based on the most frequently occurring codes:</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Knowledge of addiction as a disease – Participants shared that they did not often realize that their substance use could be classified as an addiction. The researchers coded participant responses that referenced overuse or “abusive” use of substances as indications of addiction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Importance of social support and support groups – Participants shared the importance of three main kinds of social support: 1) family and friend support; 2) organized support groups, and 3) support from other participants in the recovery program. Attending support groups while living in the recovery program helped women develop positive support and broke down barriers to recovery like lack of transportation, childcare, or accountability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Peace of mind that comes from a new lifestyle – Participants shared that while their lives were not stress-free, they felt a sense of peace by not using substances. The participants reported that being in the program taught them ways to reconsider their responses to stress more effectively, leading to a sense of peace instead of turmoil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Desire to maintain recovery – Many participants reported that they wanted to maintain their new substance-free lifestyles. One participant reported that “I’m going to do whatever it is I have to do to make sure that we [she and her child] don’t ever have to go back to that [being homeless and abusing substances].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">After categorizing the responses from the participants into these four categories, the researchers believe that the participants’ responses show that the program had a positive impact on the participants’ recovery. The researchers recommend that programs follow a similar model of recovery to improve outcomes for women experiencing substance use disorders.</p>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology</span>.</span><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Krueger, E., Deal, E., Lopez.
