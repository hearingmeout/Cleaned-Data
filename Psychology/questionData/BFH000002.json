Participants are given 5 minutes to memorize 30 unrelated words. Then Dr. Hart randomly assigns the participants to one of two groups. In Group 1, participants are not allowed to sleep uninterrupted. Instead, they are awakened each time their EEG shows they are in the REM sleep phase. In Group 2, participants are allowed to sleep for up to 8 uninterrupted hours. The next day, the participants are asked to recall as many unrelated words as possible. </p><p class=\"dap_body\">The mean score for Group 1 is 7 words. The mean score for Group 2 is 12 words. Dr. Hart finds that the differences are statistically significant.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">8 hours of uninterrupted sleep</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Monitoring participants each time their EEG indicates they are in NREM sleep</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Awakening participants each time their EEG indicates REM sleep</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The number of unrelated words remembered after the observed night of sleep</p>"],"answer":"C-29265"}]
