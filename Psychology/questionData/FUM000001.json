Identical twins are genetically identical and share the same DNA pattern. Fraternal twins are only as genetically similar as any other sibling pair. Researchers found that 9 out of 16 pairs of the identical twins were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, while 1 out of 14 pairs of the fraternal twins were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_copyright\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">Holland, A.J., Hall, A., Murray, R., Russell, G.F., &amp; Crisp, A.H.
