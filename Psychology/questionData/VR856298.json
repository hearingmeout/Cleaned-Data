The findings indicated significant connections between the number of ACEs, such as financial struggles and parental stress, and the number of health and developmental issues in children. A higher number of these early childhood stressors increased the likelihood of problems. The study also indicated that children who expressed affection toward their parents managed these challenges more effectively.</p></div></div><div class=\"standalone_image\"><div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Understanding the Impact of Early Challenges on Child Health and Development</p></div><img alt=\"The figure shows a scatterplot titled “Understanding the Impact of Early Challenges on Child Health and Development.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Number of Challenging Childhood Experiences,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 5, are indicated.
