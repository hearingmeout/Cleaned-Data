The horizontal axis is labeled “Time.” The vertical axis is labeled “Strength of C R.” The label Weak is indicated at the bottom of the vertical axis, and the label Strong is indicated near the top of the vertical axis. The first portion of the graph is labeled C S plus U S, and the second portion is labeled C S alone. Three vertical grid lines extend from the horizontal axis. The graph begins at the origin, labeled Weak, and curves upward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a sharp maximum at a point high above the horizontal axis, which is on the first vertical grid line. It then curves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches a minimum on the horizontal axis at the second vertical grid line. The space between the last two vertical lines is labeled Time Delay at the top, and Pause at the bottom. The graph begins again on the third vertical gridline, about halfway up the vertical axis, and curves downward and to the right until it ends on the horizonal axis, far to the right of the origin.\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184533.g11.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The above graph of conditioning shows which of the following concepts?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR184533_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Habituation and blocking</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Positive and negative reinforcement</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Generalization, discrimination, and higher order conditioning</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery</p>"],"answer":4}]
