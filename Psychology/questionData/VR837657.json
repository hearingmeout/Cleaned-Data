Moving to the right from this vertical line, degrees are indicated from 90 degrees to 0 degrees at the right horizontal side of the semicircle. The focus point is indicated just to the right of the 90 degree line.

Research participants were asked to stare at a focus point while the researcher, starting at 0º, moved a red-colored object slowly around the edge of the arc apparatus. The degree of the angle when the participants first observed movement and color were documented. The mean degrees for each are presented in the table. Which of the following conclusions is best supported by this data?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR837657_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The average angle the participant first notices movement will be larger than the average angle for first noticing the color.</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The average angle the participant first notices the color will be larger than the average angle for first noticing movement.</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The average angle the participant first notices the color will be the same as the average angle for first noticing movement.</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is not enough evidence to predict how each person will perceive based on the photoreceptors of the retina.</p>"],"answer":0}]
