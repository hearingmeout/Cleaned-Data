He believes that students are overly stressed because they are involved in too many activities. He conducts a study with his students. He asks them to give up one activity that causes stress for two weeks. He gives them a short survey measuring their stress levels, and then after two weeks of reducing their activities, he gives them the same stress evaluation test and compares the two measures. Dr. Singer concludes that fewer stressors reduce stress levels.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">What would limit the generalizability of Dr. Singer’s findings?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR856297_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dr. Singer did not clearly define his population.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dr. Singer used a convenience sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dr. Singer did not have a valid hypothesis.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dr. Singer did not have a control group.</p>"],"answer":1}]
