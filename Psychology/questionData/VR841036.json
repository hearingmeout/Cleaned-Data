In this study, researchers examined whether participants in a messy room would be more creative than participants in an orderly room. Researchers hypothesized that being in a disorderly room encourages people to break with a customary routine and frees them to be more creative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Forty-eight American students participated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were randomly assigned to complete a task in an orderly or disorderly room.

Two raters, unaware of the condition to which participants had been assigned, scored each idea on a 3-point scale (1 = not at all creative, 3 = very creative). If raters disagreed on a score, they resolved it through discussion. Creativity was measured both by averaging creativity scores for each participant and by counting the number of uses participants generated for ping-pong balls. The statistically significant findings are summarized in the table.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:3\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:left colname:col1 colnum:1\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col2 colnum:2\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col3 colnum:3\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition:</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Average Creativity Scores:</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Mean Number of highly creative ideas</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Messy room</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">1.80</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">1.0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Tidy room</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">1.41</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">0.21</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers believed that the results support their hypothesis that being in a messy room stimulates more creative ideas. In their opinion, being in a messy room disrupts a person’s customary routines resulting in more creative thinking. However, researchers acknowledge another explanation for their findings. It may be that being in a messy room violates participants’ expectations about what a room should look like and that might have increased participant creativity.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Adapted from Vohs, K.

Evidence from prior studies suggests that being in a messy environment increases one’s ability to come up with more creative solutions with less reliance on preexisting ways of viewing the world. This study investigated the effect of messy work environments on creativity and these higher-level cognitive processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">One hundred volunteers participated in the study (age: mean 22.89 years, standard deviation = 5.19, 69% women, 31% men, 81% right-handed, 19% left-handed).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Methods</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained prior to participation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were randomly assigned to two adjacent classrooms; one classroom was tidy, and the other was messy. All participants first completed the Alternative Uses Task, in which they generated up to 10 unusual uses for an automobile tire in 5 minutes. Two raters measured the creativity of each participant on a 5-point scale (5 = higher creativity; 1 = lower creativity) by considering how commonplace, unusual, and clever the participant’s responses were. When the ratings of the independent raters were compared on their creativity scores, they were highly correlated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">To measure cognitive processing, participants completed additional tests. In one test, called a digit span task, participants were given a series of numbers and asked to repeat back what they had heard. In each subsequent trial a longer sequence of numbers was presented. The longest remembered sequence was the measure of the participant’s digit span. Researchers also included a letter fluency test, in which participants were given 1 minute to produce as many unique words as possible starting with a given letter, either “L” or “F.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were debriefed and compensated with either a $20.00 gift card or extra credit for their introductory psychology course at the completion of the study.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers compared the creativity and cognitive processing measures between the tidy and messy conditions. Results indicated that working at a messy desk did not result in significant and reliable differences in creativity or in the performance of tasks related to higher level cognitive processing. The results from the described tests are summarized in the table.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:4\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col2 colnum:2\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col3 colnum:3\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col4 colnum:4\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition:</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Alternative Uses Task Creativity Mean</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Digit Span Mean</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Letter Fluency Mean Correct</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Messy room</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">2.68</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">4.02</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">22.98</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Tidy room</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">2.80</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">4.44</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">21.96</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers identified some possible limitations to their study that might explain the lack of statistically significant differences in the results obtained from the two conditions. One earlier study asked participants to develop alternative uses for a ping-pong ball using a 3-point creativity scale, while this study used an automobile tire, and a 5-point scale. However, this research used many different measures of creativity and of higher-level cognitive processing, and none showed the expected effect.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Manzi, A., Durmysheva, Y., Pinegar, S.

Questions included statements such as, “I do certain things that are bad for me if they are fun,” and “I have self-discipline.” Each statement was evaluated from 1 “Not at all like me” to 5 “Very much like me.” Based on this survey, they were sorted into two levels of self-control, either “high trait self-control” or “low trait self-control.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">All participants were then asked to hold their breath “for as long as you are able or until you have to give up,” and the experimenter timed the duration with a stopwatch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">After establishing each participant’s breath-holding ability in a neutral space, participants were randomly assigned to either an orderly or a disorderly room. As pictured, in the orderly condition (A), books, pens, and other items were arranged in a structured and ordered way on a table. In the disorderly condition (B), the same quantity of items was scattered on the table or on the floor.

Participants’ ideas were scored by five research assistants who were unaware of the different conditions to which each participant was assigned. Each response received a rating on a five-point scale (1 = low creativity, 5 = high creativity).
