The participant read 25 different word-pairs (e.g., <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">strong–arm</span>) that the “learner” had to recall. If the “learner” gave an incorrect answer, the participant administered an electric shock using a “shock generator” that had switches ranging from 15 to 450 volts in 15-volt increments. The shock was fake, but the participant did not know this. The. The participant moved up one switch on the shock generator for each incorrect answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">While the participants watched, the researcher strapped the “learners” into a chair with electrodes. The participant then went to another room for the remainder of the study. The “learners” gave correct and incorrect responses according to a predetermined schedule. After participants pressed the 75-volt switch, they heard a small grunt from the “learner.” The grunts got louder after each successive shock. When a participant pressed the 150-volt switch, the “learner” yelled, “Ugh. Get me out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart’s starting to bother me now. I refuse to go on. Let me out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">If the participant expressed reluctance or hesitation at any time, the researcher gave one of four directions, in this order: “Please continue”; “The research requires that you continue”; “It is absolutely essential that you continue”; and “You have no other choice, you must continue.” The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The base condition ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In the <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">modeled refusal condition</span>, the procedures were the same as the base condition except for an additional confederate who was paired with each participant. The men were paired with a White man in his 50s. Women were paired with a White woman in her late 20s. The researcher pretended to randomly choose the participant to be Teacher 2 and the additional confederate to be Teacher 1. Teacher 1 administered shocks to the “learner” according to the procedures as the participant watched. At the 90-volt shock level, Teacher 1 said to the researcher, “I don’t know about this.” The researcher responded with “Please continue.” Teacher 1 paused and then said, “I don’t think I can do this,” and pushed their chair from the table. The researcher then asked Teacher 2 (the participant) to continue the test, picking up where Teacher 1 left off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">As with the base condition, if the participant (Teacher 2) expressed reluctance or hesitation, the researcher gave one of the four directions as described.

Participant education and race/ethnicity demographics are presented in the table.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered lrn_width_auto\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Education and Ethnicity</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Number of Participants</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Percentage of Participants</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Education</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">High school or less</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">12</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">17.1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Some college</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">16</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">22.9</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Bachelor’s degree</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">28</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">40.0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Master’s degree</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">14</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">20.0</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Ethnicity</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">White</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">38</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">54.3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;Asian</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">19</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">26.7</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Latino/a/Hispanic</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">9</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">12.9</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">African American</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">3</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">4.3</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Did not state</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">1</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">1.4</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>A committee of professionals reviewed the study to ensure the appropriateness of the study before researchers began.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the “base” condition and the “modeled refusal” condition. The participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw at any time and keep the $50 they were paid to participate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In the <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">base condition</span>, the participant was paired with a “learner,” who was a research confederate. The participant read 25 different word-pairs (e.g., <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">strong–arm</span>) that the “learner” had to recall. If the “learner” gave an incorrect answer, the participant administered an electric shock using a “shock generator” that had switches ranging from 15 to 450 volts in 15-volt increments. The shock was fake, but the participant did not know this. The. The participant moved up one switch on the shock generator for each incorrect answer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">While the participants watched, the researcher strapped the “learners” into a chair with electrodes. The participant then went to another room for the remainder of the study. The “learners” gave correct and incorrect responses according to a predetermined schedule. After participants pressed the 75-volt switch, they heard a small grunt from the “learner.” The grunts got louder after each successive shock. When a participant pressed the 150-volt switch, the “learner” yelled, “Ugh. Get me out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart’s starting to bother me now. I refuse to go on. Let me out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">If the participant expressed reluctance or hesitation at any time, the researcher gave one of four directions, in this order: “Please continue”; “The research requires that you continue”; “It is absolutely essential that you continue”; and “You have no other choice, you must continue.” The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The base condition ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In the <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">modeled refusal condition</span>, the procedures were the same as the base condition except for an additional confederate who was paired with each participant. The men were paired with a White man in his 50s. Women were paired with a White woman in her late 20s. The researcher pretended to randomly choose the participant to be Teacher 2 and the additional confederate to be Teacher 1. Teacher 1 administered shocks to the “learner” according to the procedures as the participant watched. At the 90-volt shock level, Teacher 1 said to the researcher, “I don’t know about this.” The researcher responded with “Please continue.” Teacher 1 paused and then said, “I don’t think I can do this,” and pushed their chair from the table. The researcher then asked Teacher 2 (the participant) to continue the test, picking up where Teacher 1 left off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">As with the base condition, if the participant (Teacher 2) expressed reluctance or hesitation, the researcher gave one of the four directions as described. The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The modeled refusal condition also ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">When the study was over, the researcher explained informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete, specifically that the “learner” was not receiving electric shocks. The “learner” entered the lab room at that point to assure the participant that they were fine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Number (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:4\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:left colname:col1 colnum:1 colwidth:160\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col4 colnum:4\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Behavior</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Base Condition</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Modeled Refusal Condition</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Milgram’s Original Study</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">12 (30%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">11 (36.7%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">7 (17.5%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">28 (70%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">19 (63.3%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">33 (82.5%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Numbers (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued, By Gender</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:3\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:left colname:col1 colnum:1 colwidth:160\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Condition and Behavior</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Men</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Women</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Base condition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">6 (33.3%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">6 (27.3%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">12 (66.7%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">16 (72.7%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Modeled Refusal Condition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">5 (45.5%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">6 (31.6%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">6 (54.5%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">13 (68.4%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Burger, J.M.
