The students devise a study in which one of them will pretend to fall while riding a scooter. The students choose a confederate from among the group to ride the scooter. The confederate will fall at the same location when many students are present. Then, the next day, the confederate will fall at the same location when fewer students are present. After each fall, the confederate will record whether they are helped.</p>\n</div>\n</body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">The number of people at the location when the confederate fell</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The level of experience of the scooter rider</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The location on the campus where the confederate fell</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The students on campus who watched the confederate fall off the scooter</p>"],"answer":"A-46696"}]
