He recruited volunteers from a high school Spanish class and randomly assigned students to learn a list of 100 new vocabulary words for which they were later given a word recall test. Students prepared for the word recall test using either distributed practice by studying for 30 minutes a day the week before the test, or massed practice by intensively studying the night before the test. </p>\n</div>\n</body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Massed practice</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Distributed practice</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">High school students</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Word recall</p>"],"answer":"D-96042"}]
