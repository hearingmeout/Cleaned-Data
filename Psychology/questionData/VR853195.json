The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Physical and Cognitive Abilities.” The curve begins on the vertical axis, slightly above the origin, and moves steadily upward and to the right. As it approaches about the halfway point along the horizontal axis, the curve begins to level off and reaches a peak near the top of the vertical axis. The curve then moves downward and to the right, steadily at first. However, about three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis, it begins to move more irregularly downward and to the right, including moving nearly horizontally for a short period of time, then moving steeply downward before moving down more gradually and to the right. Finally, the curve moves steeply downward again and ends above the horizontal axis at about the same height as where it began along the vertical axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR853195.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The information presented in the graph best represents which of the following aspects of developmental psychology research?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR853195_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The amount of time it takes for a child to learn the visual cliff</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The progression of cognitive and physical abilities throughout the lifespan</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">An infant’s interest in gazing at human faces</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The number of friends people accumulate throughout the lifespan</p>"],"answer":1}]
