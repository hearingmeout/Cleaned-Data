The bell curve begins at negative 3, M equals negative 1.5, on the horizontal axis and moves upward and to the right at an increasing rate. About halfway along the axis, the curve begins to level off and reaches a peak above the 0, M equals 4.5. It then moves downward and to the right at an increasing rate.
