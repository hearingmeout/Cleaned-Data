The categories Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 are indicated on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Stress Level,” and the categories Low and High are indicated on the bottom and top of the axis, respectively. A dashed horizontal line extends from the midpoint of the vertical axis. The curve begins at the dashed line on the vertical axis, and is nearly horizontal at first as it begins moving through Phase 1. It then moves slightly downward and to the right until it reaches a low when a stressor occurs. From here, the curve moves upward and to the right until it reaches a point that is about halfway between the dashed line and the top of the vertical axis. It then moves horizontally to the right through phase 2 at this high stress level. About two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis, the curve moves downward and to the right into phase 3. It crosses the dashed horizontal line and begins to level off as it reaches a low below the dashed horizontal line.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR854846.g03.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following concepts is depicted in the figure?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR854846_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The general adaptation syndrome (GAS)</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The diathesis-stress model</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bipolar disorder</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tend-and-befriend model</p>"],"answer":0}]
