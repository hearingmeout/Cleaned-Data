The vertical axis is labeled “Change in IQ Points,” and the numbers negative 5 through 40, in increments of 5, are indicated. There are four lines in the line graph. A key indicates that one line represents “Fullscale I Q,” one line represents “Crystallized I Q,” one line represents “Fluid I Q,” and one line represents “Spatial I Q.” All of the lines begin around 0 I Q points in 1908, and move generally upward and to the right. The Fullscale I Q line ends around 30 I Q points in 2012, the Crystalized I Q line ends around 20 I Q points in 2012, the Fluid I Q line ends around 37 I Q points in 2012, and the Spatial I Q line ends around 26 I Q points in 2012.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR839926.g01.svg\"/>\n</div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The trend of IQ scores presented in the graph is most consistent with which of the following?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR839926_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The movement toward culture-fair testing</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Stereotype threat</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Changes to the questions in an IQ test</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Flynn Effect</p>"],"answer":3}]
