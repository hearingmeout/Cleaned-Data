Researchers conducted two experiments to determine how much interference the color of the letters of the word affected people’s ability to identify either the word or the color of the letters (e.g., the Stroop task).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 1: 70 college undergraduates participated (14 men and 56 women).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 2: 100 students participated (88 undergraduates; 29 men and 59 women) and 12 graduate students (all women).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 1 tested how quickly participants could read the names of colors. The researcher used two sets of color-name stimuli in this study. The first set of color names (red, blue, green, brown, and purple) was printed in black ink.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The second set of color names (also red, blue, green, brown, and purple) was printed in a different color than the name of the color. No word in this set was printed in the color it named, but it was printed an equal number of times in each of the other four colors (e.g., the word “red” was printed in blue, green, brown, and purple inks; the word “blue” was printed in red, green, brown, and purple inks, etc.). Participants were to read the words in each list as fast as they could, ignoring the color of the ink in which the word was printed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 2 tested how quickly participants could identify the color of the stimulus they were seeing. He used two sets of stimuli for this study. The first set of stimuli printed solid squares in each of the colors used in Experiment 1 (red, blue, green, brown, and purple). In the second set of stimuli, the words were again printed in a color that did not match the name of the color, as described in Experiment 1. Participants were to say the color of the square or of the letters in the word, ignoring the colors named by the words (e.g., where the word “red” was printed in blue ink, the correct response was “blue,” etc.).</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a diagram of two experiments. Experiment 1 shows the following list of colors presented horizontally from left to right: Purple, Brown, Red, Blue, and Green. The word for each color is presented twice, first in black text and then in a different color text, as follows: the word Purple is red, the word Brown is blue, the word Red is green, the word Blue is brown, and the word Green is purple. Experiment two shows one block for each of the colors listed in experiment 1. The color of the block matches the color of the text, such that the first block is red, the second block is blue, the third block is green, the fourth block is brown, and the fifth block is purple.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR840556.g03.svg\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">For both experiments, participants were to read each item in the list without error.

This research examined associations between students’ attitudes toward in-class device use and learning outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were 187 undergraduate students (63.1% women, 36.9% men; mean age = 20.7 years; standard deviation for age = 5.1; range of ages: 17 to 46) at a large urban public university in the northeastern United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Many students at the college are considered nontraditional based on age and other criteria (e.g., employment, financial independence). In line with the National Center for Education Statistics (2002, 2020), which uses age 24 years and older as an index of nontraditional undergraduate student status, we categorized students in our sample as traditional (ages 17–23 years; number of participants = 164; mode age of 18 years) or nontraditional (ages 24–46 years; number of participants = 23; mode age of 24 years).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Over the course of the semester, students completed the following online assignments and surveys:</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Attitudes toward in-class use of personal devices:</span> This six-item survey was given only in Week 2 of the course at the beginning of the semester to assess student attitudes about in-class use of personal mobile devices in relation to learning (“I like to be able to use a personal mobile device during class time”) and whether instructors should permit such usage (“Students should be allowed to use personal mobile devices in the classroom to support their learning”). Participant responded using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Concentrating and multitasking while completing schoolwork online:</span> Also in Week 2, students were asked about their ability to concentrate online (“To what extent do you find it hard to concentrate and stay on task when completing course work online?”) and their multitasking behaviors (“To what extent do you multitask [e.g., watch TV or YouTube, check social media, etc.] while completing course work online?”). Participants responded using a 5-point scale (For the questions concerning concentration: “1 = very hard to concentrate, 3 = neither hard nor easy to concentrate, 5 = very easy to concentrate” For the questions concerning frequency of multitasking: “1 = very infrequently, 3 = neutral, 5 = very frequently”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Multiple-choice quizzes:</span> Multiple-choice quizzes were embedded in the online homework assignments administered during Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Each quiz contained 16 to 21 four-option multiple-choice questions on material from class lectures and used as review materials for upcoming tests. Quiz scores (% correct) were averaged across the three homework assignments and used as a measure of learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">End-of-semester technology- and nontechnology-related distractibility:</span> A three-item survey asked students to report the extent to which they were distracted by behaviors related to their own use of personal mobile devices (e.g., laptop, cell phone, tablet, etc.) in course-related contexts (“when completing online assignments, “when reading the textbook,” and “when attending the course”) and by nontechnology-related distractions (“people arriving late,” and “people around them chatting”). Participants responded using a 3-point scale for both contexts (“1 = not distracted, 2 = somewhat distracted, and 3 = very distracted”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Students held neutral to positive views of in-class use of technology, and mostly agreed that instructors should permit their use. For the question “To what extent do you find it hard to concentrate and stay on task when completing course work online?”, most students held a neutral position but leaned toward saying it was somewhat easy to concentrate while studying online (mean = 3.42; standard deviation = 1.04).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In response to the question “To what extent do you multitask (e.g., watch TV or YouTube, check social media, etc.) while completing course work online?”, most students held a neutral view, indicating they multitasked neither frequently nor infrequently (mean = 3.14; standard deviation = 1.22). Researchers failed to find age-related differences in attitudes toward in-class technology use, although they found younger students reported higher rates of multitasking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Age had a negative correlation with students’ self-reported multitasking and a positive correlation with quiz scores. Students’ multitasking tendencies were positively correlated with their attitudes about personal use of mobile devices in class. There was a strong positive correlation between attitudes about the amount of personal device use and how much mobile devices should be permitted in class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Nontraditional students were less likely to report that they multitask online, and they also tended to perform better on the quizzes. However, these two variables (the extent to multitasking while online and quiz performance) were not significantly correlated with each other. Thus, researchers failed to find evidence that multitasking tendencies were on their own predictive of poor learning outcomes or associated with heightened distractibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">There was a statistically significant relationship between better student performance on quizzes and lower self-reported level of distraction using personal mobile devices.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Ober, T.

This practice impairs their academic achievement. This problem gets worse when students take online classes where they cannot be directly monitored by a teacher. Prior research has demonstrated that this tendency to do many things at once impairs our ability to recall information because it disrupts the process of getting new information into the memory system. This study investigated whether this negative impact could be reduced by having students use concepts stored in memory to practice what they have learned, instead of just rereading information they have already read in their textbook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The participants were 60 Portuguese-speaking undergraduate students (15 men, 45 women; mean age = 20.75) from Brazil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The researchers used three, approximately 700-word-long texts, from a popular scientific journal written in Portuguese. From these seven passages were selected for students to read. While reading, students were interrupted by 3 cell phone messages. Immediately after reading the selected text, students completed a task that differed based on one of three groups to which they were randomly assigned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 1:</span> Students read the selected passages while receiving 3 messages on their cell phone. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students reread the 7 passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 2:</span> Students read the selected passages while receiving 3 messages on their cell phone. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students answered 7 questions (short-answer recall) based on the passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 3 (control):</span> Students read the selected passages without distraction. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students answered 7 questions (short-answer recall) based on the passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">At the conclusion of this procedure, students in all groups were asked to report the extent to which they believed they would remember the content of the reading after one week. Researchers called this measurement the “judgment of learning,” or JOL. JOL was measured on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 (I will remember 0% of the text) to 10 (I will remember 100% of the text).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">After 7 days, students answered 21 questions drawn from the reading, including the practice items that Groups 2 and 3 had been exposed to previously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The researchers found, as predicted, that the percentage of correctly recalled answers after one week was lower after multitasking. This indicated a slight negative short-term effect of media multitasking. The researchers found a positive effect 1 week later in the groups that were presented with the practice questions after reading the text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants in Condition 1 recalled less information than those in Condition 2 and 3. However, against the researchers’ predictions, the latter two conditions led to equivalent success on the quiz given 7-days later. This suggests that the practice questions minimized the negative effects of media distractions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Retrieving previously encountered information such as taking the quiz in this procedure, is a critical factor for promoting long-term recall of information compared to rereading text passages. This advantageous effect occurred even when to-be-recalled information was entered into the memory system for the first time while distracted by media. In fact, against the researcher’s hypothesis, practice led to equivalent beneficial effects whether information was learned with or without attempting to do multiple things simultaneously.</p>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Ekuni, R., Macacare, O.T., and Pompeia, S.
