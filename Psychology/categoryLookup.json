Some theorists have sought to apply principles of the evolutionary perspective in ways that discriminate against others (eugenics).","400959":"1.1.A.3: Research on the effects of genes on individual behavior and mental processes is often conducted using twin studies, family studies, and adoption studies.","400960":"1.2: Overview of the Nervous System","400961":"1.2.A: Differentiate among the subsystems of the human nervous system and their functions.","400962":"1.2.A.1: The central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord and interacts with all processes in the body.","400963":"1.2.A.2: The peripheral nervous system relays messages from the central nervous system to the rest of the body and includes the autonomic and somatic nervous systems.<ol type=\"i\" start=\"1\"><li>The autonomic nervous system governs processes that are involuntary and includes the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems.</li></ol><ol type=\"i\" start=\"2\"><li>The somatic nervous system governs processes that are voluntary.</li></ol>","400964":"1.3: The Neuron and Neural Firing","400965":"1.3.A: Explain how the structures and functions of typical neurons in the central nervous system affect behavior and mental processes.","400966":"1.3.A.1: Two common types of neural cells in the brain are neurons (neural cells that transmit information) and glial cells (cells that provide structure, insulation, communication, and waste transport). These types of cells form the basis of the nervous system and are the building blocks of all behavior and mental processes.","400967":"1.3.A.2: In the spinal cord, the reflex arc demonstrates how neurons within the central and peripheral nervous systems work together to respond to stimuli.

Neurotransmitters generally communicate either excitatory (making an action potential more likely) or inhibitory (making an action potential less likely) messages. Neurotransmitters related to behavior and mental processes for study in AP Psychology are limited to dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, glutamate, GABA, endorphins, substance p, and acetylcholine.","400971":"1.3.B.3: Outside of the nervous system, hormones perform actions similar to neurotransmitters.

Early 20th century psychological theories of emotion parsed the distinction between the physiological and cognitive experiences of emotion. Some theories proposed that the physiological and cognitive experiences occurred in succession while others proposed that they occurred simultaneously. Other theories emphasize that the cognitive label is required to experience an emotion.
