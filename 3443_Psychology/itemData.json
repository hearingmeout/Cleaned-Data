Most pain-related concerns are addressed using biological therapies such as psychoactive drugs. A growing interest in finding non-biological approaches to pain management led researchers to explore studies that used group therapy as an alternative approach for people experiencing chronic pain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><strong><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\">Participants</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The researchers combined and analyzed findings from 29 peer-reviewed articles that presented studies on the use of group therapy to treat pain. Collectively, the studies included approximately 4,571 participants with an average age of 53.1 years old. Seventy-eight percent of participants were women, and 22% were men.<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf1aa12a1e8e847aeb4e1cc2034dbaad5\" id=\"reff1aa12a1e8e847aeb4e1cc2034dbaad5\">1</a></sup></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Most of the studies did not include other demographic information about the participants, but all of the studies were conducted in English-speaking nations. All of the studies included were approved by a committee of professionals to ensure the appropriateness of the study, and participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time. The researchers maintained the data in a way that would prevent participant information from being known.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><strong><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\">Method</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The researchers included studies that examined group therapy as an effective approach to pain management if those studies met the following conditions:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Used random assignment to groups with a manipulated independent variable&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Were published between 1990 and 2020</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Involved participants who were diagnosed with or treated for fibromyalgia<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3c9ac99f7128407096a3785e0410bcf2\" id=\"ref3c9ac99f7128407096a3785e0410bcf2\">2</a></sup></span>, chronic pain, and/or specific pain&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Measured changes in pain intensity before and after group therapy that used a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Used a “treatment-as-usual” or wait-listed control group&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Included at least 20 participants who completed the group therapy and related assessments&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p class=\"dap_body\">Included groups that met at least three times face-to-face for group therapy&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Most of the studies focused on fibromyalgia or other, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. Other types of pain reported by participants included chronic back pain, arthritis, combined back and neck pain, cancer-related pain, and headaches or migraines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">All of the studies examined the effectiveness of group therapy on pain management. Twelve of the groups had one person lead the sessions, and ten of the groups had more than one person lead the sessions. The most common treatment approach was cognitive-behavioral therapy (17 out of 29 studies). Sessions lasted an average of 120 minutes, with an average of 9 sessions offered per study. Most groups consisted of between 5 and 10 people (reported by 18 of the 29 studies).</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><strong><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\">Results and Discussion</span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The overall effect size of group therapy on reducing pain intensity was small. However, the researchers found significant improvements in patients’ outcomes aside from a reduction in pain intensity, patients reporting decreases in pain interference with their lives, patients thinking their pain is not the worst possible outcome (catastrophizing), and patients’ improved perceptions of pain, anxiety, depression, and barriers to physical functioning. The patients’ improvements remained consistent in long-term follow-ups lasting up to a year. These findings suggest that group therapy helps people who experience chronic pain by lessening their perception of pain intensity rather than alleviating their pain intensity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Researchers also found that group therapy was more effective for women who participated in women-only groups than for women who participated in mixed-gendered groups. According to the researchers, groups that used cognitive-behavioral therapy appeared to be less effective at addressing pain management than groups that used other approaches to therapy (e.g., behavioral therapy). The researchers speculated that since cognitive-behavioral therapy is less focused on building group cohesion, it may not be the best approach for group therapy that addresses pain management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Based on their findings, the researchers concluded that group therapy may be more effective than biological therapies in treating some pain-related concerns.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_sourceattribution\">Alldredge, C., Muñiz, V., &amp; Henderson, T.

As the participants in this group described the trauma they experienced, the therapist customized the virtual reality to mirror their descriptions. Along with the headset, participants wore headphones that introduced sounds associated with the traumas the soldiers described (e.g., gunfire). Special speakers also produced vibrations under the soldiers’ feet. Finally, smells associated with traumas were introduced into the environment. As they experienced the virtual reality simulation, the participants practiced controlled breathing techniques and engaged in cognitive and emotional processing of the experience with their therapist.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The study lasted for five weeks. Participants in the two exposure groups received 10 therapy sessions that lasted 1.5 to 2 hours each. After the five-week study concluded, soldiers in the waitlisted group were provided with therapy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Study data were collected by clinicians who were blind to the participants’ treatment groups. The researchers collected data on the following study measures:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>PTSD symptoms, using a structured interview that measured the number and severity of PTSD symptoms and a PTSD symptom severity survey with a 17-item checklist that used 5-point Likert scales</li>\n\t<li>Levels of depression, using a 21-item depression inventory that used 4-point Likert scales</li>\n\t<li>Levels of anxiety, using a 21-item anxiety inventory that also used 4-point Likert scales&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Higher scores on these scales indicated more, or more severe, PTSD symptoms and higher levels of depression and anxiety, respectively. Measures were taken before treatment, at the midpoint of the treatment (2.5 weeks), and at the end of treatment (5 weeks).</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">At the beginning of the study, the three groups of participants did not differ significantly from each other in terms of PTSD symptoms and severity, levels of depression, or levels of anxiety.

In this study, the researchers examined whether adolescents who experience puberty sooner than their peers also experience higher levels of depressive symptoms later in adolescence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Participants</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">From 1989 through 1995, researchers gathered data from 451 families from eight counties in a state in the midwestern United States. The researchers invited the families to participate in the study by calling or mailing a letter. When the study began, these families included 236 girls and 215 boys in the seventh grade<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8f8902cf20014b51a9e277d49aa71c9f\" id=\"ref8f8902cf20014b51a9e277d49aa71c9f\">1</a></sup></span>. To be eligible to participate, the seventh grader had to live with both biological parents and have a sibling that was within four years of their age. Data were collected over six years, and most families (406 of 451) participated in every phase of data collection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Most participating families identified as middle- to lower-middle income. All participants identified as white<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb35e8077369a44c0b87e7f68dcb0aa3d\" id=\"refb35e8077369a44c0b87e7f68dcb0aa3d\">2</a></sup></span>&nbsp;families who lived in towns or small cities (54%), on farms (34%), or in non-farm rural areas (12%). The median family size was five members, and the median family income was $33,700. Each member in every family indicated that they knew they were in a research study and could withdraw at any time without penalty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Each year for six consecutive years, the researchers visited the families at home to conduct an annual two-hour interview and for families to complete a series of questionnaires. In addition to these annual interviews, the adolescents within the families completed several questionnaires. Symptoms of depression were measured with 12 of the questionnaire items that used five-point Likert scales. Participants indicated the extent to which they had experienced various affective or cognitive symptoms of depression (e.g., low energy) in the previous week, with higher scores indicating more symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Participants also provided data related to their experience with puberty, including when they started puberty (early, on-time, or late development) and their pubertal status at the time of the interview. Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected.&nbsp;Pubertal status measured the extent to which participants had completed several developmental indicators of puberty during the previous year (e.g., voice changes, growth spurt). Higher Likert scale ratings indicated that the participant had experienced more pubertal indicators.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Overall, the researchers found that girls experienced more depressive symptoms in the eighth grade than did boys. Additionally, girls experienced more depressive symptoms in the tenth through twelfth grades than they did in the seventh grade. Although boys experienced increased depressive symptoms during the tenth grade, their symptoms never exceeded what they reported in the seventh grade. These findings suggest that the gender difference in depressive symptoms persisted over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Pubertal status in the seventh grade predicted depressive symptoms over time for girls more than for boys. Girls who developed puberty early reported more depressive symptoms later in adolescence than did girls who developed puberty on time or late. Boys’ depressive symptoms did not differ significantly based on onset of puberty or pubertal status.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_copyright\">Ge, X., Conger, R. D., &amp; Elder Jr., G. H. (2001).

The data are shown in the tables.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line\">Table 1: Group 1 Mood Stability

aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Researchers from a university in New York measured four factors during this study:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">1. &nbsp;Family environment was measured using the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS) which evaluates the level of family disorganization and chaos (called environmental confusion). Environmental confusion is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from “definitely untrue” to “definitely true.” Higher scores indicated higher levels of chaos in the family environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">2. &nbsp;Daily sleep quality was self-reported by the adolescents using a 4-item survey each morning for 7 consecutive days. This survey measured overall sleep quality (1 = very restless to 5 = very sound); sleep latency (approximate number of minutes before falling asleep); how rested participants were (1 = exhausted to 5 = very refreshed); and number of wake-after-sleep episodes. Higher scores indicated better sleep quality.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">3. Daily sleep duration was calculated for each day by finding the difference between the time the adolescent reported going to sleep and their reported waking time the next morning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">4. Daily psychological functioning was self-reported by the adolescents in a survey. Two items assessed anxiety symptoms, and two items assessed depressive symptoms using a 4-point scale (1 = not at all to 4 = nearly all day). Higher scores indicated higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The baseline survey completed by all participants also included the following measurements: parents’ use of inconsistent discipline, child age and gender, adolescent-reported daily daytime naps (in minutes), school start time, and family socioeconomic status (SES).</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Participants used an online survey platform to complete a morning diary survey (e.g., sleep-related measures). Each entry was time-stamped, and researchers asked participants to complete the morning diary survey within an hour of waking up and to complete the evening diary survey within an hour before going to sleep. &nbsp;A total of 186 adolescents (96.4%) completed at least 2 days of the daily diaries, and 178 adolescents (92.2%) completed at least 4 days of the daily diaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">All participants were paid $10 for completing the baseline survey. Adolescents were compensated $15 for completing at least 4 days of the sleep diary. The study was approved by group of professionals to determine the appropriateness of the study, and both parents and adolescent participants agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Family chaos did not predict adolescents’ sleep duration, according to this study. When comparing each participant’s sleep duration with their anxiety and depressive symptoms, researchers found that sleep duration did predict those symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; .05)<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fn631a0f37b53c405e957bcc89688437f4\" id=\"ref631a0f37b53c405e957bcc89688437f4\">1</a></sup></span>. <span>Longer sleep durations from the previous night that were reported in the morning were associated with less anxiety and depressive symptoms reported later that evening. </span>This association emerged after controlling for average levels of sleep duration and average levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms for each participant. However, when comparing one participant to another participant, researchers found that sleep duration did not predict anxiety and depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Family chaos significantly predicted adolescents’ sleep quality such that more chaotic and disorganized family environments were associated with lower levels of sleep quality (<i>p</i> &lt; .05), according to this study. When comparing each participant’s sleep quality with their anxiety and depressive symptoms, researchers found that better sleep quality significantly predicted a negative association with adolescents’ anxiety and depressive symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; .01). <span>Better quality sleep from the previous night that was reported in the morning was associated with fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms reported later that evening.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">This association was also significant when comparing participants to one another (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), suggesting that higher levels of sleep quality for an adolescent across the morning diaries predicted lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms for that adolescent across the evening diaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_sourceattribution\">Adapted from American Psychological Association.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_sourceattribution\"><span>O’Connor, T.G., Peltz, J.S., &amp; Rogge, R.D.

Of those who received the invitation, almost 4,000 participants agreed to participate and were accepted. To be accepted, participants had to be over 65 years of age if women and over 60 years of age if men. In addition, they could not participate if they had ever had a stroke, if they had received a cancer diagnosis in the two years before the study, or if they had a history of any other serious illnesses.

Participants in Group 1 received a pack of multivitamins each month by mail and were instructed to take one pill twice a day.

From that study’s sample, over 7,000 people received a mailed invitation to participate in this study. Of those who received the invitation, almost 4,000 participants agreed to participate and were accepted. To be accepted, participants had to be over 65 years of age if women and over 60 years of age if men. In addition, they could not participate if they had ever had a stroke, if they had received a cancer diagnosis in the two years before the study, or if they had a history of any other serious illnesses. Participants had to be able to communicate in English and had to have access to an Internet-connected computer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">A computer randomly assigned participants to two groups. Participants in Group 1 received a pack of multivitamins each month by mail and were instructed to take one pill twice a day.

After completing several complex math problems, participants were told that they could choose either a toaster or a microwave as a prize for participating in the study. After selecting their prize, participants were asked to rate the desirability of both items again.

This view of recovery focuses on social causes of substance use and abuse, such as poverty, physical or emotional abuse in one’s home, or homelessness, and teaching people how to deal with those stressors through more healthful ways of thinking and behaving. The women participated in four group interviews over a six-month period that were recorded and transcribed word-for-word. Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected.&nbsp;A team of three researchers analyzed the recordings and transcripts. Researchers developed a code manual that “organized the data for accurate interpretation” across all three researchers. Researchers first developed a list of codes that corresponded to common aspects of successful recovery programs. Then, as the responses were read, the researchers would categorize each response with an existing code. Researchers would add a new code for each new topic the participants brought up in their responses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Four major themes for successful recovery programs emerged from the participants’ responses based on the most frequently occurring codes:</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Knowledge of addiction as a disease – Participants shared that they did not often realize that their substance use could be classified as an addiction. The researchers coded participant responses that referenced overuse or “abusive” use of substances as indications of addiction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Importance of social support and support groups – Participants shared the importance of three main kinds of social support: 1) family and friend support; 2) organized support groups, and 3) support from other participants in the recovery program. Attending support groups while living in the recovery program helped women develop positive support and broke down barriers to recovery like lack of transportation, childcare, or accountability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Peace of mind that comes from a new lifestyle – Participants shared that while their lives were not stress-free, they felt a sense of peace by not using substances. The participants reported that being in the program taught them ways to reconsider their responses to stress more effectively, leading to a sense of peace instead of turmoil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Desire to maintain recovery – Many participants reported that they wanted to maintain their new substance-free lifestyles. One participant reported that “I’m going to do whatever it is I have to do to make sure that we [she and her child] don’t ever have to go back to that [being homeless and abusing substances].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">After categorizing the responses from the participants into these four categories, the researchers believe that the participants’ responses show that the program had a positive impact on the participants’ recovery. The researchers recommend that programs follow a similar model of recovery to improve outcomes for women experiencing substance use disorders.</p>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology</span>.</span><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Krueger, E., Deal, E., Lopez.

Researchers conducted two experiments to determine how much interference the color of the letters of the word affected people’s ability to identify either the word or the color of the letters (e.g., the Stroop task).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 1: 70 college undergraduates participated (14 men and 56 women).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 2: 100 students participated (88 undergraduates; 29 men and 59 women) and 12 graduate students (all women).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 1 tested how quickly participants could read the names of colors. The researcher used two sets of color-name stimuli in this study. The first set of color names (red, blue, green, brown, and purple) was printed in black ink.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The second set of color names (also red, blue, green, brown, and purple) was printed in a different color than the name of the color. No word in this set was printed in the color it named, but it was printed an equal number of times in each of the other four colors (e.g., the word “red” was printed in blue, green, brown, and purple inks; the word “blue” was printed in red, green, brown, and purple inks, etc.). Participants were to read the words in each list as fast as they could, ignoring the color of the ink in which the word was printed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Experiment 2 tested how quickly participants could identify the color of the stimulus they were seeing. He used two sets of stimuli for this study. The first set of stimuli printed solid squares in each of the colors used in Experiment 1 (red, blue, green, brown, and purple). In the second set of stimuli, the words were again printed in a color that did not match the name of the color, as described in Experiment 1. Participants were to say the color of the square or of the letters in the word, ignoring the colors named by the words (e.g., where the word “red” was printed in blue ink, the correct response was “blue,” etc.).</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a diagram of two experiments. Experiment 1 shows the following list of colors presented horizontally from left to right: Purple, Brown, Red, Blue, and Green. The word for each color is presented twice, first in black text and then in a different color text, as follows: the word Purple is red, the word Brown is blue, the word Red is green, the word Blue is brown, and the word Green is purple. Experiment two shows one block for each of the colors listed in experiment 1.

This research examined associations between students’ attitudes toward in-class device use and learning outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were 187 undergraduate students (63.1% women, 36.9% men; mean age = 20.7 years; standard deviation for age = 5.1; range of ages: 17 to 46) at a large urban public university in the northeastern United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Many students at the college are considered nontraditional based on age and other criteria (e.g., employment, financial independence). In line with the National Center for Education Statistics (2002, 2020), which uses age 24 years and older as an index of nontraditional undergraduate student status, we categorized students in our sample as traditional (ages 17–23 years; number of participants = 164; mode age of 18 years) or nontraditional (ages 24–46 years; number of participants = 23; mode age of 24 years).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Over the course of the semester, students completed the following online assignments and surveys:</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Attitudes toward in-class use of personal devices:</span> This six-item survey was given only in Week 2 of the course at the beginning of the semester to assess student attitudes about in-class use of personal mobile devices in relation to learning (“I like to be able to use a personal mobile device during class time”) and whether instructors should permit such usage (“Students should be allowed to use personal mobile devices in the classroom to support their learning”). Participant responded using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Concentrating and multitasking while completing schoolwork online:</span> Also in Week 2, students were asked about their ability to concentrate online (“To what extent do you find it hard to concentrate and stay on task when completing course work online?”) and their multitasking behaviors (“To what extent do you multitask [e.g., watch TV or YouTube, check social media, etc.] while completing course work online?”). Participants responded using a 5-point scale (For the questions concerning concentration: “1 = very hard to concentrate, 3 = neither hard nor easy to concentrate, 5 = very easy to concentrate” For the questions concerning frequency of multitasking: “1 = very infrequently, 3 = neutral, 5 = very frequently”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Multiple-choice quizzes:</span> Multiple-choice quizzes were embedded in the online homework assignments administered during Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Each quiz contained 16 to 21 four-option multiple-choice questions on material from class lectures and used as review materials for upcoming tests. Quiz scores (% correct) were averaged across the three homework assignments and used as a measure of learning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">End-of-semester technology- and nontechnology-related distractibility:</span> A three-item survey asked students to report the extent to which they were distracted by behaviors related to their own use of personal mobile devices (e.g., laptop, cell phone, tablet, etc.) in course-related contexts (“when completing online assignments, “when reading the textbook,” and “when attending the course”) and by nontechnology-related distractions (“people arriving late,” and “people around them chatting”). Participants responded using a 3-point scale for both contexts (“1 = not distracted, 2 = somewhat distracted, and 3 = very distracted”).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Students held neutral to positive views of in-class use of technology, and mostly agreed that instructors should permit their use. For the question “To what extent do you find it hard to concentrate and stay on task when completing course work online?”, most students held a neutral position but leaned toward saying it was somewhat easy to concentrate while studying online (mean = 3.42; standard deviation = 1.04).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In response to the question “To what extent do you multitask (e.g., watch TV or YouTube, check social media, etc.) while completing course work online?”, most students held a neutral view, indicating they multitasked neither frequently nor infrequently (mean = 3.14; standard deviation = 1.22). Researchers failed to find age-related differences in attitudes toward in-class technology use, although they found younger students reported higher rates of multitasking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Age had a negative correlation with students’ self-reported multitasking and a positive correlation with quiz scores. Students’ multitasking tendencies were positively correlated with their attitudes about personal use of mobile devices in class. There was a strong positive correlation between attitudes about the amount of personal device use and how much mobile devices should be permitted in class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Nontraditional students were less likely to report that they multitask online, and they also tended to perform better on the quizzes. However, these two variables (the extent to multitasking while online and quiz performance) were not significantly correlated with each other. Thus, researchers failed to find evidence that multitasking tendencies were on their own predictive of poor learning outcomes or associated with heightened distractibility.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">There was a statistically significant relationship between better student performance on quizzes and lower self-reported level of distraction using personal mobile devices.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Ober, T.

This practice impairs their academic achievement. This problem gets worse when students take online classes where they cannot be directly monitored by a teacher. Prior research has demonstrated that this tendency to do many things at once impairs our ability to recall information because it disrupts the process of getting new information into the memory system. This study investigated whether this negative impact could be reduced by having students use concepts stored in memory to practice what they have learned, instead of just rereading information they have already read in their textbook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The participants were 60 Portuguese-speaking undergraduate students (15 men, 45 women; mean age = 20.75) from Brazil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The researchers used three, approximately 700-word-long texts, from a popular scientific journal written in Portuguese. From these seven passages were selected for students to read. While reading, students were interrupted by 3 cell phone messages. Immediately after reading the selected text, students completed a task that differed based on one of three groups to which they were randomly assigned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 1:</span> Students read the selected passages while receiving 3 messages on their cell phone. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students reread the 7 passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 2:</span> Students read the selected passages while receiving 3 messages on their cell phone. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students answered 7 questions (short-answer recall) based on the passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Condition 3 (control):</span> Students read the selected passages without distraction. After doing a 2-minute distraction task, students answered 7 questions (short-answer recall) based on the passages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">At the conclusion of this procedure, students in all groups were asked to report the extent to which they believed they would remember the content of the reading after one week. Researchers called this measurement the “judgment of learning,” or JOL. JOL was measured on a 10-point scale, ranging from 1 (I will remember 0% of the text) to 10 (I will remember 100% of the text).</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">After 7 days, students answered 21 questions drawn from the reading, including the practice items that Groups 2 and 3 had been exposed to previously.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The researchers found, as predicted, that the percentage of correctly recalled answers after one week was lower after multitasking. This indicated a slight negative short-term effect of media multitasking. The researchers found a positive effect 1 week later in the groups that were presented with the practice questions after reading the text.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants in Condition 1 recalled less information than those in Condition 2 and 3. However, against the researchers’ predictions, the latter two conditions led to equivalent success on the quiz given 7-days later. This suggests that the practice questions minimized the negative effects of media distractions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Retrieving previously encountered information such as taking the quiz in this procedure, is a critical factor for promoting long-term recall of information compared to rereading text passages. This advantageous effect occurred even when to-be-recalled information was entered into the memory system for the first time while distracted by media. In fact, against the researcher’s hypothesis, practice led to equivalent beneficial effects whether information was learned with or without attempting to do multiple things simultaneously.</p>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Adapted from Ekuni, R., Macacare, O.T., and Pompeia, S.

Evidence from prior studies suggests that being in a messy environment increases one’s ability to come up with more creative solutions with less reliance on preexisting ways of viewing the world. This study investigated the effect of messy work environments on creativity and these higher-level cognitive processes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">One hundred volunteers participated in the study (age: mean 22.89 years, standard deviation = 5.19, 69% women, 31% men, 81% right-handed, 19% left-handed).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Methods</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained prior to participation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were randomly assigned to two adjacent classrooms; one classroom was tidy, and the other was messy. All participants first completed the Alternative Uses Task, in which they generated up to 10 unusual uses for an automobile tire in 5 minutes. Two raters measured the creativity of each participant on a 5-point scale (5 = higher creativity; 1 = lower creativity) by considering how commonplace, unusual, and clever the participant’s responses were. When the ratings of the independent raters were compared on their creativity scores, they were highly correlated.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">To measure cognitive processing, participants completed additional tests. In one test, called a digit span task, participants were given a series of numbers and asked to repeat back what they had heard. In each subsequent trial a longer sequence of numbers was presented. The longest remembered sequence was the measure of the participant’s digit span. Researchers also included a letter fluency test, in which participants were given 1 minute to produce as many unique words as possible starting with a given letter, either “L” or “F.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were debriefed and compensated with either a $20.00 gift card or extra credit for their introductory psychology course at the completion of the study.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers compared the creativity and cognitive processing measures between the tidy and messy conditions.

This difference was statistically significant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers concluded that an orderly environment could have a positive influence on individuals’ self-control behaviors. However, this applied only to those with low trait self-control. In contrast, a disorderly environment can be beneficial to creative thinking, but this applied mostly for individuals with high trait self-control. The findings are represented in the graph.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a bar graph.

Research with split-brain patients indicates that the processing of music is done more by the right hemisphere of the brain while language is processed more by the left hemisphere. Some research with split-brain patients also indicates that the processing of music can help with the processing of language, a phenomenon called the tonal function effect. This study explores whether this effect can be found in healthy listeners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Right-handed college students with less than 3 years of music training were used for this study. None of the participants had any hearing impairments. The study included 48 participants (25 women; 23 men) with an average age of 21 years (standard deviation = 3.67).</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Method</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers used a within-subjects design for this study. A within-subjects design means that each participant is observed in every condition of the study and therefore can be compared directly to themselves. This procedure serves the same purpose as random assignment. Participants were exposed to two different types of sounds at a safe decibel<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">1</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Decibels measure how loud a sound is.</span></span> range, one in each ear, and asked to correctly provide a specific detail about one of the sounds as they listened.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Spoken consonant-vowel syllables were the first type of sound. There were 12 sequences of 8 syllables, with the eighth syllable of each sequence being either /di/ or /du/. Musical chords were the second type of sound. There were 12 sequences of 8 chords, with the eighth chord of each sequence being called either Timbre A or Timbre B<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">2</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Timbre, or the characteristic of a sound, allows the listener to distinguish different sounds from each other.</span></span>. Participants were asked to identify either the last spoken syllable (/di/ or /du/) or the last chord (Timbre A or Timbre B). Timbre A was a chord that was “tonal,” meaning it was what a person would expect to come based on the previous chords in the sequence. Timbre B was a chord that was “subdominant,” meaning it would not be a chord a person would expect based on the previous chords in the sequence. The participants practiced identifying the syllables and chords prior to the start of the study. They had to identify the correct sound with 92% accuracy before moving on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants completed 96 trials for the study. The breakdown of the ways the sounds were presented in each ear is presented in the table below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:3\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col2 colnum:2\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col3 colnum:3\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">Timbre A</th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">Timbre B</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">/di/</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">48 – left ear</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">48 – right ear</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">/du/</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">48 – right ear</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">48 – left ear</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The participants were told which sound to identify (syllable vs. chord) about halfway through the playing of the sounds in both ears.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers hypothesized that “the tonal function effect would be stronger when musical sequences were presented to the left ear and speech sequences were presented to the right ear.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Overall, participants were, on average, 97% accurate for spoken syllable identification and 86% accurate for timbre identification.

The company has just developed a new skateboard, Model B. Company executives want to test whether customers who have already used Model A will be able to learn more quickly to skateboard using Model B as compared to those who have no experience. The company’s research team recruits 50 participants for their study and randomly assigns them to two groups. Group 1 is given 3 weeks of skateboarding lessons using the Model A skateboard.

They were informed that a computer would randomly assign them to an activity, that it might change from week to week, and that some would not be assigned any activity for the duration of the study. Participants were instructed to keep their activities confidential and focus only on completing their assignments to the best of their abilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: Givers (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"19\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"19\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>19</mn></math></span></span> participants), Receivers (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"35\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>35</mn></math></span></span> participants) and Controls (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"34\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"34\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>34</mn></math></span></span> participants). No participants were aware of their group assignment. Thus, Receivers were not aware that Givers had been assigned to do acts of kindness on their behalf.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Givers were instructed to perform five acts of kindness in one day for recipients on a specific list. They were allowed to choose the specific kinds of activities they did, when they performed them, and whom they chose from their randomized lists of Receivers. Some examples were provided to help them select activities, such as “bringing someone a beverage” or “emailing a thank-you note.” This process was repeated each week for the four weeks of the study, and each Giver was provided a new list of Receivers to select from during each week. Neither Receivers nor Controls performed any other activity assignments throughout the study.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">All participants logged into the study website every week for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"4\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math></span></span> weeks to complete surveys that measured happiness and life satisfaction, depression symptoms, and job satisfaction.

At the one-month follow-up, Givers showed statistically significant increases in life satisfaction and job satisfaction and decreases in depressive symptoms. Increases in happiness measures were also observed in Givers, though they were not statistically significant. Receivers showed increases in happiness that were statistically significant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">A full month after Givers finished practicing their acts of kindness, the long-term benefits remained, and they were strongest for Givers themselves. The study’s results indicate that acts of kindness produce improvements in well-being for both Givers and Receivers, though Givers benefit more.

Media screens include televisions, computers, tablets, and smartphones. Parents and caregivers may wonder about the relationship between their children paying attention to media screens and the cognitive changes that are described in developmental theories. This research study examined when infants first experienced media screens, how often they were exposed to media screens, and their later cognitive development. The researchers also considered mothers’ education levels and verbal interactions with their infants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Participants</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The researchers tracked <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"274\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"274\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>274</mn></math></span></span> mothers and their infant participants when the infants were at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"6\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"6\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>6</mn></math></span></span>, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"12\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"12\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>12</mn></math></span></span>, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"18\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"18\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>18</mn></math></span></span>, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"24\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"24\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>24</mn></math></span></span>, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"36\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"36\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>36</mn></math></span></span>, and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"48\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"48\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>48</mn></math></span></span> months of age.

The participant then went to another room for the remainder of the study. The “learners” gave correct and incorrect responses according to a predetermined schedule. After participants pressed the 75-volt switch, they heard a small grunt from the “learner.” The grunts got louder after each successive shock. When a participant pressed the 150-volt switch, the “learner” yelled, “Ugh. Get me out of here. I told you I had heart trouble. My heart’s starting to bother me now. I refuse to go on. Let me out.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">If the participant expressed reluctance or hesitation at any time, the researcher gave one of four directions, in this order: “Please continue”; “The research requires that you continue”; “It is absolutely essential that you continue”; and “You have no other choice, you must continue.” The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The base condition ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In the <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">modeled refusal condition</span>, the procedures were the same as the base condition except for an additional confederate who was paired with each participant. The men were paired with a White man in his 50s. Women were paired with a White woman in her late 20s. The researcher pretended to randomly choose the participant to be Teacher 2 and the additional confederate to be Teacher 1. Teacher 1 administered shocks to the “learner” according to the procedures as the participant watched. At the 90-volt shock level, Teacher 1 said to the researcher, “I don’t know about this.” The researcher responded with “Please continue.” Teacher 1 paused and then said, “I don’t think I can do this,” and pushed their chair from the table. The researcher then asked Teacher 2 (the participant) to continue the test, picking up where Teacher 1 left off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">As with the base condition, if the participant (Teacher 2) expressed reluctance or hesitation, the researcher gave one of the four directions as described. The researcher assessed whether the participants continued to administer shocks after receiving each direction. The modeled refusal condition also ended when the participant refused to continue or agreed to continue at the shock level just past 150 volts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">When the study was over, the researcher explained informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete, specifically that the “learner” was not receiving electric shocks. The “learner” entered the lab room at that point to assure the participant that they were fine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Results and Discussion</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Number (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:4\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:left colname:col1 colnum:1 colwidth:160\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col4 colnum:4\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Behavior</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Base Condition</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Modeled Refusal Condition</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\"> Milgram’s Original Study</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">12 (30%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">11 (36.7%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">7 (17.5%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">28 (70%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">19 (63.3%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4 text-center\">33 (82.5%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Numbers (and Percentages) of Participants Who Stopped and Who Continued, By Gender</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:3\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:left colname:col1 colnum:1 colwidth:160\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<thead class=\"thead\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Condition and Behavior</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Men</span></th>\n\t\t\t<th class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic font_weight:bold\">Women</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Base condition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">6 (33.3%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">6 (27.3%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">12 (66.7%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">16 (72.7%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">Modeled Refusal Condition</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped at 150 volts or earlier</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">5 (45.5%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">6 (31.6%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 text-center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued after 150 volts</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 text-center\">6 (54.5%)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3 text-center\">13 (68.4%)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Burger, J.M.

Each pair comprised a mother and her two-year-old child. The average age of the mothers was 35.26 years (age range = 29.53 to 47.10 years; 19 mothers did not report their age). All the two-year-old children were developing along standard physical, social, and emotional timelines. The average age of the children was 27.05 months (2.25 years), and an equal number of boys and girls participated. All mother-child pairs lived in suburban communities surrounding the same major East Coast United States city; 90.9% of families self-identified as white while the remaining 9.10% self-identified as Hispanic, Pacific Islander, African American, or multiethnic.<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbce6caffd46e4685adbb1f85895f7b8b\" id=\"refbce6caffd46e4685adbb1f85895f7b8b\">1</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Mothers agreed to be in the study and knew they could withdraw from participation at any time.&nbsp;Researchers ensured that the individual participants could not be identified from the data collected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Method</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">At the beginning of the study, mothers and their children were placed in separate rooms. The children played in a supervised, child-friendly room. Meanwhile, in a separate room, the researchers trained the mothers regarding the meaning of two completely new words: <i>blicking</i> (meaning a type of bouncing) and <i>frepping</i> (meaning a type of shaking). The researchers made up these words and their meanings for the purpose of this study. To demonstrate <i>blicking</i> to their child, each mother was provided an 18-inch gender-neutral<span class=\"footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#fn551ee5b9d6974393bf9bd39b03fa6429\" id=\"ref551ee5b9d6974393bf9bd39b03fa6429\">2</a></sup></span>&nbsp;doll. To demonstrate <i>frepping</i> to their child, each mother could shake a 6-inch rattle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">After providing each mother with a phone, which had been set to vibrate mode, the researchers trained each mother on how to answer the phone. The researchers told each mother to expect occasional phone calls during the study. During each call, the researchers provided one of three directions to the mother: 1) begin teaching the new word (teaching phase), 2) move to the next word (transition phase), or 3) engage in a conversation with the researcher as if talking with a friend (interruption phase).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">To initiate the teaching phase, the researchers called each mother and told her to teach the designated word to her child. Half of the mothers were told to teach <i>blicking</i> first while the other half were told to teach <i>frepping</i> first. The researchers interrupted half of the mothers while the mothers taught their first word and then interrupted the second half of the mothers while the mothers taught their second word. For the uninterrupted teaching phase, each mother received a transition call from a researcher that instructed her to start teaching the identified word. The mother then had 60 seconds to teach the word to her child.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">Figure 1 and Figure 2 depict the research design for the teaching phase, the transition phase, and the interruption phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image qti-align-center\"><img alt=\"A within-subjects design diagram titled Figure 1: Teaching Sequence in Interruption-First Condition.

During the interrupted teaching phase, the researchers and the mother talked about morning coffee routines for about 30 seconds. After about 30 seconds, the researchers instructed the mother to continue teaching her child the assigned word. Each mother had an additional 30 seconds to teach the word.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The researchers counted how many times the mothers used the words<i> blicking </i>or <i>frepping </i>during the instruction sessions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">After receiving instruction on <i>blicking</i> and <i>frepping</i>, each child sat in their mother’s lap and watched a video. The video began with an attention-getting image in the center of the screen (an image of a laughing baby) followed by the instruction to “Find [<i>blicking</i> or <i>frepping</i>].” The video then transitioned to a scene in which a puppet demonstrated the appropriate action for each word (bouncing for <i>blicking</i> and shaking for <i>frepping</i>) or demonstrated an unrelated action (twisting side to side or putting a hand on a box while standing up). Researchers measured how long the children paid attention to the action in the video to determine whether the children learned <i>blicking</i> or <i>frepping</i>. The mothers closed their eyes during the video to avoid accidentally cueing the children to pay attention to the correct action in the video.&nbsp;Researchers informed participants of the true purpose of the study after the study was complete.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\"><span aria-level=\"3\" class=\"selected-document-header\" role=\"heading\"><strong>Results and Discussion</strong></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">On average, the mothers repeated the word approximately 24 times in the interrupted teaching phase and approximately 20 times in the uninterrupted teaching phase. The difference was not statistically significant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_body\">The children paid attention to the word they learned in the uninterrupted session for an average of 0.63 seconds and in the interrupted session for an average of 0.50 seconds. The difference in means was statistically significant, suggesting that in-person interruptions between parent and child can affect how well young children learn vocabulary words.</p>\n\n<p class=\"dap_sourceattribution\">Reed.
