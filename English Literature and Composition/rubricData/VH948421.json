Whereas earlier units focus on how character is conveyed through textual detail, in Unit 3, students examine how those textual details can contribute to a reader’s interpretation of a character; this preparation should be useful to students as they approach this task. This passage features a complex interaction between two characters, and the interaction offers an abundance of details illustrating a character’s complex motivations.
