The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">*</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">haughty; superior</span></span> blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person’s lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one’s soul.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Ignatius himself was dressed comfortably and sensibly. The hunting cap prevented head colds. The voluminous tweed trousers were durable and permitted unusually free locomotion. Their pleats and nooks contained pockets of warm, stale air that soothed Ignatius. The plaid flannel shirt made a jacket unnecessary while the muffler guarded exposed Reilly skin between earflap and collar. The outfit was acceptable by any theological and geometrical standards, however abstruse, and suggested a rich inner life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Shifting from one hip to the other in his lumbering, elephantine fashion, Ignatius sent waves of flesh rippling beneath the tweed and flannel, waves that broke upon buttons and seams. Thus rearranged, he contemplated the long while that he had been waiting for his mother. Principally he considered the discomfort he was beginning to feel. It seemed as if his whole being was ready to burst from his swollen suede desert boots, and, as if to verify this, Ignatius turned his singular eyes toward his feet. The feet did indeed look swollen. He was prepared to offer the sight of those bulging boots to his mother as evidence of her thoughtlessness. Looking up, he saw the sun beginning to descend over the Mississippi at the foot of Canal Street. The Holmes clock said almost five. Already he was polishing a few carefully worded accusations designed to reduce his mother to repentance or, at least, confusion. He often had to keep her in her place.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission.</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">While Ignatius’ own thoughts and opinions indicate that he is an unusual person, the narrator’s description extends his unconventionality to being peculiar.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">While Ignatius presents himself as a wise and tasteful person, the narrator’s portrayal of the reactions of the people in the crowd around him reveal how unaware of his own limitations he is.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">While Ignatius’ attention is focused primarily on external appearances, the narrator is able to present a version of the story that focuses on characters’ inner lives.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">While Ignatius’ perspective is limited to events and details that he himself can observe, the narrator is able to provide information about details that Ignatius could not possibly know.</p>"],"answer":0}]
