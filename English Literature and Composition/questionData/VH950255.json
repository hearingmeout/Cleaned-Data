I’ve worn down</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>the soles and walked through the tightness</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>of my new shoes, calling upon the merchants,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">5&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>their offices bustling. All the while I kept thinking</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>my plain English and good writing would secure</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>for me some modest position. Though I dress each day</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>in my best, hands covered with the lace gloves</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>you crocheted—no one needs a <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">girl</span>. How flat</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;10</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>the word sounds, and heavy. My purse thins.</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I spend foolishly to make an appearance of quiet</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>industry, to mask the desperation that tightens</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>my throat. I sit watching—</span></div>\n\n<div class=\"verse\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>though I pretend not to notice—the dark maids</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;15</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>ambling by with their white charges. Do I deceive</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>anyone? Were they to see my hands, brown</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>as your dear face, they’d know I’m not quite</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>what I pretend to be. I walk these streets</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>a white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;20</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>of some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>a <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">negress</span> again. There are enough things here</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>to remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>the crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>the sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;25</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>at school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>their tongues in conversation, carrying their loads</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>on their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>and irons of the laundresses call to me. Here,</span></div>\n\n<div class=\"verse\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I thought not to do the work I once did, back-bending</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;30</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>and domestic; my schooling a gift—even those half days</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>at picking time, listening to Miss J—. How</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I’d come to know words, the recitations I practiced</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>to sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>or trailing off at the ends. I read my books until</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;35</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I repeated whole sections I’d learned by heart,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>spelling each word in my head to make a picture</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>I could see, as well as a weight I could feel</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"line_number badge badge-inverse\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>in my mouth.
