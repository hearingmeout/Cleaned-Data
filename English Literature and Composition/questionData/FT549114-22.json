At the door<br />\nThe milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell<br />\nProclaims the dustman’s office;<sup>2</sup> while the street<br />\nIs lost in clouds impervious.

Now the sun<br />\nDarts burning splendour on the glitt’ring pane,<br />\nSave where the canvas awning throws a shade<br />\nOn the gay merchandize. Now, spruce and trim,<br />\nIn shops (where beauty smiles with industry<br />\n<strong style=\"position:absolute; left: 0;\">(25)&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Sits the smart damsel; while the passenger<br />\nPeeps thro’ the window, watching ev’ry charm.<br />\nNow pastry dainties catch the eye minute<br />\nOf humming insects, while the limy snare<br />\nWaits to enthral them. Now the lamp-lighter<br />\n<strong style=\"position:absolute; left: 0;\">(30)&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Mounts the tall ladder, nimbly vent’rous,<br />\nTo trim the half-fill’d lamp; while at his feet<br />\nThe pot-boy<sup>4</sup> yells discordant! All along<br />\nThe sultry pavement, the old-clothes-man cries<br />\nIn tones monotonous, and side-long views<br />\n<strong style=\"position:absolute; left: 0;\">(35)&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The area for his traffic: now the bag<br />\nIs slily open’d, and the half-worn suit<br />\n(Sometimes the pilfer’d treasure of the base<br />\nDomestic spoiler), for one half its worth,<br />\nSinks in the green abyss. The porter now<br />\n<strong style=\"position:absolute; left: 0;\">(40)&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Bears his huge load along the burning way;<br />\nAnd the poor poet wakes from busy dreams,<br />\nTo paint the summer morning.</p>\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 35px;\">(1800)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 35px;\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><sup>1</sup>listen to<br />\n<sup>2</sup>work of the garbage collector<br />\n<sup>3</sup>hatbox<br />\n<sup>4</sup>drink server</span></p>\n"}]}]
