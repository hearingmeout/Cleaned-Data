He will be away all day; and so I will amuse myself with my neglected diary—if I can give that name to such an irregular composition. It is exactly four months since I opened it last.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">I am married now, and settled down as Mrs Huntingdon of Grassdale Manor. I have had eight weeks’ experience of matrimony. And do I regret the step I have taken?—No—though I must confess, in my secret heart, that Arthur is not what I thought him at first, and if I had known him in the beginning, as thoroughly as I do now, I probably never should have loved him, and if I loved him first, and then made the discovery, I fear I should have thought it my duty not to have married him. To be sure, I might have known him, for every one was willing enough to tell me about him, and he himself was no accomplished hypocrite, but I was wilfully blind, and now, instead of regretting that I did not discern his full character before I was indissolubly bound to him, I am <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">glad</span>; for it has saved me a great deal of battling with my conscience, and a great deal of consequent trouble and pain; and, whatever I <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">ought</span> to have done, my duty, now, is plainly to love him and to cleave to him; and this just tallies with my inclination.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">He is very fond of me—almost <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">too</span> fond. I could do with less caressing and more rationality: I should like to be less of a pet and more of a friend if I might choose—but I won’t complain of that: I am only afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains in ardour. I sometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches compared with one of solid coal,—very bright and hot, but if it should burn itself out and leave nothing but ashes behind, what shall I do? But it won’t—it <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">shan’t</span> I am determined—and surely I have power to keep it alive. So let me dismiss <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">that</span> thought at once. But Arthur is selfish—I am constrained to acknowledge that; and, indeed, the admission gives me less pain than might be expected, for, since <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">I</span> love him so much, I can easily forgive him for loving himself: he likes to be pleased, and it is my delight to please him—and when I regret this tendency of his, it is for his own sake, not for mine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour. He wanted to hurry it over, for all the Continental<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">1</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">European</span></span> scenes were already familiar to him: many had lost their interest in his eyes, and others had never had anything to lose. The consequence was, that, after a flying transit through part of France and part of Italy, I came back nearly as ignorant as I went, having made no acquaintance with persons and manners, and very little with things—my head swarming with motley confusion of objects and scenes—some, it is true, leaving a deeper and more pleasing impression than others, but these embittered by the recollection that my emotions had not been shared by my companion, but that, on the contrary, when I had expressed a particular interest in anything that I saw or desired to see, it had been displeasing to him in as much as it proved that I could take delight in anything disconnected with himself.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
