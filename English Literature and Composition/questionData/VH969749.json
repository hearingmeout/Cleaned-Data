Believing himself jilted by his first love, Muriel, RICHARD last night tried curing his wounds by staying out late and coming home to a worried family. Forbidden to leave the house, he is feeling embarrassed, depressed, and melodramatically pessimistic about life when his sister, MILDRED, enters.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(1) MILDRED: Hello! Are you allowed up?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(2) RICHARD: Of course, I’m allowed up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(3) MILDRED: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">comes and sits in her father’s chair at right, front, of table</span>] How did Pa punish you?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(4) RICHARD: He didn’t. He went back to the office without seeing me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(5) MILDRED: Well, you’ll catch it later. [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">then rebukingly</span>] And you ought to. If you’d ever seen how awful you looked last night!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(6) RICHARD: Ah, forget it, can’t you?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(7) MILDRED: Well, are you ever going to do it again, that’s what I want to know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(8) RICHARD: What’s that to you?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(9) MILDRED: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">with suppressed excitement</span>] Well, if you don’t solemnly swear you won’t—then I won’t give you something I’ve got for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(10) RICHARD: Don’t try to kid me. You haven’t got anything.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(11) MILDRED: I have, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(12) RICHARD: What?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(13) MILDRED: Wouldn’t you like to know! I’ll give you three guesses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(14) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">with disdainful dignity</span>] Don’t bother me. I’m in no mood to play riddles with kids!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(15) MILDRED: Oh, well, if you’re going to get snippy! Anyway, you haven’t promised yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(16) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">a prey to keen curiosity now</span>] I promise. What is it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(17) MILDRED: What would you like best in the world?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(18) RICHARD: I don’t know. What?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(19) MILDRED: And you pretend to be in love! If I told Muriel that!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(20) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">breathlessly</span>] Is it—from her?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(21) MILDRED: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">laughing</span>] Well, I guess it’s a shame to keep you guessing. Yes. It is from her. I was walking past her place just now when I saw her waving from their parlor window, and I went up and she said give this to Dick, and she didn’t have a chance to say anything else because her mother called her and said she wasn’t allowed to have company. So I took it—and here it is. [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">She gives him a letter folded many times into a tiny square. RICHARD opens it with a trembling eagerness and reads. MILDRED watches him curiously—then sighs affectedly.</span>] Gee, it must be nice to be in love like you are—all with one person.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(22) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">his eyes shining with joy</span>] Gee, Mid, do you know what she says—that she didn’t mean a word in that other letter. Her old man made her write it. And she loves me and only me and always will, no matter how they punish her!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(23) MILDRED: My! I’d never think she had that much spunk.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(24) RICHARD: Huh! You don’t know her! Think I could fall in love with a girl that was afraid to say her soul’s her own? I should say not! [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">then more gleefully still</span>] And she’s going to try and sneak out and meet me tonight. She says she thinks she can do it. [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">then suddenly feeling this enthusiasm before MILDRED is entirely the wrong note for a cynical pessimist—with an affected bitter laugh</span>] Ha! I knew darned well she couldn’t hold out—that she’d ask to see me again. [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">He misquotes cynically</span>] “Women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want another act.”<span class=\"footnote\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">*</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">The quote is from playwright Oscar Wilde.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(25) MILDRED: Is that so, Smarty?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(26) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">as if he were weighing the matter</span>] I don’t know whether I’ll consent to keep this date or not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(27) MILDRED: Well, I know! You’re not allowed out, you silly! So you can’t!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(28) RICHARD: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">dropping all pretense—defiantly</span>] Can’t I, though! You wait and see if I can’t! I’ll see her tonight if it’s the last thing I ever do! I don’t care how I’m punished after!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(29) MILDRED: [<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">admiringly</span>] Goodness! I never thought you had such nerve!</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Copyright © 1933 by Eugene O’Neill<span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\"></span></span><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Copyright © renewed 1960 by Carlotta Monterey O’Neill</span><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Reprinted by permission of ICM Partners</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">overwhelmed by the knowledge that Muriel returns his feelings</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">convinced that Muriel did not mean what she said</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">upset that Muriel had talked to Mildred about her feelings</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">saddened that Muriel did not want to be in a relationship with him</p>"],"answer":4}]
