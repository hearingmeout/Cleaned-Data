At the airport, my flight grounded by a storm,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I bought a magazine, which fell open to a photograph</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of three roseate spoonbills tossing down their elegant shadows</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on a chartreuse field of fertilizer-production waste.</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two little girls emptied their Ziplocs of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>10 onto the carpet &amp; picked them up, one by one, with great delicacy,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;before popping them into their mouths. Their mother, outside</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;smoking, kept an eye on them through the glass. After my cousin died,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my father died &amp; then my brother. Next, my father’s older brother</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; his wife. And, finally, after my mother died, I expected</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>15 to die myself. And because this happened very quickly</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; because these were, really, almost all the people I knew,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I spent each day smashing dishes with one of my uncle’s hammers</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; gluing them back together in new ways. It was strange work</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; dangerous, even though I tried to protect myself—</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>20 wearing a quilted bathrobe &amp; goggles &amp; leather work gloves</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; opening all the windows, even in snow, against the vapors</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of the industrial adhesives. Most days now I get up late</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; brew coffee &amp; the smell rises from the old enamel pot</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I’ve had to balance under the dark drip ever since the carafe</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>25 that came with the machine shattered in the dishwasher last month.</span></div>\n\n<div class=\"verse\"><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One morning I found a lump in my breast &amp; my vision narrowed</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to a small dot &amp; I began to sweat. My legs &amp; arms felt weak,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; my heart thrashed behind its bars. We were not written</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be safe. In the old tales, the woodcutter’s daughter’s path</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>30 takes her, each time, through the dark forest. There are new words</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for all of this: a shot of panic becomes the rustle of glucocorticoid</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;signaling the sympathetic nervous system into a response</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;regulated by the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, as I go along, these freshly minted charms clatter together</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>35&nbsp;in the tender doeskin of the throat as though the larynx</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were nothing if not a sack of amulets tied with a cord &amp; worn</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around the neck. But I tell you I sat on the bathroom floors for hours,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trembling. And I can tell you this because the lump was just a lump</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp; some days now I don’t even dread the end although I know</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>40 it will arrive. The garage is filled with buckets of broken china.</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls chased each other &amp; waved their arms, casting spells,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the trim of their matching gingham dresses the electric pink</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of the birds’ wings. They turned each other into princesses</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp; super-girls &amp; then they pretended to change back.</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span><span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">45 Oh, no. You forgot to say forever</span>—they took turns repeating</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with dramatic dismay, melting into puddles of themselves,</span><br />\n<span class=\"line\"><span class=\"badge badge-inverse line_number\"></span><span class=\"indent indent_0\"></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;their sandals &amp; sunburned knees vanishing beneath their hems.</span></div>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">From THE ETERNAL CITY: POEMS by Kathleen Graber.
