And that was in 1979.” <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR021470_12 itemref:VR025206\" id=\"VR021470_12\"></span>It was a project. <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR021470_14 itemref:VR025210\" id=\"VR021470_14\"></span>Much equipment was needed. Preparations were made<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR021470_12\"></span>. <span id=\"ref-013-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-013 passage_reference_highlight\">Chanu bought a pair of shorts which hung just below his knees. He tried them on and filled the numerous pockets with a compass, guidebook, binoculars, bottled water, maps, and two types of disposable camera. Thus loaded, the shorts hung at mid-calf. He bought a baseball cap and wore it around the flat with the visor variously angled up and down and turned around to the back of his head.</span> A money belt secured the shorts around his waist and prevented them from reaching his ankles. He made a list of tourist attractions and devised a star rating system that encompassed historical significance, something he termed <span id=\"ref-014-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-014 passage_reference_highlight\">“entertainment factor,”</span> and value for money. <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR021470_13 itemref:VR025206\" id=\"VR021470_13\"></span>The girls would enjoy themselves. They were forewarned of this requirement<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR021470_13\"></span>.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR021470_11\"></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 2</span> <span class=\"highlight_ref-067 passage_reference_highlight\">On a hot Saturday morning towards the end of July the planning came to fruition. <span id=\"ref-015-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-015 passage_reference_highlight\"> “I’ve spent more than half my life here,” said Chanu, “but I hardly left these few streets.” He stared out of the bus window at the grimy colors of Bethnal Green Road. “All this time I have been struggling and struggling, and I barely had time to lift my head and look around.”</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 3</span> They sat at the front of the bus, on the top deck. Chanu shared a seat with Nazneen and Shahana, and Bibi sat across the aisle. Nazneen crossed her ankles and tucked her feet beneath the seat to make way for the two plastic carrier bags that contained their picnic. <span id=\"ref-016-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-016 passage_reference_highlight\"> “You’ll stink the bus out,” Shahana had said. “I’m not sitting with you.”</span></span> But she had not moved away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 4</span>  “It’s like this,” said Chanu. “When you have all the time in the world to see something, you don’t bother to see it. Now that we are going home, I have become a tourist.” He pulled his sunglasses from his forehead onto his nose. They were part of the new equipment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 5</span> Nazneen looked down at his sandals, which were also new. She regarded the thick yellow nails of his big toes. The spongy head of a corn poked from beneath the strap. <span id=\"ref-017-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-017 passage_reference_highlight\">She had neglected them, these feet.</span> <span id=\"ref-018-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-018 passage_reference_highlight\"> She brushed an imaginary hair from her husband’s shoulder.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 6</span>  <span id=\"ref-019-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-019 passage_reference_highlight\">He turned to the girls. “How do you like your holiday so far?” Bibi said that she liked it very well, and Shahana squinted and shuffled and leaned her head against the window.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 7</span> Chanu began to hum. He danced with his head, which wobbled from side to side, and drummed out a rhythm on his thigh. The humming appeared to come from low down in his chest and melded with the general tune of the bus, vibrating on the bass notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 8</span> Nazneen decided she would make this day unlike any other. She would not allow this day to disappoint him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 9</span> The conductor came to collect fares. He had a slack-jawed expression: nothing could interest him. “Two at one pound, and two children please,” said Chanu. He received his tickets. “Sightseeing,” he announced, and flourished his guidebook. “Family holiday.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 10</span>  “Right,” said the conductor. He jingled his bag, looking for change. He was squashed by his job. The ceiling forced him to stoop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 11</span>  <span id=\"ref-020-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-020 passage_reference_highlight\"> “Can you tell me something? To your mind, does the British Museum rate more highly than the National Gallery? Or would you recommend gallery over museum?”</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 12</span>  <span class=\"highlight_ref-020 passage_reference_highlight\">The conductor pushed his lower lip out with his tongue. He stared hard at Chanu, as if considering whether to eject him from the bus.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 13</span>  <span class=\"highlight_ref-020 passage_reference_highlight\"> “In my rating system,” explained Chanu, “they are neck and neck. It would be good to take an opinion from a local.”</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 14</span>  <span id=\"ref-021-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-021 passage_reference_highlight\">“Where’ve you come from, mate?”</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 15</span>  <span class=\"highlight_ref-021 passage_reference_highlight\"> “Oh, just two blocks behind,” said Chanu. “But this is the first holiday for twenty or thirty years.”</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 16</span> The conductor swayed. It was still early but the bus was hot and Nazneen could smell his sweat. He looked at Chanu’s guidebook. He twisted around and looked at the girls. At a half-glance he knew everything about Nazneen, and then he shook his head and walked away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Reprinted with the permission of Scribner, a Division of Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., from BRICK LANE by Monica Ali.
