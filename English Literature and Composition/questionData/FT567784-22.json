In this passage, two characters who have been living on the Blithedale farm—a community designed to promote an ideal of equality achieved through communal rural living—are about to part ways. Read the passage carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how Hawthorne uses literary elements and techniques to portray the narrator’s complex attitude towards Zenobia.</p>\n\n<p>In your response you should do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation.</li>\n\t<li>Select and use evidence to support your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Her manner bewildered me. Literally, moreover,<br />\nI was dazzled by the brilliancy of the room. A<br />\nchandelier hung down in the centre, glowing with I<br />\n<strong>(5)</strong> know not how many lights; there were separate lamps,<br />\n5 also, on two or three tables, and on marble brackets,<br />\nadding their white radiance to that of the chandelier.<br />\nThe furniture was exceedingly rich. Fresh from our<br />\nold farm-house, with its homely board and benches in<br />\nthe dining-room, and a few wicker chairs in the best<br />\n<strong>(10)</strong> parlor, it struck me that here was the fulfillment of<br />\nevery fantasy of an imagination, revelling in various<br />\nmethods of costly self-indulgence and splendid ease.<br />\nPictures, marbles, vases; in brief, more shapes of<br />\nluxury than there could be any object in enumerating,<br />\n<strong>(15)</strong> except for an auctioneer’s advertisement—and the<br />\nwhole repeated and doubled by the reflection of a<br />\ngreat mirror, which showed me Zenobia’s proud<br />\nfigure, likewise, and my own. It cost me, I<br />\nacknowledge, a bitter sense of shame, to perceive in<br />\n<strong>(20)</strong> myself a positive effort to bear up against the effect<br />\nwhich Zenobia sought to impose on me. I reasoned<br />\nagainst her, in my secret mind, and strove so to keep<br />\nmy footing. In the gorgeousness with which she had<br />\nsurrounded herself— in the redundance of personal<br />\n<strong>(25)</strong> ornament, which the largeness of her physical nature<br />\nand the rich type of her beauty caused to seem so<br />\nsuitable — I malevolently beheld the true character of<br />\nthe woman, passionate, luxurious, lacking simplicity,<br />\nnot deeply refined, incapable of pure and perfect taste.<br />\n<strong>(30)</strong> But, the next instant, she was too powerful for all<br />\nmy opposing struggles. I saw how fit it was that she<br />\nshould make herself as gorgeous as she pleased, and<br />\nshould do a thousand things that would have been<br />\nridiculous in the poor, thin, weakly characters of other<br />\n<strong>(35)</strong> women. To this day, however, I hardly know whether<br />\nI then beheld Zenobia in her truest attitude, or<br />\nwhether that were the truer one in which she had<br />\npresented herself at Blithedale. In both, there was<br />\nsomething like the illusion which a great actress flings<br />\n<strong>(40)</strong> around her.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Have you given up Blithedale forever?” I<br />\ninquired.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why should you think so?” asked she.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I cannot tell,” answered I; “except that it appears<br />\n<strong>(45)</strong> all like a dream that we were ever there together.”<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It is not so to me,” said Zenobia. “I should think it<br />\na poor and meagre nature, that is capable of but one<br />\nset of forms, and must convert all the past into a<br />\ndream, merely because the present happens to be<br />\n<strong>(50)</strong> unlike it. Why should we be content with our homely<br />\nlife of a few months past, to the exclusion of all other<br />\nmodes? It was good; but there are other lives as good<br />\nor better. Not, you will understand, that I condemn<br />\nthose who give themselves up to it more entirely than<br />\n<strong>(55)</strong> I, for myself, should deem it wise to do.”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It irritated me, this self-complacent,<br />\ncondescending, qualified approval and criticism of a<br />\nsystem to which many individuals —perhaps as<br />\nhighly endowed as our gorgeous Zenobia — had<br />\n<strong>(60)</strong> contributed their all of earthly endeavor, and their<br />\nloftiest aspirations. I determined to make proof if<br />\nthere were any spell that would exorcise her out of the<br />\npart which she seemed to be acting. She should be<br />\ncompelled to give me a glimpse of something true;<br />\n<strong>(65)</strong> some nature, some passion, no matter whether right or<br />\nwrong, provided it were real.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Your allusion to that class of circumscribed<br />\ncharacters, who can live in only one mode of life,”<br />\nremarked I, coolly, “reminds me of our poor friend<br />\n<strong>(70)</strong> Hollingsworth.* Possibly, he was in your thoughts,<br />\nwhen you spoke thus. Poor fellow! It is a pity that, by<br />\nthe fault of a narrow education, he should have so<br />\ncompletely immolated himself to that one idea of his;<br />\nespecially as the slightest modicum of common-sense<br />\n(75) would teach him its utter impracticability. Now that I<br />\nhave returned into the world, and can look at his<br />\nproject from a distance, it requires quite all my real<br />\nregard for this respectable and well-intentioned man<br />\nto prevent me laughing at him — as, I find, society at<br />\n<strong>(80)</strong> large does!”</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Zenobia’s eyes darted lightning; her cheeks<br />\nflushed; the vividness of her expression was like the<br />\neffect of a powerful light, flaming up suddenly within<br />\nher. My experiment had fully succeeded. She had<br />\n<strong>(85)</strong> shown me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by<br />\nthus involuntarily resenting my slight, pitying, half-<br />\nkind, half-scornful mention of the man who was all in<br />\nall with her. She herself, probably, felt this; for it was<br />\nhardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven<br />\n<strong>(90)</strong> breath, and seemed as proud and self-possessed as<br />\never.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\">* a charismatic member of the Blithedale community who assumes a<br />\nleadership position</span></p>\n"}]}]
