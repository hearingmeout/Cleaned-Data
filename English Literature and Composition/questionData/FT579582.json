The violence of the contrast was real and made the strongest motive of education. <span id=\"ref-039-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-039 passage_reference_highlight\">The double exterior nature gave life its relative values</span>. Winter and summer, cold and heat, town and country, force and freedom, marked two modes of life and thought, balanced like lobes of the brain. Town was winter confinement, school, rule, discipline; straight, gloomy streets, piled with six feet of snow in the middle; frosts that made the snow sing under wheels or runners; thaws when the streets became dangerous to cross; society of uncles, aunts, and cousins who expected children to behave themselves, and who were not always gratified; above all else, <span id=\"ref-040-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-040 passage_reference_highlight\">winter represented the desire to escape</span> and go free. Town was restraint, law, unity. Country, only seven miles away, was liberty, diversity, outlawry, the endless delight of mere sense impressions given by nature for nothing, and breathed by boys without knowing it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 2</span> <span id=\"ref-041-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-041 passage_reference_highlight\">Boys are wild animals</span>, rich in the treasures of sense, but the New England boy had a wider range of emotions than boys of more equable climates. He felt his nature crudely, as it was meant. <span id=\"ref-030-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-030 passage_reference_highlight\">To the boy Henry Adams</span>, summer was drunken. <span id=\"ref-031-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-031 passage_reference_highlight\">Among senses, smell was the strongest — smell of hot pine-woods and sweet-fern in the scorching summer noon; of new-mown hay; of ploughed earth; of box hedges; of peaches, lilacs, syringas<sup>1</sup>; of stables, barns, cow- yards; of salt water and low tide on the marshes; nothing came amiss. Next to smell came taste, and the children knew the taste of everything they saw or touched, from pennyroyal and flagroot<sup>2</sup> to the shell of a pignut and the letters of a spelling-book — the taste of A-B, AB, suddenly revived on the boy’s tongue sixty years afterwards.</span> Light, line, and color as sensual pleasures, came later and were as <span id=\"ref-033-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-033 passage_reference_highlight\">crude</span> as the rest. The New England light is glare, and <span id=\"ref-042-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-042 passage_reference_highlight\">the atmosphere harshens color</span>. The boy was a full man before he ever knew what was meant by <span id=\"ref-034-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-034 passage_reference_highlight\">atmosphere</span>; his idea of pleasure in light was the blaze of a New England sun. His idea of color was a peony, with the dew of early morning on its petals. The intense blue of the sea, as he saw it a mile or two away, from the Quincy hills; the cumuli<sup>3</sup> in a June afternoon sky; the strong reds and greens and purples of colored prints and children’s picture-books, as the American colors then ran; <span id=\"ref-036-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-036 passage_reference_highlight\">these were ideals</span>. The opposites or antipathies, were the cold grays of November evenings, and the thick, muddy thaws of Boston winter. With such standards, the Bostonian could not but develop a double nature. Life was a double thing. After a January blizzard, the boy who could look with pleasure into the violent snow-glare of the cold white sunshine, with its intense light and shade, scarcely knew what was meant by <span id=\"ref-035-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-035 passage_reference_highlight\">tone</span>. He could <span id=\"ref-037-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-037 passage_reference_highlight\">reach</span> it only by education.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 3</span> Winter and summer, then, were two hostile lives, and bred two separate natures.
