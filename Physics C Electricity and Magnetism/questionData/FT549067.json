Treat this distribution as two point charges, a negative charge of –30 C at a height of 2 km above ground and a positive charge of +30 C at a height of 3 km. The presence of these charges induces charges on the ground. Assuming the ground is a conductor, it can be shown that the induced charges can be treated as a charge of +30 C at a depth of 2 km below ground and a charge of –30 C at a depth of 3 km, as shown above right.
