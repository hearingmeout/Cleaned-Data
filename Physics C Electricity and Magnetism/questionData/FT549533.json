The rails are inclined at an angle 𝜽 with respect to the horizontal, as shown above, and the bar is able to slide on the rails with negligible friction. The bar and rails are in a uniform and constant magnetic field of magnitude <em>B</em> oriented perpendicular to the incline. A resistor of resistance <em>R</em> connects the upper ends of the rails and completes the circuit as shown. The bar is released from rest at the top of the incline.Express your answers to parts a. through d. in terms of <em>m,</em> ℓ , 𝜽 , <em>B</em>, <em>R, and g.</em></p>\n\n<p>a.
