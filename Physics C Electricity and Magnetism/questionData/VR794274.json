What evidence or reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR794274_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, the current changes. The switch prevents charge from flowing in the circuit when it is open, but not when it is closed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, the current changes. Closing the switch creates an additional closed electrical loop and the lightbulb is part of this loop.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, the current does not change. The lightbulb and the switch are not in series with one another.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, the current does not change.
