A nearby vertical wall, also made of an insulating material, is electrically neutral. When the balloon is brought into contact with the wall and then released, the balloon sticks to the wall. Which of the following explains why the balloon sticks to the wall?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR797894_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The wall loses electrons that are repelled by the balloon, leaving behind a net positive charge on the wall that attracts the balloon.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Electrons in the wall are conducted away from the balloon, creating a positively charged region in the vicinity of the balloon that the balloon is attracted to.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The wall gains electrons that, through their mutual repulsion, are transferred off of the balloon, and the added electrons on the wall then attract the remaining positive charge on the balloon.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Electrons in the wall move a small distance away from the balloon, and then exert a repulsive force on the balloon that is smaller than the attractive force from the residual positive charge in the part of the wall that is slightly closer to the balloon.</p>"],"answer":3}]
