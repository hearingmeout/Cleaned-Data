Each circuit also contains a variable power supply, which is not shown. In Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math></span></span>, the power supply maintains a constant potential difference across the resistor as the resistance is changed. In Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math></span></span>, the power supply is adjusted to keep the current in the resistor constant as the resistance is changed. If the resistance is increased for both resistors, in which circuit(s), if either, will the power dissipated by the resistor increase as well?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR794272_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></math></span></span> only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></math></span></span> only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both circuits</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neither circuit</p>"],"answer":1}]
