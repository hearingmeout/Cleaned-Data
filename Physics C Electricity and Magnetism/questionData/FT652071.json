Support your answers with relevant physics principles.&nbsp; The parts within the question may not have equal weight.&nbsp; Write your answers in the parts provided after each part.&nbsp; If you find you are in need of symbolic notation that is too difficult to type, you may identify a non-standard symbol and use that throughout your answer.&nbsp; For example, you may identify “Q” as the measurement for an angle.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:13px\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a large gray circle with its radius indicated as capital R representing the nonconducting sphere.

The vertical axis ranges from zero to one hundred volts in ten volt divisions.  The horizontal axis ranges from zero to ten meters in one meter divisions.  The graph starts at zero meters comma one hundred volts with zero slope and is concave down.  The slope becomes more negative to the point two meters comma sixty volts, and then the graph becomes concave-up.  The negative slope of the graph becomes less steep and the graph reaches a minimum at five meters comma zero.  The slope then becomes increasingly positive until the point eight meters comma forty five volts, and then the graph changes to concave-down again.  The positive slope becomes less steep and the graph ends on a maximum at ten meters comma sixty volts, where the slope is again zero.\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/3b4c2565-3d57-4ee2-85b3-b665f6418b53.png\" width=\"444\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:13px\"><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">A large, nonconducting sphere of radius <span aria-label=\"capital r is equal to 10 meters\">\\(R=10\\ \\)</span>m is fixed in space and carries a spherically symmetrical charge distribution.&nbsp; The sign and density of the charge distribution changes as a function of radius \\(r\\)&nbsp;from the center of the sphere represented by \\(\\rho\\left(r\\right)\\).&nbsp; A hole extends from one side of the sphere, through the sphere’s center, and to the opposite&nbsp;side of the sphere.&nbsp; A small nonconducting ball carries a positive net charge and is placed within the hole.&nbsp; The location of the ball is&nbsp; \\(x\\).&nbsp; The friction between the nonconducting ball and the sphere is negligible, and the ball does not exchange charge with the larger sphere.&nbsp; Gravitational effects are negligible.&nbsp; The graph shows the electric potential <span aria-label=\"uppercase V as a function of lowercase r\">\\(V\\left(r\\right)\\)</span>&nbsp;at points in the hole between the center of the sphere at <span aria-label=\"lowercase r equals zero meters\">\\(r=0\\ \\)</span>m and at the right end of the sphere at <span aria-label=\"lowercase r equals ten meters\">\\(r=10\\ \\)</span>m.</span></span></span></p>\n"},{"id":"FT652071","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"(a)&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">What is the farthest position from the center of the sphere from which the ball may be released from rest and exit the sphere?&nbsp; Justify your answer.</span></span></span>"},{"id":"FT652071","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"(b)&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">The ball is released from the position indicated in part (a) and exits the sphere.&nbsp; Describe the magnitude and direction of the ball’s acceleration between <span aria-label=\"lowercase r equals five meters\">\\(r=5\\ \\)</span>m and <span aria-label=\"lowercase r equals ten meters\">\\(r=10\\ \\)</span>m.&nbsp; Explain your reasoning.</span></span></span>"},{"id":"FT652071","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"(c)&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">A student wishing to model the electric field within the hole for \\(0 &lt; r &lt; 10\\ \\)m suggests the equation \\(E\\left(r\\right)=A\\left(B-r\\right)\\)&nbsp;where \\(A=4\\ V/m^2\\)&nbsp;and <span aria-label=\"cap b is equal to 5 meters\">\\(B=5\\ m\\)</span>.&nbsp; Consider positive values of <span aria-label=\"cap e times r\">\\(E\\left(r\\right)\\)</span>&nbsp;to be directed rightward.&nbsp;</span></span></span>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:13px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">State one feature of this equation that correctly models the electric field within the hole.&nbsp; Justify your answer.</span></span></span></p>\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"></span></span></span>"},{"id":"FT652071","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"(d)&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif\">State one feature of this equation that does <u>NOT</u> correctly model the electric field within the hole.&nbsp; Justify your answer.</span></span></span>"},{"id":"FT652071","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"(e)&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:115%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Explain the steps that the student must follow in order to derive \\(\\rho\\left(r\\right)\\)&nbsp;from \\(E\\left(r\\right)\\).</span></span></span>"}]
