Each of them generally curve upwards and to the right. At the bottom left of the region, the field lines are roughly linear and clustered close together. The field lines spread out widely as they move upward and to the right. The middle field line, labeled 0 volts, is roughly linear. The field line just below it, labeled 1 volt, starts roughly linear and the curves downward and to the right. The field line just below that field line, labeled 2 volts, starts roughly linear then curves downward and to the left at a faster rate. The field line just above the middle field line, labeled negative 1 volt, starts roughly linear then curves upward and to the right slightly. The field line just above that field line, labeled negative 2 volts, starts roughly linear then curves upward and to the right. The field line just above that field line, labeled negative 3 volts, starts roughly linear then curves upward and to the right sharply, becoming vertical before it continues to curve backward. Five points, lettered A through E, are indicated along the field lines. Point A is on the negative 2 volt field line, to the bottom left where it is roughly linear. Point B is on the negative 2 volt field line, towards the center where the field line transitions from being roughly linear to being curved. Point C is on the negative 1 volt field line, to the top right where the field line is curving slightly. Point D is on the 0 volt field line, to the top right. Point E is on the 1 volt field line, towards the bottom center where the field line transitions from being roughly linear to being curved.\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184660.g03.png\" width=\"265\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The diagram above shows equipotential lines in a particular region.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows an arrow that points downward and to the left.\" height=\"45\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184661.g05.png\" width=\"45\" /></span></p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"></span></p>\n\n\n<span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows an arrow that points upward and to the right.\" height=\"45\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184661.g07.png\" width=\"45\"></span>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"></span></p>\n\n\n<span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows an arrow that points upward and to the left.\" height=\"45\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184661.g09.png\" width=\"45\"></span>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"></span></p>\n\n\n<span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows an arrow that points downward and to the right.\" height=\"45\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR184661.g11.png\" width=\"45\"></span>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">None of the above; the magnitude of the field is zero.</p>"],"answer":2}]
