Aluminum foil is attached to each end of the clay as shown in the figure. Students are told that their experimental design must focus on varying the radius of the clay cylinder. The students are expected to find the dielectric constant by plotting their data in a graph. In addition to equipment commonly found in a high school physics laboratory, students have access to a multimeter that is able to measure capacitance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Identify each quantity to be measured, the symbol that will be used to represent that quantity, and the equipment that would be used to measure that quantity.</p>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252474_rubric"},{"id":"VR252474","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Describe the procedure to be used to determine the dielectric constant of the clay.
