The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled uppercase R. The current is labeled I and is directed up the right side of the circuit. The second circuit has a battery and 2 resistors. The top side of the circuit has an unlabeled battery and a resistor labeled lowercase r. There is a box made of dashed lines drawn around the battery and resistor lowercase r. The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled 3 times uppercase R.
