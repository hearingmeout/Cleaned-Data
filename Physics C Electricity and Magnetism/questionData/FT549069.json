The rod is suspended by vertical connecting wires of length <em>d</em>, and the horizontal wires that connect to the battery are fixed. All these wires have negligible mass and resistance. The rod is a distance <em>r</em> above a conducting cable. The cable is very long and is located directly below and parallel to the rod. Earth’s gravitational pull is toward the bottom of the page. Express all algebraic answers in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n(a) What is the magnitude and direction of the current <em>I</em> in the rod?</p>\n\n<p>(b) In which direction must there be a current in the cable to exert an upward force on the rod?
