Each sphere has a charge of positive Q. Sphere 3 is aligned along the y axis, above the origin, and has a charge of negative Q. Five positions are labeled on the coordinate plane: A, B, C, D, and E.  Position A lies directly above Sphere 3 along the y axis. Position B lies directly above Sphere 2 and directly to the right of Sphere 3, outside of the triangle. Positions A and B are equidistant from Sphere 3. Position C lies in the center of the equilateral triangle, directly below Sphere 3 along the y axis equidistant from all three spheres.
