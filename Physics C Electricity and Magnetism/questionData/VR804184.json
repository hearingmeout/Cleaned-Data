The switches have both been closed for a long time so that both circuits have reached a steady state. The switches are then both opened and the batteries replaced with wires. The switches are then closed again. In which circuit will the capacitor more quickly discharge to half of its initial charge, and what evidence or reasoning supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR804184_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span>.
