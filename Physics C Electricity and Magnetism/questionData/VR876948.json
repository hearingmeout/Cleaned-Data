The circuit has three vertical branches and two horizontal branches. The left vertical branch has a voltmeter. From bottom to top, the inner vertical branch has a battery with e m f script uppercase E and a resistor with resistance lowercase r. The battery and the resistor with resistance lowercase r are enclosed in a dashed rectangle. The right vertical branch has a resistor with resistance uppercase R. The bottom horizontal branch has a capacitor with capacitance C between the inner vertical branch and the right vertical branch. The top horizontal branch has an open switch labeled S between the inner vertical branch and the right vertical branch.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR876948.g02.svg\" /></div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It is higher.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It is lower.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It is the same and is zero.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It is the same and is not zero.</p>"],"answer":1}]
