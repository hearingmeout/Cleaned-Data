The resistor is carefully stretched so that its volume does not change, it remains a cylinder, and its length doubles. Which of the following graphs best shows the resistance of the wire as a function of the length of the wire as the wire is stretched?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR184670_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the graph of a line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane.
