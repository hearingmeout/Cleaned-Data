In the face of such commodification, African Americans used these skills to survive, create culture, and build community.","411965":"2.6.B: Explain how slave labor systems affected the formation of African American musical and linguistic practices.","411966":"2.6.B.1: Enslaved agricultural laborers often worked in a gang system or a task system.","411967":"2.6.B.2: In the gang system, enslaved laborers worked in groups from sunup to sundown, under the watch and discipline of an overseer, as they cultivated crops like cotton, sugar, and tobacco. Enslaved people working in gangs created work songs (in English) with syncopated rhythms to keep the pace of work.","411968":"2.6.B.3: In the task system, enslaved people worked individually until they met a daily quota, generally with less supervision. The task system was used for the cultivation of crops like rice and indigo. With less oversight, some enslaved people maintained linguistic practices, such as the Gullah creole language that developed in the Carolina lowcountry.","411969":"2.6.C: Evaluate the economic effects of enslaved people's commodification and labor, within and outside of African American communities.","411970":"2.6.C.1: Slavery fostered economic interdependence between the North and South. Cities that did not play a major role in the African slave trade nonetheless benefited from the economy created by slavery.","411971":"2.6.C.2: Enslaved people and their labor were foundational to the American economy, even though they and their descendants were alienated from the wealth that they both embodied and produced.","411972":"2.6.C.3: Over centuries slavery deeply entrenched wealth disparities along America's racial lines. Enslaved African Americans had no wages to pass down to descendants and no legal right to accumulate property, and individual exceptions to these laws depended on their enslavers' decisions.","411973":"2.7: Slavery and American Law: Slave Codes and Landmark Cases","411974":"2.7.A: Explain how American law affected the lives and citizenship rights of enslaved and free African Americans between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.","411975":"2.7.A.1: Article I and Article IV of the United States Constitution refer to slavery but avoid using the terms \"slave\" or \"slavery.\" \"Slave\" appeared in an early draft but was removed. These terms appear for the first time in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery.","411976":"2.7.A.2: Slave codes defined chattel slavery as a race-based, inheritable, lifelong condition and included restrictions on movement, congregation, possessing weapons, and wearing fine fabrics, among other activities. These regulations manifested in enslaving societies throughout the Americas, including the Code Noir and \\(\\textit{Código Negro}\\) in French and Spanish colonies, respectively.","411977":"2.7.A.3: Slave codes and other laws hardened the color line in American society by reserving opportunities for upward mobility and protection from enslavement for white people based on their race and by denying opportunities to Black people on the same premise.","411978":"2.7.A.4: Free states enacted laws to deny free African Americans opportunities for advancement.<ol type=\"i\" start=\"1\"><li>Some free states barred entry of free Black people into the state.</li></ol><ol type=\"i\" start=\"2\"><li>Some states enacted restrictions to keep free Black men from voting (e.g., New York) and testifying against white people in court (e.g., Ohio).</li></ol><ol type=\"i\" start=\"3\"><li>Before the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, only Wisconsin and Iowa had given Black men the right to vote.</li></ol>","411979":"2.7.B: Explain how slave codes developed in response to African Americans' resistance to slavery.","411980":"2.7.B.1: South Carolina's 1740 slave code was updated in response to enslaved people's resistance during the Stono Rebellion in 1739. The 1740 code classified all Black people and the Indigenous communities that did not submit to the colonial government as nonsubjects and presumed enslaved people.","411981":"2.7.B.2: South Carolina's 1740 slave code prohibited enslaved people from gathering, drumming, learning to read, rebelling, running away, or moving abroad, including to other colonial territories. It condemned to death any enslaved persons who tried to defend themselves from attack by a white person.","411982":"2.7.B.3: Legal codes and landmark cases intertwined to define the status of African Americans by denying them citizenship rights and protections. Dred Scott's freedom suit (1857) resulted in the Supreme Court's decision that African Americans, enslaved and free, were not and could never become citizens of the United States.","411983":"2.8: The Social Construction of Race and the Reproduction of Status","411984":"2.8.A: Explain how \\(\\textit{partus sequitur ventrem}\\) affected African American families and informed the emergence of racial taxonomies in the United States.","411985":"2.8.A.1: \\(\\textit{Partus sequitur ventrem}\\), a seventeenth-century law, defined a child's legal status based on the status of their mother and held significant consequences for enslaved African Americans.","411986":"2.8.A.2: \\(\\textit{Partus}\\) codified hereditary racial slavery in the United States by ensuring that enslaved African American women's children would inherit their status as property, which invalidated African Americans' claims to their children.","411987":"2.8.A.3: \\(\\textit{Partus}\\) was designed to prohibit the mixed-race children of Black women from inheriting the free status of their fathers (the custom in English common law).","411988":"2.8.A.4: \\(\\textit{Partus}\\) gave male enslavers the right to deny responsibility for the children they fathered with enslaved women (most often through assault) and to commodify enslaved women's reproductive lives.","411989":"2.8.B: Explain how racial concepts and classifications emerged alongside definitions of status.","411990":"2.8.B.1: Within the discipline of African American Studies, among other fields, the concept of race is considered socially constructed, not based on clear biological distinctions. More genetic difference and variation appear within racial groups than between racial groups. Current biological knowledge does not impute cultural, political, or economic achievement to \"races.\" Concepts and classifications of racial types emerged in tandem with systems of enslavement and oppression.","411991":"2.8.B.2: Phenotype (e.g., skin color, hair texture) contributes largely to perceptions of racial identity. During the era of slavery, racial categories were also defined by law, regardless of phenotype. Legal statutes like \\(\\textit{partus sequitur ventrem}\\) defined racial categories and tied them to rights and status (e.g., enslaved, free, citizen) in order to perpetuate slavery over generations.","411992":"2.8.B.3: In the United States, race classification was determined based on hypodescent. Before the Civil War, states differed on the percentage of ancestry that defined a person as white or Black. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a practice known as the \"one-drop rule\" classified a person with any degree of African descent as part of a singular, inferior status.","411993":"2.8.B.4: Although many African Americans had European or Indigenous ancestry, race classification prohibited them from fully embracing multiracial or multiethnic heritage.","411994":"2.9: Creating African American Culture","411995":"2.9.A: Describe African American forms of self-expression in art, music, and language that combine influences from diverse African cultures with local sources.","411996":"2.9.A.1: African American creative expression drew upon blended influences from African ancestors, community members, and local European and Indigenous cultures.","411997":"2.9.A.2: African Americans incorporated African aesthetic influences as they made pottery and established a tradition of quilt-making as a medium of storytelling and memory keeping.","411998":"2.9.A.3: African Americans drew from varied African and local influences in the construction of instruments such as rattles from gourds, the banjo, and drums in order to recreate instruments similar to those in West Africa.","411999":"2.9.A.4: Enslaved Africans arrived in the United States with knowledge of both African and European languages. Africans who had participated in long-distance trade were accustomed to developing a lingua franca (or common language) to communicate across languages. Enslaved African Americans continued this practice in the United States and developed creole languages, such as Gullah, which combines elements from West African and European languages.","412000":"2.9.B: Describe ways enslaved African Americans adapted African musical elements from their ancestors and influenced the development of American musical genres.","412001":"2.9.B.1: Enslaved people adapted Christian hymns they learned and combined rhythmic and performative elements from Africa (e.g., call and response, clapping, improvisation, and syncopation) with biblical themes, creating a distinct American musical genre. This became the foundation of later American musical genres, including gospel and the blues.","412002":"2.9.B.2: Senegambians and West Central Africans arrived in large numbers in Louisiana, which influenced the development of American blues.

Enslaved people used spirituals to resist the dehumanizing conditions and injustice of enslavement, express their creativity, and communicate strategic information, such as warnings, plans to run away, and methods of escape.","412006":"2.9.C.3: The lyrics of spirituals often had double meanings. These songs used biblical themes of redemption and deliverance to alert enslaved people to opportunities to run away via the Underground Railroad.","412007":"2.9.C.4: Spirituals reflect African Americans' African heritage and American identity. They preserve rhythms and performance styles from West Africa and express contemporary experiences in America.","412008":"2.10: Black Pride, Identity, and the Question of Naming","412009":"2.10.A: Explain how changing demographics and popular debates about African Americans' identity influenced the terms they used to identify themselves in the nineteenth century and beyond.","412010":"2.10.A.1: After the United States banned international slave trading in 1808, the percentage of African-born people in the African American population declined (despite the importation of enslaved Africans continuing illegally).","412011":"2.10.A.2: The American Colonization Society was founded during the same era by white leaders seeking to exile the growing free Black population to Africa. In response, many Black people emphasized their American identity by rejecting the term \"African,\" the most common term for people of African descent in the United States until the late 1820s.","412012":"2.10.A.3: From the nineteenth century onward, African Americans described themselves through a range of ethnonyms (names of ethnic groups, racial groups, and nationalities), such as Afro-American, African American, and Black.","412013":"2.11: The Stono Rebellion and Fort Mose","412014":"2.11.A: Explain key effects of the asylum offered by Spanish Florida in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","412015":"2.11.A.1: Founded in Florida in 1565, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of African American and European origin in the United States. Beginning in the seventeenth century, enslaved refugees escaping Georgia and the Carolinas fled to St. Augustine, seeking asylum in Spanish Florida, which offered freedom to enslaved people who converted to Catholicism.","412016":"2.11.A.2: In 1738 the governor of Spanish Florida established a fortified settlement under the leadership of Francisco Menéndez, an enslaved Senegambian who fought against the English in the Yamasee War and found refuge in St. Augustine. The settlement, called Fort Mose, was the first sanctioned free Black town in what is now the United States.","412017":"2.11.A.3: Spanish Florida offered emancipation to enslaved people fleeing the British colonies, which in part inspired the Stono Rebellion in South Carolina in 1739. Jemmy, an enslaved man from the Angola region, led nearly 100 enslaved African Americans, who set fire to plantations and marched toward sanctuary in Spanish Florida. Many of the enslaved people participating in the Stono Rebellion were from the Kingdom of Kongo (present-day Angola), and they were Portuguese speakers familiar with Catholicism.","412018":"2.11.A.4: In response to the Stono Rebellion, the British province of South Carolina passed a restrictive slave code in 1740. One month later, British colonial forces invaded Florida, eventually seizing and destroying Fort Mose.","412019":"2.12: Legacies of the Haitian Revolution","412020":"2.12.A: Explain the global impacts of the Haitian Revolution.","412021":"2.12.A.1: The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) was the only uprising of enslaved people that resulted in overturning a colonial, enslaving government.

He further urged African Americans to \"defend themselves\" if the government was \"unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property\" of African Americans. His emphasis on self-defense, sense of dignity, and solidarity influenced the political groups that emerged during the Black Power movement.","412370":"4.9.B.4: Malcolm X's ideas evolved over his lifetime.
