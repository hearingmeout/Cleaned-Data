A movement for black freedom...would inevitably be a movement against economic exploitation and the oppressive conditions faced by other groups within American society as well.... African Americans and...other peoples of color were excluded from basic access to the political process, marginalized socially, and super-exploited economically for the better part of the twentieth century. If this contradiction could not be confronted, Baker felt, there was no hope for American society as a whole. More precisely, she felt that to push and challenge political and economic leaders on this question would expose some of the society’s fundamental flaws and serve as an impetus for transformative social change.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Barbara Ransby, <i>Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision</i>, 2003</p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">The need for a moderate approach to advance the movement’s cause</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The importance of Black women’s leadership in the efforts to secure equality</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The belief that African Americans should emigrate from the United States to Africa</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The decision to pursue Black autonomy instead of prioritizing integration</p>"],"answer":"1710431491799.1577"}]
