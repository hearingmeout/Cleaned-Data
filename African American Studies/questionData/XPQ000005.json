The army and the local police now refused to return fugitives, and mass exodus from plantations was becoming common in the most advanced plantation counties of [the capital city of] São Paulo.... When even members of the imperial family [ruling Brazil] were converted to a radical abolitionist position, there was little hope left for the slave owners. In May 1888, the government finally decreed immediate and totally uncompensated emancipation for all slaves. Thus ended the largest remaining slave regime in America, and with its destruction, African slavery was finally brought to an end in all the Americas.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Herbert S.
