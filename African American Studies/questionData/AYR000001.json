Having destroyed the citizenship of the man, they are now trying to destroy the manhood of the citizen. All their laws are shaped to this end, school laws, railroad car regulations, those governing labor liens on crops, every device is adopted to make slaves of free men and rob them of their wages. Whenever a malicious law is violated in any parts, any farmer, any railroad conductor, or merchant can call together a posse of his neighbors and punish even with death the black man who resists, and the legal authorities sanction what is done by failing to prosecute and punish murders. The Repeal of the Civil Rights Law removed their last barrier and the black man’s last bulwark and refuge. The rule of mob is absolute.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Ida B. Wells, “Lynch Law and All its Phases,” 1893</p></div>"}]}]
