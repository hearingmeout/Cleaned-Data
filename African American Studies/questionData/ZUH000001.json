A recent authority (Grimes (ed.) 1996) puts the number of African languages at 2,035: this number is not fixed, as some languages are still being ‘discovered’, while others with few speakers are being eliminated. Excluding languages introduced over the past two millennia or so, such as Arabic, Malagasy, Afrikaans, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, this figure of just over 2,000 breaks down into four large phyla: Niger-Congo 1,436 languages (including the Bantu family, which itself is often said to have 500 members), Afroasiatic 371, Nilo-Saharan 196 and Khoisan 35. A few Afroasiatic languages are spoken exclusively outside Africa, in the Middle East, which would reduce the figure for Africa somewhat. If we believe this figure of 2,000, then it represents nearly one-third of the world's languages.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse, <i>African Languages, An Introduction</i>, 2000</p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Population declines in West and Central Africa</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Military pressure from Xhosa populations</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Trade opportunities in the desert of North Africa</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Technological and agricultural innovations</p>"],"answer":"1700679194432.1416"}]
