But fate decided that the blow should fall when I was away.... </p><p class=\"dap_body\">My friends declared that the trains and my home were being watched by white men who promised to kill me on sight. They also told me that colored men were organized to protect me if I should return. They said it would mean more bloodshed, more widows and orphans if I came back, and now that I was out of it all, to stay away where I would be safe from harm. </p><p class=\"dap_body\">Because I saw the chance to be of more service to the cause by staying in New York than by returning to Memphis, I accepted their advice, took a position on the New York Age, and continued my fight against lynching and lynchers. They had destroyed my paper, in which every dollar I had in the world was invested. They had made me an exile and threatened my life for hinting at the truth. I felt that I owed it to myself and my race to tell the whole truth.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Ida <span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-sub-alias=\"B\" ssml-label=\"Substitution\">B.</span> Wells, co-owner of The <i>Free Speech and Headlight</i>, describing events in <span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-say-as=\"date\" ssml-label=\"Date\">1892</span>, from her autobiography <i>Crusade for Justice</i></p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Jim Crow laws enforced racial segregation in the United States, which caused white people in the South to feel more justified in racial attacks.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The election of <span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-say-as=\"date\" ssml-label=\"Date\">1876</span> ended Reconstruction but increased legal protections for recently freed African Americans, contributing to anger among white Southerners.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The Supreme Court’s ruling in <i>Plessy </i><span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-sub-alias=\"v\" ssml-label=\"Substitution\">v.</span><i> Ferguson</i> introduced the doctrine of “separate but equal” allowing Black businesses to challenge their white counterparts.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Union Army field orders provided so many southern Black people with land and education that white Southerners felt disinherited.</p>"],"answer":"1717184345378.1404"}]
