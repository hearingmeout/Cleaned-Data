It would not be excessive to say the 800 people of multiple genders and ages who enacted the Combahee Uprising, after a full year of intelligence and organizing by Tubman and eight of her trusted scouts, achieved freedom for themselves and played a key role in ending chattel slavery as a legal institutional practice in the United States.\"</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Alexis Pauline Gumbs, African American Studies scholar, “Prophecy in the Present Tense: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee Pilgrimage, and Dreams Coming True,” article published in 2014</p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Harriet Tubman’s actions in the Combahee River uprising served as an inspiration for Nat Turner and Denmark Vesey’s rebellions.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Harriet Tubman participated in the Combahee River uprising primarily by providing advice to Union Army commanders.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Harriet Tubman’s leadership in the Combahee River raid significantly influenced the overall outcome of the Civil War.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Harriet Tubman’s role as a conductor of the Underground Railroad was more important than her role in the Combahee River uprising.</p>"],"answer":"1709849579930.0913"}]
