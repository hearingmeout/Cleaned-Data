Most important, the Combahee River uprising—during which almost 800 enslaved people of African descent stole themselves to freedom, burned down thirty-two plantation buildings, and flooded the rice plantations that were the center of South Carolina’s confederate economy—could be called the most successful uprising against slavery in the U.S. The Combahee River uprising had the triple impact of achieving freedom for hundreds of enslaved Africans, causing irreparable damage to South Carolina rice plantations, and adding hundreds of black troops to the Union army’s campaign in the South Carolina stronghold of the Confederacy at a major turning point of the Civil War. It would not be excessive to say the 800 people of multiple genders and ages who enacted the Combahee Uprising, after a full year of intelligence and organizing by Tubman and eight of her trusted scouts, achieved freedom for themselves and played a key role in ending chattel slavery as a legal institutional practice in the United States.\"</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Alexis Pauline Gumbs, African American Studies scholar, “Prophecy in the Present Tense: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee Pilgrimage, and Dreams Coming True,” article published in 2014</p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Enslaved persons’ uprisings strengthened Confederate control over Southern states such as South Carolina.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The Union Army’s strategy during the Civil War was unaffected by the persistence of slavery in the South.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Both before and during the Civil War, abolitionists helped enslaved African Americans flee the South.</p>","<p class=\"dap_body\"><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(30,30,30);\">The increased demand for labor during the Civil War led to an improvement in conditions for enslaved people in the South.</span></p>"],"answer":"1709848899640.1775"}]
