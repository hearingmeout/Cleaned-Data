In Buffalo, abolitionists challenged officials who captured an alleged fugitive named Daniel in the summer of 1851. Arguing that he was a free man, a large group—led by blacks—gathered at the courthouse and tried to liberate Daniel. After abolitionists filed a writ of habeas corpus, Daniel was released and fled to Canada. In Syracuse, the so-called Jerry Rescue again found local citizens openly defying authorities. The case centered on William Henry, an escaped slave from Kentucky who lived under the alias ‘Jerry’ before being seized by slave catchers in October 1851. Led by blacks, abolitionists stormed the prison and spirited Jerry away to Canada. For the next several years, local abolitionists celebrated Jerry's liberation day.</p><p class=\"dap_body\">In 1860, still another high-profile case occurred in Troy, New York, where officials claimed Charles Nalle was a fugitive slave from Virginia. A throng of activists demanded Nalle’s freedom, including Harriet Tubman, a former slave from Maryland who was already a noted figure on the Underground Railroad. On her way to an antislavery meeting in Boston, she heard about the Nalle case and literally threw her body in the way of slave catchers twice to foil Nalle’s return to bondage.”<br/> </p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Richard Newman, historian, <i>Abolitionism: A Very Short Introduction</i>, book published in 2018</p></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"dap_body\">Abolitionists continued to fight against the system of enslavement despite pro-slavery legislation. </p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 helped create the abolitionist movement in Northern states. </p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">Escaped slaves who made it to Northern states were protected from re-enslavement by federal legislation. </p>","<p class=\"dap_body\">The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 had little effect on African Americans living in states that prohibited slavery. </p>"],"answer":"1710115597797.6794"}]
