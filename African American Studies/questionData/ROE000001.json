My birthplace was Fut Tûr, between the two rivers. I sought knowledge under the instruction of a Sheikh called Mohammed Seid, my own brother, and Sheikh Soleiman Kembeh, and Sheikh Gabriel Abdal. I continued my studies twenty-five years. Then there came to our place a large army, who killed many men, and took me, and brought me to the great sea, and sold me into the hands of the Christians, who bound me and sent me on board [a] great ship and we sailed upon the great sea a month and a half, when we came to a place called Charleston in the Christian language. There they sold me to a small, weak, and wicked man, called Johnson, a complete infidel, who had no fear of God at all.”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: <i>The Autobiography of Omar ibn Seid, an Enslaved Muslim</i>, <span class=\"tts-container\" data-ssml-say-as=\"date\" ssml-label=\"Date\">1831</span></p></div>"}]}]
