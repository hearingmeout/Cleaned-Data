As he explained, ‘We propose to act in view of the settled fact that many...[African Americans] are already resolved to look for homes beyond the boundaries of the United States, and that most of their minds are turned towards Haiti.’ Yet, in a powerful stroke of fate, Douglass never made the journey to Haiti; before they had a chance to embark, shots were fired at Fort Sumter and the Civil War commenced. The war prompted Douglass and many other Black leaders to relinquish their emigration schemes...in hopes that slavery might be vanquished and the battle for suffrage might eventually succeed. As Douglass explained, ‘This is no time for us to leave the country.... We shall stay here and watch the current of events, and serve the cause of freedom and mankind.’ In July of 1861, Frederick Douglass simply declared bluntly and unequivocally: ‘I am not an Emigrationist.’”</p><p class=\"dap_body\" style=\"text-align:right;\">Source: Leslie M.
