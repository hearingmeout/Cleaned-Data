In 1979, the near-meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania alarmed the public over the potential hazards of nuclear power. These concerns were further exacerbated by the events at Chernobyl in 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Societal concerns about nuclear power and increased costs associated with the construction and operation of nuclear generating plants have led to a virtual moratorium on new plant construction. In the United States, no new orders for nuclear power plants have been placed since 1979. Even Energy Department officials are now reluctant to predict that another nuclear reactor will ever be built in this country.</p>\n\n<p>Nuclear power plants currently generate 21 percent of United States electricity and the 110 nuclear power plants across the nation are operating more efficiently and safely now than ever before. Some officials believe that if we do not continue research on nuclear energy, then we will not have a viable economy in 30 years.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A diagram of a nuclear power plant is shown.

An arrow indicates that there is flow through this tube. A tube flows up out of the rectangle through which the previous tube was winding, and this outlet tube is labeled C.

While take an inventory of the species present on the forest floor, Professor Peter Tate discovered many earthworms of an Asian species not previously known to live in this area. The Asian worms, unlike native worms, have voracious appetites. The forest floor is home to a myriad of species that live in the leaf litter, which is composed of seven years’ accumulation of slowly decomposing leaves. Dr. Tate explained that “the leaf litter is critical to the survival of local species of forest plants.” Dr. Tate has found the Asian worms, unlike their indigenous cousins, consumer the entire layer of litter in a single season. He said, “This sets the stage for the takeover by invasive exotics such as Japanese still grass.” Dr. Tate and other scientists are exploring strategies for the control of the Asian worms. \" height=\"362\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/6e7e13f3fc3f84d44874ff5e78c9a142/original.jpg\" width=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p>(a) Support Dr. Tate's assertion that \"the leaf litter is critical to the survival of local species of forest plants.\" Include in your discussion the roles of leaf litter in a deciduous forest ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Describe THREE abiotic changes that would be likely to result if the exotic worms consumed all the leaf litter in a single year.</p>\n\n<p>(c) For one of the changes you identified in part (b), explain how the change could set the stage for the takeover of Japanese stilt grass or other exotic species.</p>\n\n<p>(d) Design a controlled experiment to determine whether the worms, in fact, do change the forest ecosystem.

and China</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>\"Contaminated industrial sites in India and China top a new ranking of the world’s most polluted places, where millions of people are threatened by various chemical pollutants,” said Dr. Egguen, president of Fremont Friends of the Planet, an environmental advocacy organization. She said that the industrial town of Vapi, India, is a new addition to the list of worst-polluted places on Earth, based on the magnitude of the pollution and the number of people who are put at risk. She said, “Thousands of children, who are especially susceptible to toxic pollutants, are sick and dying in these top ten polluted places.”</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Egguen pointed out that mining and unregulated industrial production are the major culprits behind the menacing pollution. She described Vapi as a region overwhelmed by more than 50 chemical manufactures that poison the local soils and groundwater with toxic pollutants such as PCBs, mercury, and lead. In fact, levels of heavy metals found in local produce are 60 times greater than those found in produce grown in unpolluted areas.</p>\n\n<p>(a) Choose any ONE of the three pollutants mentioned above and respond to each of the following.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Describe one specific source, other than the local chemical plants, for the toxic pollutant you chose.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Describe how the pollutant you chose enters the human body and one specific effect it can have on human health.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Describe TWO specific steps, other than an outright ban, that a city or nation can take to reduce the threat posed by this pollutant.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(b) Give one reason why Dr. Egguen is correct in asserting that children are particularly susceptible to toxic pollutants.</p>\n\n<p>(c) An important contributor to global climate change is the release of CO2 from the rapidly increasing number of coal-burning power plants in China. Assume that the coal burned at these plants to provide the power to manufacture a single MP3 player releases 40 kg of CO2 and that it costs $0.75 to capture 1 kg of CO2 and keep it from entering the atmosphere. Determine the cost, in dollars, to capture the total amount of CO2 released from manufacturing one MP3 player.</p>\n\n<p>(d) Coal-burning power plants also release other pollutants, including nitrogen oxides ( NOx ), sulfur oxides ( SOx ), and particulates. Select one of these pollutants and identify one technology that can be used to remove it from the waste stream of coal-burning power plants.</p>\n\n<p>(e) Discuss TWO reasons why a multinational company would choose to build a manufacturing facility in India and/or China rather than in the United States or Europe.</p>\n","o":null,"a":null,"f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","Unit:7","Skill:Skill 7.B: Describe potential responses or approaches to environmental problems.","Skill:Skill 6.C: Calculate an accurate numeric answer with appropriate units.","Skill:Skill 6.B: Apply appropriate mathematical relationships to solve a problem, with work shown (e.g., dimensional analysis).","Topic:7.6: Reduction of Air Pollutants","Skill:Skill 3.C: Describe the author's reasoning (use of evidence to support a claim).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:FRQ","Practice:Practice 7: Propose and justify solutions to environmental problems.","Practice:Practice 6: Apply quantitative methods to address environmental concepts.","Practice:Practice 3: Analyze sources of information about environmental issues."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368211,368217,368236,368239,368220,368234,368247,368251,368253,368100,368109,368112,368127,368129,368130,368131,368133,367614,367615,367681,367686,367928,367951,367983,368065,368076],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Quantitative Data"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["FRQ"],"Stimulus Format":["Text"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT537326":{"id":"FT537326","q":{"id":"FT537326","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p>Termites are social insects that are essential decomposers in tropical rain forest ecosystems. Termites may account for up to 95 percent of insect biomass in tropical rain forests. Termites consume vast amounts of dead and decomposing plant material, thanks to the work of mutualistic cellulose-digesting microorganisms that inhabit their guts. In addition to their roles as important decomposers, termites digest plant materials and directly contribute to carbon dioxide and methane emissions into the atmosphere. It is likely that, like many insect species, termites and their symbionts may be sensitive to changes in their microclimate caused by global climate change, especially with regard to temperature and humidity.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 4 columns and 6 rows.

answer the questions that follow.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A picture of an article is shown. At the top it reads Fremont Examiner. The title of the article is Microalgae for Fuel Production: Can Green Goo Solve our Energy and Climate Problems? The text reads: Scientists and investors are promoting the potential of some of the smallest, oiliest critters on Earth as a solution to our energy problems. Although the humble organisms look like green goo, some species of microalgae are over 50 percent oil. Scientists say microalgae are the most efficient organisms at converting sunlight to energy. In fact they beat other oil crops for production per acre, hands down. Seventy percent of this oil can be recovered by pressing the algae; over 90 percent can be recovered by solvent extraction. The resulting oil can be used for heating, for electricity generation, or for making other fuels, like biodiesel. After the oil is removed, the remaining material can be used as animal feed or soil amendment. The Germans are even looking into using it for construction material. “In this way, we sequester that carbon indefinitely,” says Dr. Klaus Mueller. Some scientists are bubbling emissions from coal-burning power plants through algae-filled tanks to remove C O 2. Proponents claim that microalgae can be used to capture nutrients from animal feedlot waste lagoons and sewage treatment plants. Because they grow only in the top inch of water, the algae might even be grown in rooftop pools someday. But are microalgae all they’re cracked up to be? Like other monoculture crops, they may be susceptible to widespread damage from disease. Included with the text is a small table of collected date with a title that reads Gallons of Oil per Acre per Year.

In 2010, Coal produced approximately 1,800 billion kilowatt- hours of electricity. Natural Gas produced approximately 50 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950, increased steadily to approximately 400 billion kilowatt-hours in 1970, and then declined slightly to 250 billion kilowatt-hours by 1988. Natural Gas increased steadily from 1988 to the peak in 2010, when it produced 1,000 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Nuclear energy first appeared in 1968 and produced 250 billion kilowatt-hours by 1980.

Renewable sources of energy produced about 100 billion kilowatt-hours in 1950 and slowly and steadily increased to 450 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity by 2010. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/97a405ee7caea51b11724f2f49844cfe/original.png\"/></p><p>Which of the following is the most valid inference regarding electricity production, based on the graph above?</p>","o":[{"v":"i0","l":"<p>Electricity production from coal began to decrease in 2008 because of shortages in coal supplies.</p>"},{"v":"i1","l":"<p>Electricity production from coal began to decrease in 2008 because of the increasing use of natural gas and renewable energy.</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p>The use of nuclear energy increased from 1970 to 2010 because of the low cost of constructing nuclear power plants.</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p>The use of nuclear energy increased from 1970 to 2010 because of shortages in coal supplies.</p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p>Renewable energy has not increased as much as nuclear energy has since 1970 because of federal laws restricting construction of wind farms.</p>"}],"a":"i1","f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","Unit:6","Skill:Skill 5.A: Describe patterns or trends in data.","Topic:6.2: Global Energy Consumption","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Practice:Practice 5: Analyze and interpret quantitative data represented in tables, charts, and graphs."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368197,368199,368247,368251,368253,368100,368121,368122,367614,367722,367753,367757,367762],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Quantitative Data"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["No"],"Stimulus Format":["Chart/graph"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT537653":{"id":"FT537653","q":{"id":"FT537653","t":"mcq","s":"<p>Which of the following age structure diagrams represents a population that most likely has a negative growth rate?</p>","o":[{"v":"i0","l":"<img alt=\"Option A presents an age-structure diagram in which the bars at the base are approximately the same size, tapering toward the top.\" class=\"lrn-image-left\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/56981c15-05f3-43a4-8979-27569e3967d2.JPG\" width=\"121\">"},{"v":"i1","l":"<img alt=\"Option B presents an age-structure diagram that has the shape of a pyramid with a very wide base and a very pointed peak.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/595c0967-b300-4c20-8ff4-6e42096c0b54.JPG\" width=\"139\">"},{"v":"i2","l":"<img alt=\"Option C presents an age-structure diagram that has a moderate base, is widest just below the middle, and narrows toward the top.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/959a44b1-f5dd-4de5-838c-b90863a13897.png\" width=\"121\">"},{"v":"i3","l":"<img alt=\"Option D presents an age-structure diagram that has a narrow base, increases to its widest point about halfway up the diagram, and then begins to narrow again.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/f726d03c-8372-4a26-beca-1164246372f9.JPG\" width=\"121\">"},{"v":"i4","l":"<img alt=\"Option E presents an age-structure diagram that has the shape of a pyramid with a moderate base that tapers to a somewhat pointed peak.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/3b33cdeb-8aa0-42dc-8619-3ca22c7ccc52.JPG\" width=\"121\">"}],"a":"i3","f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","Unit:3","Skill:Skill 2.A: Describe characteristics of an environmental concept, process, or model represented visually.","Topic:3.6: Age Structure Diagrams","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Practice:Practice 2: Analyze visual representations of environmental concepts and processes."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368159,368165,368247,368251,368253,368100,368105,368106,367614,367615,367616,367617,367618],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Qualitative Data"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["No"],"Stimulus Format":["Diagram/model"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT537654":{"id":"FT537654","q":{"id":"FT537654","t":"mcq","s":"<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 7 columns and 6 rows.

W N S is a fungal disease that is decimating bat populations across eastern North American forests, with mortality rates reaching up to 100 percent at many sites. W N S has been found in at least 25 states in the United States and 5 Canadian provinces.</p><p><br> The fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) grows well in cool conditions such as those found in caves and has been observed as white patches on the muzzles, noses, ears, and wings of many cave-dwelling bats. W N S has caused significant population declines for several bat species, including once-numerous species such as the little brown bat. (Myotis lucifugus).</p><p><br> Little brown bats hunt using echolocation by emitting up to 200 high-frequency calls per second when pursuing their prey. When healthy, the little brown bat can live up to ten years and have one or two offspring (called pups) each year.</p><p><br> “Little brown bats provide tremendous value to the United States economy every year by the essential services they provide to farmers and other people. We need to understand how this deadly disease spreads and attempt to help reduce its impact on the little brown bat and other bat species,” said Dr. Duke Serach of the Fremont office of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Dr. Serach concluded with “It may yet be possible to save the little brown bats, but the remaining population will be alarmingly small.”</p></blockquote><p>(a)  Diseases can devastate populations; however, most diseases do not drive their host to extinction. Provide one explanation for why diseases seldom cause extinction.</p><p>(b)  Dr. Serach suggests that even if the impact of WNS on little brown bat populations can be reduced and the extinction of the species avoided, the bat populations are likely to remain alarmingly small.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><li><p>Describe TWO threats (other than WNS) to the survival of the bat species if the total number of bats becomes very small.</p></li><li><p>If the little brown bat species does not become extinct and can potentially recover, the rate of recovery is likely to be slow. Discuss one aspect of bat biology that might slow the recovery of little brown bat populations to pre-WNS numbers.</p></li></ol><p>(c)  Bats are found in ecosystems around the world. Describe TWO ways in which other organisms in an ecosystem could be affected by a decline in a bat population.</p><p>(d)  The Eastern deciduous forest in which the little brown bats live is an important ecosystem. Identify TWO ecosystem services that forests provide, and explain how each service benefits human society.</p><p>WNS is an emerging disease in bats. Humans are also subject to emerging diseases, such as Ebola. A recent study suggests that the number of emerging infectious diseases affecting human populations has been steadily increasing in recent decades.</p><p>(e)  Provide a likely reason for the increase in emerging infectious diseases affecting human populations.

Speaking for the Planning Board, Dr. David Loxsom explained to the 250 Fremont residents in attendance that the city needs to convert some of its woodlands to a landfill. Dr. Loxsom provided the diagram reproduced at the right, showing the urbanized northern tier of Fremont, State Highway 123, and the three tracts of municipal land osuth of the city (labeled Tract A, Track B, Tract C). According to Dr. Loxsom, the city currently trucks its municipal solid waste to a privately owned dump located about 50 miles north of the city. One-third of the city sanitation budget is spent on dumping fees and trucking costs associated with using this private dump. Dr. Federick Hong of the Save Our Wood Turtle Alliance spoke next. He opposed the destruction of any of the municipal land in south Fremont because each tract is suitable turtle habitat Several other residents spoke about the landfill and the turtle. As the Examiner went to press, there was consensus for building a landfill on one tract and setting aside the other two tracts to protect the turtle's habitat, but no agreement had been reached as to which land should be preserved.&quot; An image depicts an urban area split by the State highway 123 with a dump site at the north.

During a major storm event, however, the combined volume of storm water and sewage may exceed the plant’s capacity, and the overflow bypasses the FWTP. The untreated overflow is discharged into Fremont Creek along with the treated waste. Recently parts of Fremont received 5 cm of rain in 60 minutes.

Yet once in a while, some insect species do make the front page -- sometimes because their populations are exploding and other times because they seem to be performing a disappearing act. Examples of such species are the mountain pine beetle and the European honeybee.<br>\nIn the western United States, outbreaks of forest destruction caused by mountain pine beetles have been recorded since the late 1880s. But in the past few decades, mountain pine beetles have been killing mature trees (preferred targets of the beetles) at accelerated rates, and now millions of acres of pine forests have been affected. Fire-suppression policies, the practice of clear-cutting, and lowered winter mortality of beetle larvae have all been implicated in causing the epidemic proportions of the beetles' forest-destroying activities.<br>\nWhile mountain pine beetle populations are booming, European honeybees are in trouble. Many valuable food crops are dependent on pollination by honeybees, yet the number of managed honeybee colonies has dropped significantly since the 1970s due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), which is characterized by the sudden disappearance of all the worker bees in a colony. Recent scientific research suggests that many stress factors of anthropogenic origin are the culprits in CCD. Some farmers are trying to use fewer colonies to pollinate their crops, some are hoping that other natural pollinators (e.g., native wild bees, other insects, bats) will do the job of pollination for them.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>As mentioned in the article, there are several possible explanations for the increase in mountain pine beetles.</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Provide one reason why fire-suppression policies lead to increased beetle activity.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Reduced winter mortality of beetle larvae is likely a consequence of global climate change.

In some off-the-grid locations as near as one-quarter mile from the power lines, stand-alone photovoltaic systems can be more cost-effective than extending power lines. Direct-coupled systems need no electrical storage because they operate only during daylight hours, but most systems rely on battery storage so that energy produced during the day can be used at night. Some systems, called hybrid systems, combine solar power with additional power sources such as wind or diesel.<br>\n<br>\nGrid-connected photovoltaic systems supply surplus power back through the grid to the utility and take from the utility grid when the home system’s power supply is low. These systems remove the need for battery storage, although arranging for the grid interconnection can be difficult.

Most of the time it is harmless, but eat enough and it can make you sick. Too much mercury can damage the nervous system, especially the brain, and too much in pregnant and breast-feeding women can hurt their babies - adversely affecting children's intelligence, coordination, and memory. But how much is too much? Are adults at risk as well? Public concern about these questions is prompting public-health officials to look more seriously at mercury in the environment and its effects. Because there are no conclusive long-term studies on humans, government officials disagree on what constitutes safe exposure levels. There are those who say mercury in seafood is a very real menace and a major threat to child development. Burning fossil fuel releases mercury into the environment and this will only get worse as our dependence on coal increases. Others say the threat is overblown and that the benefits of eating fish far outweigh the worries. The fact is, no one knows.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>On the basis of the article above, indicate one human activity that releases mercury into the environment.

Only recently however, have scientists established a possible link between climate change and health-related epidemics. Every few years a dramatic climate shift known as the El Nino-South Oscillation (ENSO) disrupts the normal interaction between ocean and atmosphere and alters the normal pattern of water temperatures and winds. ENSOs occur every 3 to 5 years and typically last from several months to over a year. During an El Nino, normal climate patterns are severely disrupted and the longer the phenomenon lasts, the more disruptive it can be. When an ENSO lasts 12 months or longer it can also disrupt populations of oceanic and other aquatic organisms and set off a series of environmental problems throughout the world. Recently scientists studying ENSOs established a link between the climate-related changes during an El Nino event and the spread of such diseases as cholera and yellow fever.<br>\n<br>\nThe linkage apparently is the result of changing surface temperatures during the event, producing conditions suitable for the rapid spread of various vector-transmitted diseases in affect areas. The same changing conditions are also linked to several other environmental problems.<br>\n<br>\nRecently, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in German reported that, based on a computer simulated model, human-induced global warming effects ENSOs. THe model predicts more frequent El Nino events with increases in greenhouse gases, and if this model is correct, then we can expect further increases in disease epidemics in various parts of the world.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Describe what an El Niño is and clearly indicate where it occurs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Describe the connection between the climate change associated with an El Niño and the transmission of diseases.

Over the past decade some headlines have heralded that “trash is treasure” while others have proclaimed that “recycling is garbage.”</p>\n\n<p>The antagonists in these debates are disagreeing over public policy and its role in shaping decisions about resource use. Both sides in these debates frequently have broad policy agendas that go far beyond choosing the most efficient way to manage solid waste. Both sides also promote their political agendas with unsupported assertions and incomplete information. Determining what amount of recycling will result inefficient resource use requires systematic analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of recycling argue that recycling saves resources. For example, most manufacturers of aluminum cans currently depend on recycled aluminum for more than 50% of their needs. This recycled input reduces the economic and environmental costs associated with mining and landfills.</p>\n\n<p>A common argument for the anti-recycling side is that recycling wastes resources. It takes resources to recycle. For example, it takes human effort to sort aluminum cans from other trash and energy to move aluminum cans from the consumer back to the manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p>It may not make economic sense to recycle all materials or all of any single material, but numerous studies have shown that there are net benefits to society at low or modest levels of recycling most materials. The question is, Which has the higher environmental cost: using recovered materials or using virgin materials? Do recovered or virgin materials cost more in resources? The answer is complex and changing.</p>\n\n<p>Your next environmental decision is fast approaching. Should you put this copy of <em>The Fremont Daily</em> in the recycling bin or should you put it in the trash?</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Consider the arguments regarding aluminum presented in the editorial, then make</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>a similar argument in favor of recycling the newspaper, and</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>a similar argument against recycling the newspaper.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For each of the following, describe <u>two</u> pieces of scientific information that would be needed to evaluate</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>the environmental benefits of recycling the newspaper, and</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>the environmental costs of recycling the newspaper.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If a community can afford to begin a recycling program for either aluminum or newspaper, but not both, which one would you recommend to be recycled?

Each pyramid has bars going to the left of the vertical axis for male and to the right of the vertical axis for female. The first pyramid on the left shows the number of people in country X in millions, and the x-axis goes from 0 to 10 on either side of the vertical axis. The bars start out long on the bottom with the first bar going out to 10 and then get progressively shorter as they go up. The first three bars are dark grey, and the third bar goes out to about 7 on each side. Going up, the next six bars are white with the first going out to about 7 on each side and the sixth going out to less than 1 on each side. The last 7 bars are light grey with the first going out to about 4 on each side and the last going out to less than 1 on each side. The pyramid is visually symmetric around the vertical axis. The second pyramid in the middle shows the number of people in country Y in millions, and the x-axis goes from 0 to 4 on either side of the vertical axis. The bars are fairly constant in length until the last few at the top. The first three bars are dark grey and the third bar goes out to about 3 on each side. Going up, the next six bars are white with the first going out to about 3 on each side and the sixth going out to 2.5 on each side. The last 7 bars are light grey with the first going out to about 2.5 on each side. From here, bars on both side begin to gradually decrease with the last bar at about 0 for male on one side and 1 for female on the other side.

The bars start out long on the bottom with the first bar going out to 10 and then getting slightly shorter as they go up. The first three bars are dark grey, both appearing to remain at about 8 on each side. Going up, the next six bars are white with the first remaining at about 8 on each side and the sixth at about 6 on each side. The last 7 bars are light grey with the first at about 6 on each side.

Ewoldsen noted that while posing a different threat than more conventional water pollutants such as nitrates, phosphates and PCB’s, tiny beads of plastic contained in many products, especially cosmetics, now threaten plankton and small fish that ingest the particles because they mistake them for food. The microbeads cannot be digestedand can fill or block the digestive tracts of the fish, leading to starvation. In addition, surfaces of these small spheres can adsorb organic pollutants such as PCBs and dioxin.When asked about steps to reduce this threat, Ewoldsen noted that the beads are so small that they are not easily removed by wastewater treatment plants and thus often enter aquatic ecosystems in wastewater discharges.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/7d414eed359b5cf6bf0e8a44234646be/original.png\"/></p><p>(a) <strong>Describe </strong>TWO effects that ingesting microbeads has on aquatic organisms.</p><p></p><p>(b) Dr. Ewoldsen states that nitrates pose different threats to aquatic ecosystems than microbeads do. <strong>Describe </strong>how nitrate levels can negatively affect water quality in some aquatic ecosystems. </p><p></p><p>(c) While wastewater treatment plants are ineffective at removing microbeads, they are very effective at removing large pieces of plastic waste and other pollutants. </p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><li><p><strong>Identify</strong> one way large pieces of plastic are removed from wastewater during primary treatment. </p></li><li><p>Prior to discharge, wastewater is often disinfected. <strong>Identify </strong>one technique commonly used to disinfect wastewater.</p></li><li><p>Sludge or biosolids produced during the wastewater treatment process can be spread on agricultural fields. <strong>Identify </strong>one advantage and one disadvantage of this practice.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>(d) Coastal ecosystems are threatened by other human activities in addition to wastewater disposal.

SCHOOL!</strong><br>A group of students from Fremont High School addressed the city council last night and proposed that one of the existing buildings at Fremont High School, which was built in 1970, be renovated to take advantage of recent advances in green technology. Currently the heat for the school is provided by fossil fuel combustion. The students said that the redesigned building would reduce the school’s carbon footprint, which is a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds released by various human activities. Incorporating specific features that conserve energy and utilize renewable energy sources can help reduce the carbon footprint. <br>Councilperson Gail Fassler praised the idea, saying that the project could conserve local water resources, and act as a “shining beacon” of sustainability for the greater Fremont community. Fassler suggested the project could even incorporate a living green roof as an additional sustainable feature. The council approved the initial site planning request and urged students to report back when the project was under way.</p></blockquote><p></p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"><li><p>The students want to reduce the school’s carbon footprint. </p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><li><p><strong>Define</strong> carbon footprint. </p></li><li><p><strong>Identify</strong> one way the school’s heating system is likely adding to the school’s carbon footprint. </p></li><li><p><strong>Describe</strong> one realistic way to reduce the contribution of the heating system to the school’s carbon footprint.  </p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Identify</strong> TWO environmental benefits of a living green roof, such as that suggested by Councilperson Fassler. </p></li><li><p><strong>Describe</strong> TWO practices the cafeteria’s food service could use to decrease the environmental impacts of Fremont High School.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discuss</strong> TWO benefits of using native plants for landscaping at Fremont High School. </p></li><li><p>During the renovation, the carpeting must be replaced.

An international team of researchers reported new evidence of reef fish adjusting to global warming conditions at the genetic level. [R]esearchers . . . have found that reef fish can inherit from their parents the genetic tools to adjust to ocean warming. “When parents are exposed to an increase in water temperature, we found that their offspring improved their performance in these otherwise stressful conditions by selectively modifying their epigenome.” Epigenetic change refers to chemical modifications in the DNA that signals genes to be switched on or off. A range of factors, including disease, famine, or in the case of this research, heat stress, can stimulate these subtle changes.</p>\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In this study, when both parent and offspring experienced the same elevated water temperatures, responsive changes . . . were observed that enhanced the next generation’s ability to cope with the new, warmer temperatures. “We reared spiny chromis damselfish . . . for two generations under three different water temperatures, up to 3 degrees Celsius warmer than current-day ocean temperatures. The next generation appeared to be advantaged by parental exposure to elevated temperatures. The offspring’s altered gene expression, also referred to as ‘acclimation,’ allowed them to maximize oxygen consumption and energy use.” “Acclimation may buffer populations against the impacts of rapid environmental change and provide time for genetic adaptation to catch up over the longer term.”</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">“Reef fish inherit tolerance to warming oceans: Thanks to mom and dad, baby reef fish may have to what it takes to adjust to hotter oceans,” Ryu Taewoo, ScienceDaily, April 30, 2018.</span></span>\n</div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best identifies the author’s claim?</p>\n","o":[{"v":"i1","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Observed adjustments in the ecological tolerance of a species of reef fish is a result of epigenetic changes.</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Climate change is damaging coral reefs as a result of warming ocean waters, which affect reef fish survival.</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Transferring specific gene sequences of the spiny chromis damselfish to other fish species will help populations acclimate to warming ocean temperatures.</p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Continued acclimation of fish populations through epigenetics to warmer oceans will eventually replace the process of natural selection.</p>"}],"a":"i1","f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","14_PPC:2.4|Skill 3.A","Unit:2","Topic:2.4: Ecological Tolerance","Skill:Skill 3.A: Identify the author's claim.","Assessment Type:Formative","Question Type:MCQ","Practice:Practice 3: Analyze sources of information about environmental issues."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368151,368155,368247,368248,413881,368100,368109,368110,367614,367816,367848,367864,367865],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["No Stimulus"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Discrete","No"],"Stimulus Format":["Text"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VH904679":{"id":"VH904679","q":{"id":"VH904679","t":"mcq","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best describes a symbiotic relationship?</p>\n","o":[{"v":"i1","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Striped bass and bluefish eat the same variety of mackerel.</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Intestinal bacteria inhabit the gut of humans.</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Mountain lions feed on white-tailed deer.</p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Marsupial animals carry their young in a pouch.</p>"}],"a":"i2","f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","Unit:1","Skill:Skill 1.A: Describe environmental concepts and processes.","Topic:1.1: Introduction to Ecosystems","Assessment Type:Formative","Question Type:MCQ","Practice:Practice 1: Explain environmental concepts, processes, and models presented in written format."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368139,368140,368247,368248,368249,368100,368101,368102,367614,367816,367817,367818,367820],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["No Stimulus"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Discrete","No"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VH904680":{"id":"VH904680","q":{"id":"VH904680","t":"mcq","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In a given ecosystem, producers convert solar energy into <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"15,000 kilocalories\"><math alttext=\"15,000 kilocalories\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>000</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>kcal</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> of chemical energy stored in organic compounds.

By mid-January, the dead reptiles—some the length of two tall men, lined up end to end—numbered in the dozens. By March, more than 110 of the skinny-snouted creatures had been found dead, most along a 30-kilometer (18-mile) stretch of river.</p>\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Among the largest crocodilians in the world, gharials have long, heavy bodies and relatively small heads with bulging eyes and skinny snouts. Although their rows of pointy teeth look menacing, they are specialized for catching and holding onto fish, and pose little danger to people.</p>\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The relatively healthy breeding population on the Chambal is precisely why the massive 2008 die-off here caused such alarm. The Chambal contains nearly 80 percent of all the gharials left on Earth. It is the only population large enough to be stable. Speculation ensued among researchers and government officials about what caused the die-off.</p>\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Early theories focused on widespread pollution. Based on a variety of clues, however, [researchers suspect] illegal or accidental dumping of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac that was once commonly used on livestock but was banned in India in 2006. A few years earlier, also in South Asia, the drug was responsible for a sharp decline of vultures, which all showed signs of kidney dysfunction like the dead gharials examined in 2008.</p>\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The die-off . . . illustrates the potentially catastrophic consequences that disruptions to water bodies can have on aquatic species that are close to the brink. For a species that is struggling, the fate of this river will determine its future.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Article Information: Sohn, E.

The heading for column 2 is “Period.” The heading for column 3 is “Relative Changes in Sea Level” There are 2 subheadings for column 3, which are as follows: “Falling,” with an arrow pointing to the left, and “Rising,” with an arrow pointing to the right. A dashed line labeled “Sea Level Today,” extends from the top of the third column to the bottom.  A curve in the third column illustrates the changes in sea level during the different time periods. For most of the periods, the sea levels remain above the current sea level. The curve begins in the Cambrian period, to the left of the dashed line. It moves slightly upward, and sharply to the right until it reaches a point far to the right of the dashed line at 500. It then generally decreases until it reaches a point just to the left of the dashed line again in the Permian period, between 200 and 300. The curve then slightly increases for a short period of time, before slightly decreasing back to the left the dashed line in the Jurassic period between 100 and 200.

The vertical axis is labeled “Difference from Average Temperature, in degrees Celsius,” and the numbers negative 2 through 2, in increments of 1, are indicated. A horizontal line labeled “1981 through 2010 average,” is drawn at 0 on the vertical axis. One line graph represents “Arctic,” and one line graph represents “global.” The behavior for the Arctic line graph is as follows. It begins on the vertical axis in 1900 at approximately negative 1.5. It spikes initially, reaching negative 1, just to the right of the vertical axis, before moving steeply downward and reaching a low at approximately negative 2.5. It then moves upward again until it reaches a point just above negative 1, and generally stays around this value until just before 1920. At this point, the line graph moves steeply downward and to the right reaching a low at approximately negative 2 near 1920. It then moves generally upward until it reaches a peak at approximately 0.5 around 1940. From this point, it moves generally downward until it reaches a low of approximately negative 2 around 1970. Then, the graph moves generally upward again until it ends just above 1 in 2016. The behavior of the global line generally follows the behavior of the arctic line, but with significantly less variation between the peak points and the low points. It begins on the vertical axis in 1900 at approximately negative 0.6, peaks briefly at approximately negative 0.4, just to the right of the vertical axis. It then reaches a low at negative 1, before moving generally upward until it reaches approximately negative 0.3 around 1950. At this point, the graph stays relatively steady between the values negative 0.3 and negative 0.8 until about 1980. Beginning around 1980, the graph generally moves upward and to the right until it ends at approximately 0.5 in 2016.\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH965556.g05.png\" width=\"544\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Refer to the graph above to answer the following questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">i.

Activities such as finding desirable habitat and mates, avoiding predators, protecting young, and establishing territories are all dependent on the acoustical environment. [Wildlife is] being forced to adapt to increasing noise levels. Research shows that males of at least one frog species are adapting to traffic noise by calling at a higher pitch. This could be problematic for the females, because they prefer lower-pitched calls, which indicate larger and more experienced males.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In general, studies indicate that animals are stressed by noisy environments. The endangered Sonoran pronghorn avoids noisy areas frequented by military jets; female frogs exposed to traffic noise have more difficulty locating the male's signal; bats avoid hunting in areas with road noise. Combined with other stressors such as winter weather, disease, and food shortages, sound impacts can have important implications for the health and vitality of wildlife populations within a park.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">National parks are under increasing noise pressure. Noise levels in park transportation corridors today are many times the natural level. Sound levels during peak periods in a high air traffic corridor in the Yellowstone backcountry, for example, were elevated by up to 5 decibels. The result is as much as a 70% reduction in the size of an area in which predators can hear their prey. Increasingly, careful consideration of the impacts of human-generated noise on wildlife is a critical component of management for healthy ecosystems in our parks.</p></div></div></div>"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM Environmental Science","14_PPC:7.8|Skill 3.C","Unit:7","Skill:Skill 3.C: Describe the author's reasoning (use of evidence to support a claim).","Topic:7.8: Noise Pollution","Assessment Type:Formative","Question Type:MCQ","Practice:Practice 3: Analyze sources of information about environmental issues."]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368211,368219,368247,368248,413881,368100,368109,368112,367614,367928,367951,367996,367999],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Text-based Stimulus"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Classification","Yes"],"Stimulus Format":["Text"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VH973852":{"id":"VH973852","q":{"id":"VH973852","t":"mcq","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A student is setting up a model to study the carbon cycle and natural sources of carbon dioxide.

The earth's crust shows underground deposits of limestone, oil and gas, and coal. On the earth's surface there are plants and animals as well as the outline of an oil well and a car next to a gasoline pump. A series of arrows are drawn; three arrows point upward toward the atmosphere and two arrows point downward away from the atmosphere. One downward arrow goes to the body of water and a label C O 2 in water, which continues through the label decaying organic matter, which points into calcium carbonate sediments. In the water, a label for photosynthesis (aquatic food chains) also points to the calcium carbonate sediments. In the water there is another label for plankton and two arrows, one that points to a fish and the other to organic sediments. Two arrows labeled over time respectively lead from calcium carbonate sediments to a deposit of limestone and from organic sediments to a deposit of oil and gas. The second arrow pointing downward from the atmosphere points to label photosynthesis (terrestrial food chains) and to land based plants and animals, which in turn has an arrow labeled over time that leads to a deposit of coal. Oil and gas are shown being pumped to the surface and going into an automobile. A line from the underground coal joins a line from the automobile in an arrow labeled combustion of fossil fuels that points upward to the atmosphere. Another arrow labeled burning of forests, and organic debris points up from a tree to the atmosphere.

Plovers were nearly hunted to extinction in the nineteenth century.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Plovers prefer to nest and search for food on open sandy beaches between sparsely vegetated sand dunes. Washovers, where sand is washed up from the beach and buries vegetated areas during big storms, are also important to plovers because they provide moist and undisturbed habitat for plover adults and their chicks. Ecologists with the Elliott Oceanographic Institute mapped the distribution of plover nests during two seasonal surveys of nesting sites over a ten-year period on Assateague Island. This is a barrier island, a long, narrow island running parallel to the Atlantic coast of Virginia.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a map titled “Spring Piping Plover Nesting Sites on Assateague Island, Virginia.” The full map shows a section of Maryland, Virginia, the Chincoteague Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. An enlarged section of the map shows Assateague Island, Virginia, and the mapping of the distribution of plover nests during two seasonal surveys of nesting sites over a ten-year period. The left portion of the map shows the distribution during the year 1999 and the right portion of the map shows the distribution during the year 2009. A key indicates that the following four categories are represented on the map: unvegetated sand, sparsely vegetated sand, densely vegetated sand, and piping plover nest.

The scientists plan to return to Barter Island at the end of the summer of 2019 to see whether the drone-based detection system can predict erosion hotspots through early identification of methane emissions.</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Credit: U.S. Geological Survey</span></span></div></div></div>"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB Environmental Science","Security:Teacher Use Only"]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368236,368241,368247,368251,368254,375458,368100,368115,368118,367614,367928,368065,368080,368083],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Text-based Stimulus"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Classification"],"Stimulus Format":["Text"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR095282":{"id":"VR095282","q":{"id":"VR095282","t":"mcq","s":"<div><include href=\"../Passage/VR095271.qti.xml\" xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\"></include></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the data in the graph, which of the following is closest to the average population growth rate per year from year <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"4\"><math alttext=\"4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> to year <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"7\"><math alttext=\"7\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>7</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> in the rabbit population?</p>\n","o":[{"v":"i1","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1342\"><math alttext=\"1342\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1342</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> rabbits per year</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1014\"><math alttext=\"1014\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1014</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> rabbits per year</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"338\"><math alttext=\"338\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>338</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> rabbits per year</p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"210\"><math alttext=\"210\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>210</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> rabbits per year</p>"}],"a":"i3","f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_ab7ccfba8f35feadd5f2241605b5a34f","c":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph with 7 data points titled “Growth of a Rabbit Population.” The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1 through 7 are indicated.

The vertical axis is labeled “Annual Erosion, in tons per acre,” and the numbers 0 through 30, in increments, of 5, are indicated. A key indicates the type of agricultural practice represented by each curve. One curve represents tillage, one curve represents no-till, one curve represents no-till and cover crop, and one curve represents crop rotation. A dashed horizontal line labeled “T equals tolerable loss,” begins at 4 on the vertical axis and extends through the graph. The behavior of each curve is as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The curve representing tillage begins at 1 on the vertical axis, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 1% and 4 tons per acre, and continues upward until it reaches 4.5% and 12 tons per acre. It then moves more steeply upward until it reaches a slope of 7% and 30 tons per acre. The curve representing no-till begins just above 0 on the vertical axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 7% and 4 tons per acre. It continues gradually upward and to the right, reaching 10 tons per acre at a slope of 12.5%, 20 tons per acre at a slope of 20%, and ending at 30 tons per acre at a slope of 26%.

It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 11% and 4 tons per acre. It continues gradually upward and to the right, reaching 10 tons per acre at a slope of 19%, and ending at 20.5 tons per acre at a slope of 30%. The curve representing crop rotation begins just above 0 on the vertical axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right.

Plots A, B, and C were each planted with seeds of different types of genetically modified strains of green beans. Plot D was planted with seeds of unmodified green beans. Each plot was given equal amounts of fertilizer, which contains phosphorus and nitrogen, and water and was irrigated using spray irrigation for one hour per day. Throughout the growing season, researchers measured the amount of green beans harvested within each plot. The plots with genetically modified beans had higher crop yields than the plot with unmodified beans.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> the control group in this experiment.</p></div>\n","o":null,"a":null,"f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB Environmental Science","14_PPC:2.1|Skill 1.A"]},"cat":{"t":[368138,368179,368182,368194,368151,368158,368152,368236,368244,368247,368251,368253,368100,368115,368117,368116,368120,368131,368133,368121,368125,368122,368123,368101,368103,368104,368102,367614,367816,367848,367877,367878,367849,367852,367615,367704,367705,367708,367707,367632,367638,367639,367928,367929,367940,367941],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Quantitative Data"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["FRQ"],"Stimulus Format":["Table"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR734084":{"id":"VR734084","q":{"id":"VR734084","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">Write your answers in the spaces provided.
