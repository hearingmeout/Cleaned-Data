[{"id":"FT539980_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Overall","stimulusHtml":"<p>This question asks students to take an alternative perspective on a main-line topic, connecting women’s history with elite politics. Many students were able to do so, and their answers were more than usually interesting overall. The question’s chronological span is wide, but because students could select two individuals to discuss, the task was manageable. Their potential range of choices of individual figures to discussis extensive, although the rulers most frequently chosen were Catherine the Great and Elizabeth I. Good responses integrated the two aspects of the question, linking gender issues with rulers’ obtaining and exercising power. The abler students went beyond the descriptors “marriage and reproduction” to identify other gender issues. Some students discussed consorts who never ruled on their own; those who substituted a consort for a ruler could not earn a score above the 4-5 range.</p><p></p><p><strong>8-9 points:</strong></p><p>Provides a balanced, comprehensive treatment of gender and power issues as successes and/or failures; Offers a full, sophisticated, analytical treatment of both rulers, with substantive, appropriate evidence; Makes only minor errors within the period of the question.</p><p><strong>6-7 points:</strong></p><p>Discusses gender and power issues as successes and/or failures, with some appropriate evidence; Treats two rulers, although perhaps unevenly, mundanely; May include major factual errors <em>outside </em>the chronological frame of the question.</p><p><strong>4-5 points:</strong> </p><p>Links gender to power in some way, as a success and/or failure, with at least one example; Discusses two women from within the prescribed chronological period (possibly one a consort), perhaps superficially; May include some major factual errors <em>within</em> the chronological frame of the question.</p><p><strong>2-3 points:</strong> </p><p>Barely understands gender issues, links them erroneously with power; Deals with only one or more than two rulers throughout the essay; Contains egregious factual errors.</p><p><strong>1 point:</strong></p><p>Does not understand gender or power issues; Discusses rule but not any specific ruler, or writes about rulers outside the chronological period of the question.</p><p><strong>0 points:</strong></p><p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more. </p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points","5 points","6 points","7 points","8 points","9 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"maxScores":[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9],"descriptions":["<p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more. </p>","<p>Does not understand gender or power issues; Discusses rule but not any specific ruler, or writes about rulers outside the chronological period of the question.</p>","<p>Barely understands gender issues, links them erroneously with power; Deals with only one or more than two rulers throughout the essay; Contains egregious factual errors.</p>","<p>Barely understands gender issues, links them erroneously with power; Deals with only one or more than two rulers throughout the essay; Contains egregious factual errors.</p>","<p>Links gender to power in some way, as a success and/or failure, with at least one example; Discusses two women from within the prescribed chronological period (possibly one a consort), perhaps superficially; May include some major factual errors <em>within</em> the chronological frame of the question.</p>","<p>Links gender to power in some way, as a success and/or failure, with at least one example; Discusses two women from within the prescribed chronological period (possibly one a consort), perhaps superficially; May include some major factual errors <em>within</em> the chronological frame of the question.</p>","<p>Discusses gender and power issues as successes and/or failures, with some appropriate evidence; Treats two rulers, although perhaps unevenly, mundanely; May include major factual errors <em>outside </em>the chronological frame of the question.</p>","<p>Discusses gender and power issues as successes and/or failures, with some appropriate evidence; Treats two rulers, although perhaps unevenly, mundanely; May include major factual errors <em>outside </em>the chronological frame of the question.</p>","<p>Provides a balanced, comprehensive treatment of gender and power issues as successes and/or failures; Offers a full, sophisticated, analytical treatment of both rulers, with substantive, appropriate evidence; Makes only minor errors within the period of the question.</p>","<p>Provides a balanced, comprehensive treatment of gender and power issues as successes and/or failures; Offers a full, sophisticated, analytical treatment of both rulers, with substantive, appropriate evidence; Makes only minor errors within the period of the question.</p>"]}]
