In one sense a narrow question, it nonetheless addresses a topic about which many students know something and poses a manageable task for a 30-minute response. Many students argued, explicitly or implicitly, that the Weimar Republic was doomed from its outset and the advent of a Nazi regime inevitable; although many historians believe otherwise, a well-documented paper alleging inevitability could certainly earn the top score. Many students, even very able ones, often made little distinction between discussion and analysis; however, they did distinguish politics and economics. In order to link these areas to one another and to the fall of Weimar, some sort of analysis, however implicit, was needed. Abler students recognized both political and economic problems over the entire 15-year span of the Republic.</p><p></p><p><strong>8-9 points:</strong></p><p>Analyzes both political and economic examples with balance, and sees the relationship between the two; Addresses many specific examples, though details may be limited because the answer must be succinct; May make minor factual errors.</p><p><strong>6-7 points:</strong></p><p>Addresses both political and economic aspects of the question, but perhaps unevenly; Shows solid but not detailed knowledge of some specific examples; May make some factual errors.</p><p><strong>4-5 points:</strong></p><p>Comprehends that the question asks for more than the rise of Nazism, and attempts to deal with political and economic issues that undermined German democracy; Addresses some specific examples, but probably fails to develop them adequately, perhaps confusing the chronology; May offer much descriptive discussion, but little real analysis; May make some significant factual errors if the major thrust of the argument is coherent.</p><p><strong>2-3 points:</strong></p><p>Brings minimal or confused information to the answer; Ignores most specific examples; Offers description but not analysis; Makes major or repeated factual errors without a cogent argument. </p><p><strong>1 point:</strong></p><p>Generalizes grossly without specific examples; Offers irrelevancies and/or gross factual errors.</p><p><strong>0 points:</strong><br>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points","5 points","6 points","7 points","8 points","9 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"maxScores":[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9],"descriptions":["<p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more. </p>","<p>Generalizes grossly without specific examples; Offers irrelevancies and/or gross factual errors.</p>","<p>Brings minimal or confused information to the answer; Ignores most specific examples; Offers description but not analysis; Makes major or repeated factual errors without a cogent argument.</p>","<p>Brings minimal or confused information to the answer; Ignores most specific examples; Offers description but not analysis; Makes major or repeated factual errors without a cogent argument.</p>","<p>Comprehends that the question asks for more than the rise of Nazism, and attempts to deal with political and economic issues that undermined German democracy; Addresses some specific examples, but probably fails to develop them adequately, perhaps confusing the chronology; May offer much descriptive discussion, but little real analysis; May make some significant factual errors if the major thrust of the argument is coherent.</p>","<p>Comprehends that the question asks for more than the rise of Nazism, and attempts to deal with political and economic issues that undermined German democracy; Addresses some specific examples, but probably fails to develop them adequately, perhaps confusing the chronology; May offer much descriptive discussion, but little real analysis; May make some significant factual errors if the major thrust of the argument is coherent.</p>","<p>Addresses both political and economic aspects of the question, but perhaps unevenly; Shows solid but not detailed knowledge of some specific examples; May make some factual errors.</p>","<p>Addresses both political and economic aspects of the question, but perhaps unevenly; Shows solid but not detailed knowledge of some specific examples; May make some factual errors.</p>","<p>Analyzes both political and economic examples with balance, and sees the relationship between the two; Addresses many specific examples, though details may be limited because the answer must be succinct; May make minor factual errors.</p>","<p>Analyzes both political and economic examples with balance, and sees the relationship between the two; Addresses many specific examples, though details may be limited because the answer must be succinct; May make minor factual errors.</p>"]}]
