[{"id":"FT539981_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Overall","stimulusHtml":"<p>This question asks students to analyze particular aspects of Enlightenment thought, but offers them a range of possibilities within the specified categories. For instance, some students discussed Deism extensively, while others focused on Enlightenment criticisms of the Roman Catholic Church.The phrasing leads students to focus on the content of philosophes’ ideas, although the best writers often paid some attention to how these ideas were publicized and implemented. The question does not specifically require identifying the individual proponents<br>of the ideas discussed, but sophisticated responses generally did so. These essays also tended to recognize complexities in Enlightenment thought, whereas lower-category responses often characterized ideas in a simpler, even simplistic, manner.</p><p></p><p><strong>8-9 points:</strong></p><p>Fully responds to the question, with a sophisticated thesis, analysis, and conclusion, showing a clear awareness of change over time; Includes discussion and analysis of both Enlightenment religious beliefs and thought on social issues.</p><p><strong>6-7 points:</strong></p><p>Discusses and analyzes Enlightenment thought on both religious beliefs and social issues, although discussion may be more thorough than analysis, and treatment of beliefs and issues may be unbalanced; Offers a number of examples, mainly accurate. </p><p><strong>4-5 points:</strong></p><p>Discusses mainly either religious beliefs or social issues, with some analysis, perhaps limited or unbalanced; Includes some specific examples, generally accurate.</p><p><strong>2-3 points:</strong></p><p>Discusses question superficially or partially (only religious beliefs or only social issues); Offers little or no analysis; Makes many factual errors; Includes many judgmental or argumentative statements.</p><p><strong>1 point:</strong></p><p>Fails to respond to the question at all, or responds only slightly, irrelevantly, inaccurately.</p><p><strong>0 points:<br></strong>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points","5 points","6 points","7 points","8 points","9 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"maxScores":[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9],"descriptions":["<p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more. </p>","<p>Fails to respond to the question at all, or responds only slightly, irrelevantly, inaccurately.</p>","<p>Discusses question superficially or partially (only religious beliefs or only social issues); Offers little or no analysis; Makes many factual errors; Includes many judgmental or argumentative statements.</p>","<p>Discusses question superficially or partially (only religious beliefs or only social issues); Offers little or no analysis; Makes many factual errors; Includes many judgmental or argumentative statements.</p>","<p>Discusses mainly either religious beliefs or social issues, with some analysis, perhaps limited or unbalanced; Includes some specific examples, generally accurate.</p>","<p>Discusses mainly either religious beliefs or social issues, with some analysis, perhaps limited or unbalanced; Includes some specific examples, generally accurate.</p>","<p>Discusses and analyzes Enlightenment thought on both religious beliefs and social issues, although discussion may be more thorough than analysis, and treatment of beliefs and issues may be unbalanced; Offers a number of examples, mainly accurate.</p>","<p>Discusses and analyzes Enlightenment thought on both religious beliefs and social issues, although discussion may be more thorough than analysis, and treatment of beliefs and issues may be unbalanced; Offers a number of examples, mainly accurate.</p>","<p>Fully responds to the question, with a sophisticated thesis, analysis, and conclusion, showing a clear awareness of change over time; Includes discussion and analysis of both Enlightenment religious beliefs and thought on social issues.</p>","<p>Fully responds to the question, with a sophisticated thesis, analysis, and conclusion, showing a clear awareness of change over time; Includes discussion and analysis of both Enlightenment religious beliefs and thought on social issues.</p>"]}]
