[{"id":"FT539907_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Overall","stimulusHtml":"<p>This question requires students to work with historical documents, describing their contents in an analytical framework.  A prime focus of analysis stipulated by the directions is for  students to “take into account both the sources and the authors’ points of view.” Because this was such a clearly stipulated area of analysis, some specific attention to it had to appear for a  student to achieve a score in the 7-9 range, although this  attention could be as minimal as citing the provenance of a document. For an essay to receive a score in the 10-12 range, the student had to make some mention of the <em>significance</em> of source/point of view, and for a paper to be elevated to the 13-15 category, this kind of analysis must have appeared frequently throughout the essay.</p><p>In addition, a central analytical approach was to group documents into areas of controversy. These areas involved such topics as religion, politics, cul- ture, ethnicity, economics, and nationalism. Students often simply categorized the controversy as pro- and anti-English union and incorporated the other issues into these two divisions. </p><p>Other indicators of analysis, as with all DBQs, include frequent reference to the terms of the question; juxtaposition of documents; recognition of complexities and contradictions in the documents; and the possible use of outside information to illuminate the documents. However, any outside information  (more often used in these essays than in most years, as the  question’s general topic is familiar to many students) must be used to enhance, not replace, analysis of the documents.</p><p></p><p><strong>13-15 points:</strong></p><p>Develops several controversies with sophistication, insight, and clear delineation;
