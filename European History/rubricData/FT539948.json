[{"id":"FT539948_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Overall","stimulusHtml":"<p>Key to this essay was the student’s control over how specific ideas of Italian Renaissance humanism differed from medieval thought concerning the role of the individual in society. This role was not restricted to politics; good essays could describe several of a broad range of social roles. Most essential was discussion of the humanists’ transformation of ideas. Students needed some awareness of Greco-Roman roots, the medieval hiatus in classical learning, and Renaissance recovery of the antique in order to score in the 4-5 range and higher. Consistent with the instructions, students were expected to use specific examples to support their answers.</p><p>Many students tended uncritically to interchange the terms “Renaissance” and “humanism,” and many included individuals who were not Italians, or who were not humanists, especially artists. Such references could support a good response, but in essays where they replaced attention to Italian humanists the resulting scores were limited to the 4-5 range at the highest.</p><p></p><p><strong>8-9 points:</strong></p><p>Fully develops several major contributions of Italian Renaissance <em>humanists</em> (not artists or other figures) to a new awareness of the individual’s role in society; Supports these points with specific, appropriate examples; Includes no major factual errors.</p><p><strong>6-7 points:</strong></p><p>Explains a transformation and application in society of new Renaissance concepts of individualism; Refers to some specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism (e.g., “secular,” “civic”) and individualism; May contain minor factual errors.</p><p><strong>4-5 points:</strong></p><p>Shows an understanding, perhaps imperfect, of a transformation and application in society of new concepts of individualism in the Italian Renaissance; May offer specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism; May contain major errors in chronology and source(s) of the ideas discussed.</p><p><strong>2-3 points:</strong></p><p>Exhibits a minimal understanding of Italian Renaissance<br>humanism; Fails to see distinctions between medieval and Renaissance humanist roles for the individual in society; Cites no specific Renaissance ideas; Contains major factual errors.</p><p><strong>1 point:</strong></p><p>Makes no attempt to deal with the question; Demonstrates little or no understanding of Renaissance humanism or of differences between medieval and Renaissance ideas about the individual’s role in society; Lacks specific ideas, chronology, supportive data.</p><p><strong>0 points:</strong></p><p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points","5 points","6 points","7 points","8 points","9 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"maxScores":[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9],"descriptions":["<p>Does not meet the criteria for earning 1 point or more.</p>","<p>Makes no attempt to deal with the question; Demonstrates little or no understanding of Renaissance humanism or of differences between medieval and Renaissance ideas about the individual’s role in society; Lacks specific ideas, chronology, supportive data.</p>","<p>Exhibits a minimal understanding of Italian Renaissance<br>humanism; Fails to see distinctions between medieval and Renaissance humanist roles for the individual in society; Cites no specific Renaissance ideas; Contains major factual errors.</p>","<p>Exhibits a minimal understanding of Italian Renaissance<br>humanism; Fails to see distinctions between medieval and Renaissance humanist roles for the individual in society; Cites no specific Renaissance ideas; Contains major factual errors.</p>","<p>Shows an understanding, perhaps imperfect, of a transformation and application in society of new concepts of individualism in the Italian Renaissance; May offer specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism; May contain major errors in chronology and source(s) of the ideas discussed.</p>","<p>Shows an understanding, perhaps imperfect, of a transformation and application in society of new concepts of individualism in the Italian Renaissance; May offer specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism; May contain major errors in chronology and source(s) of the ideas discussed.</p>","<p>Explains a transformation and application in society of new Renaissance concepts of individualism; Refers to some specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism (e.g., “secular,” “civic”) and individualism; May contain minor factual errors.</p>","<p>Explains a transformation and application in society of new Renaissance concepts of individualism; Refers to some specific examples of Italian Renaissance humanism (e.g., “secular,” “civic”) and individualism; May contain minor factual errors.</p>","<p>Fully develops several major contributions of Italian Renaissance <em>humanists</em> (not artists or other figures) to a new awareness of the individual’s role in society; Supports these points with specific, appropriate examples; Includes no major factual errors.</p>","<p>Fully develops several major contributions of Italian Renaissance <em>humanists</em> (not artists or other figures) to a new awareness of the individual’s role in society; Supports these points with specific, appropriate examples; Includes no major factual errors.</p>"]}]
