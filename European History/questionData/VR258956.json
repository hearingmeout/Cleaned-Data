In the hospital church there was a large icon representing the appearances of the Mother of God, painted on wood and without fittings. One of our elderly sisters had bought it with her own money and presented it to the church. The French took it from the wall and used it as a table. We were extremely upset to find that they had no respect for our churches, and our chaplain said to us: “How do you expect them to revere churches which have been turned into dwelling-places. If they sin through ignorance, God will forgive them, because they have not profaned any holy relics.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Document 5</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: Twelve princesses of the House of Hohenzollern, led by princess Marianne of Prussia, “Appeal to the Women of the Prussian State,” March 1813</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">We women, too, must participate, and must help promote victory.
