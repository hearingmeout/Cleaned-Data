The illustration uses two distinct representational styles for different parts of the body - the left half and the face, looking down at the fire, are portrayed realistically, while the right half of the body and the back of the head show only what appear to be nerves, the spinal column, and the brain. The right arm and leg appear only as outlines composed of networks and nerves, with no skin, muscles, or bones shown.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/4b9f28c86c3c6982d89a9dabf97cd806/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p><em>The illustration shows the physical response to a painful stimulus (ﬁre).
