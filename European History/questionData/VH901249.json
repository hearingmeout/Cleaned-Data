This might seem perfectly consistent with what we know about the Netherlands and England.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">But in most early modern European economies women faced a huge array of institutional constraints on their work and consumption choices. [For example], the southwest German territory of Württemberg differed from the Low Countries and England, but resembled many other parts of continental Europe, in the enduring powers of its guilds, communities, and local religious institutions. Württemberg retained occupational guilds until 1862, not just in traditional handicrafts, but also in export oriented proto-industries, shopkeeping, and merchant trading. Württemberg also had powerful local communities, whose courts, councils, officials, and citizens’ assemblies enabled them to monitor and regulate work, leisure, consumption, education, marriage, sexuality, and economic transactions. Württemberg established local church courts in the 1640s which remained active until c. 1890, had the power to impose fines and incarceration as well as religious penances, and closely regulated work, consumption, sociability, sexuality, poor relief, and cultural practices.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Sheilagh Ogilvie, historian, “Consumption, Social Capital, and the ‘Industrious Revolution’ in Early Modern Germany,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Journal of Economic History,</span> 2010</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The retention of occupational guild control over exports</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The power of local community institutions over social issues such as marriage</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The authority of church courts and citizen’s assemblies to regulate work and consumption</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The similarities between Württemberg and England and the Low Countries</p>"],"answer":2}]
