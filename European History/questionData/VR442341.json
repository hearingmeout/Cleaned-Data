[She acquires] the most detestable education, the grossest language, the basest manners. Woman goes there to cast off the principal qualities that distinguish her sex; there she contracts men’s habits, the allures of independence and liberty which later become the cause of disputes, of quarrels, and even of acts of violence. Earning a rather high wage, she becomes extravagant, and no longer knows the value of money. Habituated to going out every day, her house’s interior becomes a burden.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Dr. Jean-François Vleminckx, report to the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, 1870</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The growth of class consciousness within the proletariat and bourgeoisie</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The development of philanthropic organizations by the middle class</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The growth of the cult of domesticity and the increased focus among the bourgeoisie on the nuclear family</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The acceptance of the bourgeois ideal of companionate marriage by the working class</p>"],"answer":2}]
