[She acquires] the most detestable education, the grossest language, the basest manners. Woman goes there to cast off the principal qualities that distinguish her sex; there she contracts men’s habits, the allures of independence and liberty which later become the cause of disputes, of quarrels, and even of acts of violence. Earning a rather high wage, she becomes extravagant, and no longer knows the value of money. Habituated to going out every day, her house’s interior becomes a burden.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Dr. Jean-François Vleminckx, report to the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, 1870</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Extending the right to vote to the working class and to women</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Passing laws restricting the labor of women and children in mines and factories</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Adopting more laissez-faire economic policies</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Implementing compulsory public education programs</p>"],"answer":1}]
