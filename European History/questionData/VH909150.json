In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, international trade and an increasing demand for consumer ‘worldly goods’ on the part of the wealthy triggered the European Renaissance in art and learning. The intellectual advances of the scientific revolution took place in the context of the broadened horizons of that consumer revolution. Emerging seventeenth-century science matched and furthered the globalizing interests that the Renaissance had stimulated. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In a number of ways the process of transmission of the new science was part and parcel of a general explosion in written and printed communication of the same period. That process influenced the very nature of science and determined some of the future directions of its development.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Lisa Jardine, historian,<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution</span>, 1999</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The new ideas in astronomy and anatomy that led intellectuals to challenge the authority of ancient and classical sources of knowledge</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The development of new methods of scholarship based on reinterpretation of classical texts</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The willingness of Protestant reformers to challenge the scholarly and intellectual authority of the Catholic Church</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The development and spread of vernacular literacy as a result of Gutenberg’s development of the printing press</p>"],"answer":0}]
