The amount of patient thought, of repeated experiment, of happy exertion of genius, by which our manufactures have been created and carried to their present excellence, is scarcely to be imagined. If we look around the rooms we inhabit, or through those storehouses of every convenience, of every luxury that man can desire, which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities, we shall find in the history of each article, of every fabric, a series of failures which have gradually led the way to excellence; and we shall notice, in the art of making even the most insignificant of them, processes calculated to excite our admiration by their simplicity, or to rivet our attention by their unlooked-for results.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Charles Babbage, English mathematician and inventor, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</span>, 1832</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The abundance of raw materials for manufactured products in Great Britain</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Britain’s leadership in the process of industrialization</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The development and increasing influence of Marxist thought</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The continued influence of the Enlightenment’s mechanistic view of the world on nineteenth-century writers</p>"],"answer":1}]
