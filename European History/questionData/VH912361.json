If, on the contrary, charity originates in taxes which take from one to give to others, this bond is no longer forged. In fact, the result will be bad feelings on both sides: [the rich] will be fed up, tired with, overwhelmed by taxes; [the poor] will no longer see the hand that gives, they will be led to believe that the resources of the state are unlimited, they will become more demanding, and will grow to hate a society which does not give enough. From there to social disorder, it’s not very far.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">M.

It is to live by the work of his profession, to raise his family honestly, to give to our beloved France soldiers robust in body and spirit, and mothers who possess the moral energy to raise their children. It is greed that grows in society and perhaps humanity; all society should be based on the three grand words of human thought, Duty, Justice, and Reason. For us the cost of labor must be raised to where the worker has a proportional part of the boss’s profits because they contribute to the wealth of the latter.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Testimony of members of a French weavers’ union before a French government committee, 1904</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot wants the state to intervene on behalf of increasing workers’ wages, whereas the weavers do not want the state to intervene.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot does not want the state to intervene on behalf of increasing workers’ wages, whereas the weavers do want the state to intervene.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot and the weavers both want the state to intervene to increase workers’ wages.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neither Raudot nor the weavers want the state to intervene to increase workers’ wages.</p>"],"answer":1}]
