In order to gather this information...I pretended to be a heretic myself and proposed to take some books, such as the works of John Calvin and Theodore Beza, to Spain....A bookseller and a merchant volunteered to bring the books secretly to Barcelona to the home of one of their friends who was, as they said, of their faith. A thousand deceptions were necessary to gather this information....I learned the names of all [Protestants] from the merchant, for he told me that they were of his religion. I am staying here...in the service of God and Your Majesty.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Report by an agent of the Spanish Inquisition to King Philip II, 1566</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>The Battle of Lepanto against the Ottoman Empire (1571)</p>","<p>The outcome of the Thirty Years’ War (1648)</p>","<p>The Siege of Vienna (1683)</p>","<p>The outcome of the Seven Years’ War (1763)</p>"],"answer":0}]
