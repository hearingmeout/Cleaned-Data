And many of the hip-hop people from New York City were deployed here as well. Additionally, there was a large club scene, where groups from the United States performed. For example, in the early 1980s our crew called Universal Movements breakdanced with the Rock Steady Crew at the Frankfurt air base. . . . In 1983 the Funkadelic opened in Frankfurt. As far as I know, it was the first club in Germany which promoted Black music that was almost totally hip-hop orientated. This club would never have survived without a US-American crowd. In this way the whole thing developed and grew larger.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Cutmaster GB, German hip-hop DJ, discussing events in Frankfurt in the 1980s, interview conducted in 2002</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Imports of American culture in some cases generated enthusiasm, particularly among younger people and cultural minorities.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">American and NATO military presence in West Germany during the Cold War generated resistance from the local population.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Immigration by guest workers into West Germany generated a significant shift in German culture.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Popular culture and consumerism were significant factors in undermining the communist governments in Eastern Europe.</p>"],"answer":0}]
