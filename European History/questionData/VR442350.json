We are prevented, in violation of the old customs, from gathering wood in the county’s forest.

Our lords do their hawking and hunting on our fields without showing consideration for the condition of our crops. We till our fields and meadows with great effort to fulfill our obligations to our lords and to nourish our wives and children. In return our lords and bailiffs ought to guard us and our property and protect us from harm. Instead, they ride and trample over our meadows and fields. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">23. Although we have for many years made annual payments of interest, dues, and rents to our lords, we confess that we do not know the origins of these payments, nor do we know for what reason we are obliged to make them, nor what obligations our lords owe us in return. . . .
