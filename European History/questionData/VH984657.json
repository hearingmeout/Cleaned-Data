The German people never had the meaning and implications of it explained to them. Thus we call for the founding of a non-partisan and ideologically neutral league for the purpose of finding a fair possible solution to the problem—in dialogue with politicians—of determining the fate not only of the foreign workers but of our country. What makes it so difficult to find a solution to this problem is the fact that we can no longer have public discussion without people who raise these issues being called ‘Nazis.’ We plead, therefore, for a calm discussion and to find a solution, on the basis of the Basic Law [the constitution]—against ideological nationalism, racism, and extremism of both Left and Right.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">It is not possible to integrate huge masses of non-German foreigners into our people, without endangering our language, culture, and religion.
