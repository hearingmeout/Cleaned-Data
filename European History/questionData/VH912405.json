If, on the contrary, charity originates in taxes which take from one to give to others, this bond is no longer forged. In fact, the result will be bad feelings on both sides: [the rich] will be fed up, tired with, overwhelmed by taxes; [the poor] will no longer see the hand that gives, they will be led to believe that the resources of the state are unlimited, they will become more demanding, and will grow to hate a society which does not give enough. From there to social disorder, it’s not very far.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">M.

It is to live by the work of his profession, to raise his family honestly, to give to our beloved France soldiers robust in body and spirit, and mothers who possess the moral energy to raise their children. It is greed that grows in society and perhaps humanity; all society should be based on the three grand words of human thought, Duty, Justice, and Reason. For us the cost of labor must be raised to where the worker has a proportional part of the boss’s profits because they contribute to the wealth of the latter.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Testimony of members of a French weavers’ union before a French government committee, 1904</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot sees state intervention as leading to rebellion by ungrateful workers, while the weavers see state intervention as aiding France.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot sees reliance on charity from the wealthy as insufficient to meet the needs of the workers, leading to social disorder, and the weavers share this view.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot sees reliance on charity from the wealthy as sufficient to meet the needs of the workers, preventing social disorder, and the weavers share this view.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Raudot sees state intervention as preventing rebellion by ungrateful workers, while the weavers see state intervention as undermining French national unity.</p>"],"answer":0}]
