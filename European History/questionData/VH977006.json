He enumerated the ships we have and the ones we would need in order to survive a war; . . . emphasized that we had to have an armored fleet to protect our trade and to keep ourselves supplied with provisions; and was of the opinion that our fleet would have to be strong enough to prevent the French fleet from cutting off the food supplies we needed. In addition, he . . . would have to find the means, and if the Reichstag did not approve this, he would nevertheless carry on building and present the Reichstag with the bill later. Public opinion didn’t concern him. He knew that the people didn’t love him, and cursed him; but that wouldn’t deter him. I then reminded the Emperor of the difference between Prussia and the [German] Empire . . . In the Empire the Emperor only had the rights which the Reichstag conceded to him.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Account of a conversation between German chancellor Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst and Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1897, published in the chancellor’s memoirs, 1931</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bismarck, who had engineered the unification of various states into the German Empire, followed a populist approach.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bismarck, who was a member of the Prussian aristocracy, sought to preserve the privileges of his class by avoiding political controversy.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bismarck, who was most concerned with avoiding war against a stronger coalition of European powers, sought to isolate France diplomatically.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bismarck, who had served in the Prussian Army before entering politics, tended to deemphasize the importance of the navy.</p>"],"answer":0}]
