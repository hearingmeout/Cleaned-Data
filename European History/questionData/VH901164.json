For where there is less intellect and less dedication, there is less sin; and Eve lacked these qualities and therefore sinned less. Adam must also be judged more guilty then Eve because of his greater contempt for God’s command. For in Genesis 2 it appears that the Lord commanded Adam, not Eve.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">When God created man, from the beginning he created him perfect, and the powers of his soul perfect, and gave him a greater understanding and knowledge of truth as well as a greater depth of wisdom. . . . Therefore, it appears that Adam’s sin was greater than Eve’s. . . . Adam either had free will or he did not. If he did not have free will, he did not sin; if he had free will, then you claim Eve forced the sin upon him, which is impossible. . . . Thus, Adam appeared to accuse God rather than excuse himself when he said: ‘The woman you placed at my side gave me fruit from the tree and I ate it.’</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Let these words be enough from me, an unarmed and poor little woman.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Isotta Nogarola, Italian scholar, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">On the Equal or Unequal Sin of Eve and Adam</span>, text written in the form of a debate between the author and Ludovico Foscarini, a Venetian statesman, Italy, 1451</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The political fragmentation of the Italian Peninsula</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emphasis on secular study of Greek and Roman texts</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The creation of new approaches to the study of religious texts</p>","The development of vernacular (common or local) literature"],"answer":2}]
