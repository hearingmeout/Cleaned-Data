Since that time, however, the Eastern emphasis on heavy machinery and production goods has brought about a changed situation. It is particularly appropriate at this time, therefore, to show West Berliners, and more especially East Zone and [Soviet] Sector visitors, the progress made in the West in developing consumer goods designed to raise the standard of living of the average family.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">United States Department of State memo regarding the Berlin industrial fair, November 1952</p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Source 2</span></p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">“For the first time in modern British history the working-class home, as well as the middle-class home, has become a place that is warm, comfortable, and able to provide its own fireside entertainment—in fact, pleasant to live in.
