This is the business of Europeans. The initiative, I think, must come from Europe. The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">George Marshall, United States Secretary of State, speech at Harvard University, 1947</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The recognition that the Great Depression’s effects had empowered the rise of Nazi Germany</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The concern that the addition of women to new roles in the workforce had caused economic and social disruption</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The fear that new technologies developed during the war, such as nuclear power, would cause economic dislocations in traditional industries</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States opposition to the growth of welfare-state programs in Western Europe after the war</p>"],"answer":0}]
