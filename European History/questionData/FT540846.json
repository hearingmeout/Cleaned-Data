Ferguson, a Scotchman, an excellent geometrician, entered into his service, and was the first person who brought arithmetic into use in the exchequer in Russia, where before that time, they made use only of the Tartarian method of reckoning, with balls strung upon a wire [an abacus]....He took with him two young students from a mathematical school, and this was the beginning of the marine academy.... Peter made himself proficient in astronomy, [and] he perfectly well understood the motions of the heavenly bodies, as well as the laws of gravitation, by which they are directed. This force, now so evidently demonstrated, and before the time of the great Newton so little known, by which all the planets gravitate towards each other, and which retain them in their orbits, had already become familiar to a sovereign of Russia, while other countries amused themselves with imaginary theories, and, in Galileo’s nation, one set of ignorant persons ordered others, as ignorant, to believe the earth to be immovable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Voltaire, <em>History of the Russian Empire Under Peter the Great</em>, 1759, discussing Tsar Peter I’s Grand Embassy, which traveled to western Europeat the end of the seventeenth century</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>The persistence of folk stories and oral traditions</p>","<p>The reliance of Renaissance thinkers on classical Greek and Roman texts</p>","<p>The Enlightenment belief in the rational order of the universe</p>","<p>The efforts of religious and secular authorities to suppress scientific development</p>"],"answer":2}]
