Admittedly, the atmosphere of the [1930s] had something to do with my choice of subject as well as with my methods of treatment. Many of my generation who grew up under the shadow of the First World War had a sincere, if mistaken, conviction that all wars were unnecessary and useless. I no longer think that all wars are unnecessary; but some are, and I still think that the Thirty Years War was one of these.
