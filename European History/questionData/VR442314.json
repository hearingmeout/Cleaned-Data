This grave dissociation of past and present is the most important fact of our time and the cause of the confusion characteristic of our present-day existence. We feel that we have suddenly been left alone on Earth; that the dead did not just die in appearance only, but in actual point of fact; that they can no longer help us. . . . Models, norms, standards are of no use to us. We have to solve our problems without any active collaboration with the past, ‘from scratch,’ be they problems of art, science, or politics. The European stands alone, without any living ghosts by his side.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">José Ortega y Gasset, Spanish philosopher, essay on art criticism, 1925</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the Latin American wars of independence</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the devastation of the First World War</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the rise of fascism in Italy</p>"],"answer":0}]
