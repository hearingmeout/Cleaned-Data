In addition to the years, the following 5 events are also indicated on the horizontal axis: Beginning of the Protestant Reformation in 1517; Beginning of the Council of Trent in 1545; End of the Council of Trent in 1563; Beginning of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618; and End of the Thirty Years’ War in 1648. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of Persons,” and the numbers 0 through 6,000, in increments of 1,000, are indicated. The data represented by the two curves are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. In 1450, the curve representing the accused begins at 200 people, and the curve representing the executed begins at 100 people. The numbers of people accused and executed remain relatively steady until the year 1550. At this point, both curves begin increasing at the same rate until the curve representing the accused reaches a peak of approximately 5800 people, and the curve representing the executed reaches a peak of approximately 2300 people around the beginning of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618. At this point, both curves begin decreasing at the same rate until the curve representing the accused ends at 800 people and the curve representing the executed ends at 200 in the year 1700.\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH900644.g03.png\" width=\"455\" /><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Source: Adapted from: Peter Leeson and Jacob Russ, “Witch Trials,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Economic Journal,</span> Volume 128 (August 2017), p. 2081.</span></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The likelihood of those accused of witchcraft being executed remained approximately the same throughout the period.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The likelihood of those accused of witchcraft being executed increased significantly after 1600.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The likelihood of those accused of witchcraft being executed was higher in periods where the number of accusations was increasing.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The likelihood of those accused of witchcraft being executed was significantly lower after the end of the Thirty Years’ War.</p>"],"answer":0}]
