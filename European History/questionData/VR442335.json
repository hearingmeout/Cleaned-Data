Then our constitution, after many fluctuations, and frequent struggles for power by different members of it (several of them attended with vast effusions of blood), was finally settled. A revolution so remarkable, and attended with such happy consequences, had perhaps no parallel in the history of the world, till the still more remarkable revolutions that have taken place lately in America and France. [The revolution under King William], as Mr. Hume says, cut off all pretensions to power founded on hereditary right; when a prince was chosen who received the crown on express conditions, and found his authority established on the same foundation with the privileges of the people.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Joseph Priestley, English natural scientist and liberal political theorist, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Lectures on History and General Policy</span>, 1790s</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The removal of James II by parliament and Dutch intervention in 1688</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The split with the Roman Catholic Church to create the Church of England</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The execution of Charles I by parliament during the English Civil War</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Acts of Union between England and Scotland creating the United Kingdom in 1707</p>"],"answer":0}]
