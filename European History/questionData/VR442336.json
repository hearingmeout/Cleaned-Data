[The revolution under King William], as Mr. Hume says, cut off all pretensions to power founded on hereditary right; when a prince was chosen who received the crown on express conditions, and found his authority established on the same foundation with the privileges of the people.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Joseph Priestley, English natural scientist and liberal political theorist, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Lectures on History and General Policy</span>, 1790s</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The formulation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The creation of a meritocracy in the government and military</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The fixing of prices and wages to combat inflation</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The institution of the Reign of Terror</p>"],"answer":3}]
