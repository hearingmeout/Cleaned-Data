In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, international trade and an increasing demand for consumer ‘worldly goods’ on the part of the wealthy triggered the European Renaissance in art and learning. The intellectual advances of the scientific revolution took place in the context of the broadened horizons of that consumer revolution. Emerging seventeenth-century science matched and furthered the globalizing interests that the Renaissance had stimulated. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In a number of ways the process of transmission of the new science was part and parcel of a general explosion in written and printed communication of the same period.
