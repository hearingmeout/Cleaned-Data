Yet...decades of work on early modern European [economic history] have fundamentally challenged the conventional belief in a growthless, traditional economy. It is now sometimes conceded that substantial economic growth occurred before the technological breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution....[Moreover, new data] on overall British economic performance during the classical Industrial Revolution era, 1760–1830, reduces [previous historians’] growth estimates by more than half. This slower macroeconomic growth bathes in a rather less luminous light the traditional arguments about the relative importance of technology in initiating modern economic growth in this era. It also reduces the contrast with earlier decades and thus makes pre-industrial Britain as well as several neighboring countries richer, more [developed] societies than has long been supposed.”</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 520px;\">Jan de Vries, historian of early modern Europe, <em>The Industrious Revolution</em>, 2008</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>Early modern Western Europe had a unique “European marriage pattern” of high age at first marriage and high rates of celibacy.</p>","<p>Before the middle of the eighteenth century, the European population was subject to Malthusian crises.</p>","<p>The expansion of overseas trade was crucial to Europe’s economic growth in the early modern period.</p>","Countries’ mobilization for warfare was key to economic development in early modern Europe."],"answer":0}]
