Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture and, you know, the British character has done so much for democracy and law, and has done so much throughout the world, that if there is any fear that it might be swamped, people are going to be really rather hostile to those coming in. So, if you want good race relations, you have got to allay peoples’ fears on numbers. . . . because at the moment it is about between 45,000 and 50,000 people coming in a year. Now, I was brought up in a small town, 25,000.
