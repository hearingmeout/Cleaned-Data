There a certain formula of association was proposed, whose purpose was to break the last edict of pacification and to place the king at war against those of the so-called Protestant religion. . . . I remarked that it seemed to me that the king ought not to be counseled to go to war, because of the recent injuries the kingdom has suffered, and that anyone who favors civil war is ungodly and deserves our prayer. . . . Concerning the present formula of association, I say that I cannot sign it and call myself a servant of the king. I know that war is unjust if it is not conducted and undertaken by the king in his faithful and holy council.”</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Pierre de Blanchefort, French nobleman, diary entry, 1576</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
