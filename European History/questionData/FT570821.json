The danger is that of a new religion. The church knows that it will have to account before God if the German people, unwarned, should turn away from Christ.</p>\n\n<p>The first commandment reads: I am the Lord Thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. The new religion is a rebellion against the first commandment:</p>\n\n<p>• In it, the racial and folkish ideology becomes a myth. In it, blood and race, nationality, national honor, and the nation’s freedom of action become idols.</p>\n\n<p>• The faith in an ‘eternal Germany’ demanded by this religion replaces the faith in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>• This false faith creates its gods in man’s image and essence. Such idolatry has nothing in common with positive Christianity. It is the expression of the Anti-Christ....</p>\n\n<p>• The church must not bow to the new religion’s claim that the state can bind the individual’s conscience.... [Jesus Christ] alone can bind and loosen a man’s conscience.</p>\n\n<p>• Therefore the church must not allow itself to be pushed from the public sphere into some quiet corner of private piety, where, self-satisfied, it would betray its mission.”</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 480px;\">Declaration of a group of German Protestant pastors, Berlin, 1935</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>Attempts by Christian churches to formulate responses to the pressing political issues of the period</p>","<p>An emphasis on social work and helping those in need in the works of church leaders and theologians</p>","<p>Christian leaders’ adherence to conservative positions on matters related to gender roles and family life</p>","<p>Debates over Christian churches’ role in the social and political life of an increasingly multicultural Europe</p>"],"answer":-1}]
