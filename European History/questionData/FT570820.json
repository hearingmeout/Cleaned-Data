In it, blood and race, nationality, national honor, and the nation’s freedom of action become idols.</p>\n\n<p>• The faith in an ‘eternal Germany’ demanded by this religion replaces the faith in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>• This false faith creates its gods in man’s image and essence. Such idolatry has nothing in common with positive Christianity. It is the expression of the Anti-Christ....</p>\n\n<p>• The church must not bow to the new religion’s claim that the state can bind the individual’s conscience....
