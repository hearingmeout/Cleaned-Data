In this view, Hitler is seen as the driving force of Nazi anti-Semitic policy, whose views indicate a coherent line of thought from a very early point. Hitler is also seen as the sole strategist with the authority and the determination to begin the implementation of the Final Solution. . . . This line of thought accents the role of Hitler in initiating the murder of European Jewry, seeing a high degree of persistence, consistency, and orderly sequence in Nazi anti-Jewish policy, directed from a very early point to the goal of mass murder.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Michael Marrus, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Holocaust in History</span>, 1989</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">“War and the annihilation of the Jews were interdependent.
