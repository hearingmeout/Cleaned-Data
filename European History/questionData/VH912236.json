The amount of patient thought, of repeated experiment, of happy exertion of genius, by which our manufactures have been created and carried to their present excellence, is scarcely to be imagined. If we look around the rooms we inhabit, or through those storehouses of every convenience, of every luxury that man can desire, which deck the crowded streets of our larger cities, we shall find in the history of each article, of every fabric, a series of failures which have gradually led the way to excellence; and we shall notice, in the art of making even the most insignificant of them, processes calculated to excite our admiration by their simplicity, or to rivet our attention by their unlooked-for results.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Charles Babbage, English mathematician and inventor, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</span>, 1832</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The private initiative of industrialists and manufacturers that developed Britain’s industrial economy</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increasing availability of overseas goods as a result of the expansion of the British Empire</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The growth of British industrial cities over the course of the nineteenth century</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The failure of British industry to keep pace with Germany during the second industrial revolution</p>"],"answer":0}]
