This grave dissociation of past and present is the most important fact of our time and the cause of the confusion characteristic of our present-day existence. We feel that we have suddenly been left alone on Earth; that the dead did not just die in appearance only, but in actual point of fact; that they can no longer help us. . . . Models, norms, standards are of no use to us. We have to solve our problems without any active collaboration with the past, ‘from scratch,’ be they problems of art, science, or politics. The European stands alone, without any living ghosts by his side.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">José Ortega y Gasset, Spanish philosopher, essay on art criticism, 1925</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The continued popularity of astrology and the occult among both the elite and the nonelite segments of the population</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The discoveries of physicists such as Albert Einstein, Ernest Rutherford, and Niels Bohr, which provided a new framework for the understanding of the cosmos and the atom</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emergence of right-wing authoritarian regimes in Spain and Portugal, supported by traditional elites and the Catholic Church</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The widespread disillusionment with European values associated with the Lost Generation</p>"],"answer":2}]
