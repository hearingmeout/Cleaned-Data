Even supposing the war is undertaken for pious reasons rather than for gain, I confess that I cannot promise what you ask, but rather the opposite . . . It is foolish to wage wars in foreign lands, while at home we are losing spiritual battles . . . Now that the Roman Curia is more tyrannical than any Turk . . . there is no hope of successful war or victory. As far as I can see, God fights against us; first, we must conquer him with tears, pure prayers, holy and pure faith.”</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Martin Luther, letter to the chaplain of an elector of the German states, 1518</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
