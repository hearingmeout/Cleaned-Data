In these countries they are allowed to inherit estates, succeeding not only to dukedoms but to principalities exactly like men do. Not only to principalities but to the monarchy itself, like the sister of the King of Spain, who was able to ascend to the monarchy, as well as have dominion over numerous other principalities. Women who inherit estates can be seen every day in France and England; the Germans, too, recognize women’s superiority. The women there conduct all the business dealings and mercantile transactions in the cities while the men remain at the stoves. This also occurs in Flanders and in France. In France men may not spend even a centime unless at the request of their wives, and women not only administrate business dealings and sales but private income as well.”</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Lucrezia Marinella, Venetian author from a wealthy family, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men</span>, 1600</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
