Nineteen out of twenty of these productions are in favor of liberty, and commonly violent against the clergy and nobility;... but enquiring for such as had appeared on the other side of the question, to my astonishment I find that there are but two or three that have merit enough to be known. Is it not [surprising], that while the press teems with the most leveling and seditious principles, that if put in execution would overturn the monarchy, nothing in reply appears, and not the least step is taken by the court to restrain these publications?”</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 440px;\">Arthur Young, English writer, account of travels in France, published 1792</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>French physiocrats’ critique of mercantilism</p>","<p>Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em></p>","<p>Discussions in French salons and coffeehouses</p>","<p>The paintings of Jacques-Louis David</p>"],"answer":1}]
