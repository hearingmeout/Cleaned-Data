These Christians have dwellings on the island and factories where they buy and sell with the said Arabs who come to the coast to trade for merchandise of various kinds, such as woolen cloths, cotton, silver and coarse cloth, that is cloaks, carpets, and similar articles and above all grain, for they are always short of food. The Arabs give in exchange slaves whom the Arabs bring from the land of the Blacks, and gold dust. The King therefore caused a castle to be built on the island to protect this trade forever. For this reason, Portuguese caravels come and go all year long to this island.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Alvise de Ca’da Mosto, Venetian merchant, describing the Portuguese island of Arguim off the west coast of Africa, 1454</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>developing their internal industries</p>","<p>shifting their focus to trading in the Mediterranean</p>","<p>increasing overland trade with the Ottoman Empire</p>","<p>developing rival colonies and overseas trading networks</p>"],"answer":2}]
