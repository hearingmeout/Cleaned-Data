The horizontal axis is labeled Particle Diameter, in micrometers, and the numbers 0 through 3.0, in increments of 0.5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Efficiency, in percentage, and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. A key shows that data can be represented for eight categories of flow rates: 450 liters per minute, 300 liters per minute, 200 liters per minute, 100 liters per minute, with either dry or wet scrubbers. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Data for wet, 450 liters per minute flow rate: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 11 percent efficiency, and moves upwards and to the right to the point 0.6 particle diameter comma 33 percent efficiency, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right to the point 1.1 particle diameter comma 84 percent efficiency. The line then moves gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.5 particle diameter comma 100 percent efficiency. Data for wet, 300 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 9 percent efficiency, and moves upwards and to the right to the point 0.6 particle diameter comma 19 percent efficiency, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right to the point 1.1 particle diameter comma 79 percent efficiency. The line then moves gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.5 particle diameter comma 100 percent efficiency. Data for wet, 200 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 9 percent efficiency, and moves upwards and to the right to the point 0.6 particle diameter comma 15 percent efficiency, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right to the point 1.2 particle diameter comma 69 percent efficiency. The line then moves gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.5 particle diameter comma 100 percent. Data for wet, 100 liters per minute: the line begins at 0.25 particle diameter comma 1 percent efficiency and moves upwards and to the right to the point 0.7 particle diameter comma 10 percent efficiency, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right to the point 1.3 particle diameter comma 50 percent efficiency. The line then moves gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.5 particle diameter comma 95 percent efficiency. Data for dry, 450 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 3 percent efficiency and trends upwards and to the right to the point 1.3 particle diameter comma 8 percent efficiency, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.6 particle diameter comma 39 percent efficiency. Data for dry, 300 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 3 percent efficiency and trends gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.6 particle diameter comma 10 percent efficiency. Data for dry, 200 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 3 percent efficiency and trends slightly upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.6 particle diameter comma 5 percent efficiency. Data for dry, 100 liters per minute: the line begins at the point 0.25 particle diameter comma 3 percent efficiency and trends slightly upwards and to the right, ending at the point 2.6 particle diameter comma 2 percent efficiency.\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH976232.g02.png\" width=\"550\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dry scrubbers using a flow rate of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"200 liters per minute\"><math alttext=\"200 liters per minute\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>200</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mfrac><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>min</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are best suited to remove small particles.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Dry scrubbers using a flow rate of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"450 liters per minute\"><math alttext=\"450 liters per minute\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>450</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mfrac><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>min</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are best suited to remove large particles.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wet scrubbers using a flow rate of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"300 liters per minute\"><math alttext=\"300 liters per minute\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>300</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mfrac><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>min</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are best suited to remove small particles.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wet scrubbers using a flow rate of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"450 liters per minute\"><math alttext=\"450 liters per minute\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>450</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mfrac><mrow><mtext>L</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>min</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are best suited to remove large particles.</p>"],"answer":3}]
