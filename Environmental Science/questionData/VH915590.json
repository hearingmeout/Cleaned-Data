There are four objects labeled with the letters A through D on the diagram, which are listed as follows. A, Vegetation. B, Sedimentary rock. C, Ocean. D, Burning of fossil fuels. In the diagram, there is land, water, the atmosphere, and rock. On land, arrows point from a cow (labeled Respiration), dead animal matter (labeled Decay), a factory using coal, oil and gas (labeled Burning of fossil fuels, which is letter D) to the atmosphere. An arrow labeled Photosynthesis points from the atmosphere to vegetation on land (which is letter A). On land, an arrow points from vegetation to soil and organic matter. A pair of arrows, labeled Carbon dioxide exchange, points between the atmosphere and the ocean (which is letter C). In the ocean, an arrow labeled Sinking sediment points from Phytoplankton to the ocean floor. On land, rivers connect to the ocean and carry carbon compounds released from weathering and runoff. Beneath the land and ocean floor, Sedimentary rock (which is letter B) and rock formation are indicated.\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH915575.g03.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"shared_choices\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the boxes represents a carbon source?</p>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VH915590_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":3}]
