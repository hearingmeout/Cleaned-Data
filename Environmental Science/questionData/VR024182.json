The original habitat shows 4 irregular polygons arranged roughly in two rows and two columns. Scenario 1 shows 4 irregular polygons in the same arrangement as the original habitat, and each polygon is the same shape as, but smaller than, its corresponding polygon in the original habitat. Scenario 2 shows 2 irregular polygons that are identical to the polygons in the upper left and lower right of the original habitat, but the polygons in the upper right and lower left of the original habitat are missing from scenario 2. Scenario 3 shows what looks like the same polygons in the same arrangement from the original habitat, but each polygon is bisected by a narrow strip cut through its central region.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR024154.g04.png\" width=\"295\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Native species were replanted in the areas, which led to fewer niches.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Roads and electric power lines subdivided the landscape into smaller pieces and decreased the amount of available habitat.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increased edge-to-interior ratio resulted in habitat fragmentation and the formation of smaller, more manageable parcels of land.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Habitat corridors were built to allow individuals between populations to mate, which helped to prevent inbreeding and reduce the genetic diversity often found in isolated populations.</p>"],"answer":1}]
