The parking lot is slightly sloped so the rainwater flows toward the gardens. The runoff from the roof is collected by various downspouts and directed toward the gardens. Scientists at the agency plan to monitor the effectiveness by measuring the water quality of the storm water as it moves through the gardens during and after storm events.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Water samples collected from a faucet inside the building</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Water samples collected from the roof or parking lot before they passed through the gardens</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Soil samples collected from different rain gardens on the property</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Soil samples collected from under the parking lots around the city</p>"],"answer":1}]
