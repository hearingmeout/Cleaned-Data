The vertical axis is labeled Relative Solar Energy. The two curves are labeled location 1 and location 2. The curve for location 1 fluctuates slightly across the upper range of the graph. The curve reaches its highest points in March and September and reaches its lowest point in June, and its start and end points in January and December are both approximately halfway between its highest and lowest points. The curve for location 2 starts in January at approximately one quarter of the way up the vertical axis, rises to a high point in June that is slightly above the location 1 low point in that month, and then descends to end in December at approximately the same height at which the curve started.\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR020770.g09.png\" width=\"380\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both locations are at the same latitude.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Location 1 is close to the equator, and Location 2 is in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Location 1 is in the Northern Hemisphere, and Location 2 is in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Location 1 is in the Southern Hemisphere, and Location 2 is close to the equator.</p>"],"answer":1}]
