Birds with smaller beaks are better suited for grasses and soft seeds, while birds with larger beaks are better suited for seeds and nuts. In years with less rainfall, there are fewer grasses to feed on and the finches rely more on seeds for food. In 1977, 1980, and 1982, there were droughts, and the area experienced significantly less rainfall than average.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot titled “Average Beak Size in Finch Population.” The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1976 through 1984, in increments of 2, are indicated.
