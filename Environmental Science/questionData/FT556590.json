On the x-axis is the year from 1976 to 1995 in increments of 1 year, with vertical reference lines drawn at each year. On the left y-axis is ozone in parts per million from 0 to 0.16 in increments of 0.02, with horizontal reference lines drawn at each 0.02. The right y-axis is carbon monoxide with the same scale as the left axis. A dotted line is plotted to show carbon monoxide. It starts at about 0.15 in 1976 and steadily decreases to about 0.06 in 1995. A solid line is plotted to show ozone. It also starts at about 0.15 in 1976 but remains nearly constant until 1995, with small fluctuations that take it up to 0.16 and down to 0.12. \" height=\"420\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/a56de9affd565a471d720370d8a8ce62/original.png\" width=\"555\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A graph is shown with the title Atmospheric Concentrations of Lead and Particulate matter.
