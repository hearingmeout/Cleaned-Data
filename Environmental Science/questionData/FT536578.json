On the x-axis is the year in two year increments from 1958 to 1992, with a vertical reference line drawn at every year. On the y-axis is the C O 2 concentration in parts per million from 315 to 360 in increments of 5 with horizontal reference lines drawn at every increment of 5. In each year, the curve increases a small amount, decreases to below where it began, and returns to about where it started at the end of the year. This cycle has an amplitude of about 5 parts per million and is repeated every year, making the whole graph look like a zig-zag. The general trend of the entire graph is that it increases steadily from 1958 to 1992, with the yearly cycle in 1958 beginning at 315 parts per million and the yearly cycle in 1991 beginning just about 355 parts per million. \" height=\"386\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d257d8f4515f2c6d5724128fab0d8842/original.png\" width=\"615\">"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>5 ppm</p>","<p>30 ppm</p>","<p>50 ppm</p>","<p>340 ppm</p>","<p>355 ppm</p>"],"answer":0}]
