Survivorship declined later in life.

Survivorship curve type I extends almost horizontally to the right of the vertical axis and then slopes downward, slightly at first and then more steeply, until it ends at the end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type II extends in a straight line that slants downward and to the right from the top of the vertical axis to the end of the horizontal axis.
