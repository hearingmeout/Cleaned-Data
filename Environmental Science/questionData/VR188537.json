The vertical axis is labeled “Annual Erosion, in tons per acre,” and the numbers 0 through 30, in increments, of 5, are indicated. A key indicates the type of agricultural practice represented by each curve. One curve represents tillage, one curve represents no-till, one curve represents no-till and cover crop, and one curve represents crop rotation. A dashed horizontal line labeled “T equals tolerable loss,” begins at 4 on the vertical axis and extends through the graph. The behavior of each curve is as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The curve representing tillage begins at 1 on the vertical axis, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 1% and 4 tons per acre, and continues upward until it reaches 4.5% and 12 tons per acre. It then moves more steeply upward until it reaches a slope of 7% and 30 tons per acre. The curve representing no-till begins just above 0 on the vertical axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 7% and 4 tons per acre. It continues gradually upward and to the right, reaching 10 tons per acre at a slope of 12.5%, 20 tons per acre at a slope of 20%, and ending at 30 tons per acre at a slope of 26%. The curve representing no-till and cover crop begins just above 0 on the vertical axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 11% and 4 tons per acre. It continues gradually upward and to the right, reaching 10 tons per acre at a slope of 19%, and ending at 20.5 tons per acre at a slope of 30%. The curve representing crop rotation begins just above 0 on the vertical axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right. It reaches the tolerable loss line at the point representing a slope of 20% and 4 tons per acre. It continues gradually upward and to the right until it ends at 9 tons per acre at a slope of 30%.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR188537.g02.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Soil erosion is one of the most serious soil-degrading processes. Each year tons of soil erode from cropland, pastures, forests, and other places. The amount of erosion varies dramatically among various land-use types.
