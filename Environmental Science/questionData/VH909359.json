But if they survived, the young dinosaurs were able to grow at a rapid pace and disperse into the environment in order to thrive. Based on this information and the graph above, which of the following best characterizes this species of dinosaur?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH909359_rubric","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The graph below shows three different survivorship curves.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of three different survivorship curves in a single coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “Time.” The vertical axis is labeled “Percentage of Organisms Surviving.” The numbers 1, 10, and 100 are indicated from bottom to top along the vertical axis, with 10 halfway between 1 and 100. The three survivorship curves are labeled “Type I,” “Type II,” and “Type III.” All three survivorship curves begin at 100 on the vertical axis and end at the right end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type I extends almost horizontally to the right of the vertical axis and then slopes downward, slightly at first and then more steeply, until it ends at the end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type II extends in a straight line that slants downward and to the right from the top of the vertical axis to the end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type III slopes steeply downward from the top of the vertical axis and then levels off and ends at the end of the horizontal axis.\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH909350.g02.png\" width=\"340\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The dinosaurs were <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r\"><math alttext=\"r\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists and exhibited a Type I survivorship curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The dinosaurs were <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r\"><math alttext=\"r\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists and exhibited a Type III survivorship curve</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The dinosaurs were <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K\"><math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists and exhibited a Type II survivorship curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The dinosaurs were <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K\"><math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists and exhibited a Type I survivorship curve.</p>"],"answer":1}]
