The experiment was performed with five&nbsp;different laboratory mice. Each mouse was kept in its own habitat under constant conditions of water, food, light, and temperature. Each mouse was exposed to a different concentration of carbon monoxide, and the oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin was measured.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 5 bars of data titled “Oxygen Saturation and Carbon Monoxide Levels in Mice.” The horizontal axis is labeled Percent Carbon Monoxide and the following 5 categories are indicated along the axis: 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%. The vertical axis is labeled Percent Oxygen Saturation of Hemoglobin and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated.  The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Bar 1, 0% carbon monoxide, 95% oxygen saturation. Bar 2, 20% carbon monoxide, 80% oxygen saturation. Bar 3, 40% carbon monoxide, 70% oxygen saturation. Bar 4, 60% carbon monoxide, 42% oxygen saturation. Bar 5, 80% carbon monoxide, 19% oxygen saturation.\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR093490.g02.png\" width=\"340\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Carbon monoxide improves oxygen transport in mammals.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Oxygen saturation prevents the body from absorbing carbon monoxide from the air.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Oxygen saturation enhances the uptake of carbon monoxide from the air.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Carbon monoxide impairs the transport of oxygen in the bloodstream.</p>"],"answer":3}]
