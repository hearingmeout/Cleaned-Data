The surveys were conducted at different locations on the islands by counting the number of lizards observed per hour and included habitats with both undisturbed areas and anthropogenically disturbed areas.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span style=\"font-size:1.3em;\">Lizard Numbers on Pacific Islands</span></p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a graph of two curves titled “Lizard Numbers on Pacific Islands.” The vertical axis is labeled “Lizards Counted per Hour,” and the following numbers are indicated: 10 to the 0 power, 10 to the first power, 10 to the second power, and 10 to the third power. The horizontal axis is labeled “Habitat Types,” and there are five types indicated. A rightward pointing arrow is indicated at the top of the graph. The left end of the arrow is labeled Undisturbed, and the right end is labeled Highly disturbed. A key indicates that one curve represents Mongoose-free islands, and the other curve represents Mongoose-present islands. The data represented by each curve are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The curve representing Mongoose-free islands: Primary Forest, 10 to the 0.8 power. Secondary Forest, 10 to the 1.3 power. Clearings, Gardens, 10 to the 1.7 power. Sugarcane Fields, 10 to the 1.6 power. Hotels, Parks, and Walking Trails, 10 to the 1.2 power. The curve representing Mongoose-present islands: Primary Forest, 10 to the 0.3 power. Secondary Forest, 10 to the 0.5 power. Clearings, Gardens, 10 to the first power. Sugarcane Fields, 10 to the 1.1 power.
