The left side of the horizontal axis is labeled Male, and the numbers 10 through 0, in increments of 2, are indicated from left to right. The right side of the axis is labeled Female, and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 2, are indicated from left to right. The vertical axis is labeled Age, and Birth and 100 are indicated. There are 20 age cohorts shown. The data represented in the age structure diagram are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The first age cohort shows 3 percent male and 3.3 percent female. As the age cohorts increase, the population generally remains stable until it reaches the twelfth age cohort, where the percent of the population begins a gradual decline, slightly more severely for male than females, reaching 0.2 percent male and 0.2 percent female in the last age cohort.\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR094165.g04.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Country A is growing rapidly, and most individuals are of pre-reproductive age.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Country A is growing slowly, and the total fertility rate is high.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Country A is fairly stable, and birth rates are low.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Country A is decreasing slowly, and most individuals are of post-reproductive age.</p>"],"answer":2}]
