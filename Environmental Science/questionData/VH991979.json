A key indicates two categories of energy are shown in the diagram: energy reflected back and energy absorbed. Three layers are shown in the diagram: the sun, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and areas of land. The flow of solar radiation is as follows. Energy is reflected off of sea ice back into the atmosphere. The ocean absorbs energy from incoming solar radiation. Energy is reflected off the clouds back into the atmosphere. Forested land absorbs energy from incoming solar radiation and also reflects some energy back into the atmosphere. Energy from incoming solar radiation is reflected off glaciers and snow in mountainous areas back into the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions, combustion of fossil fuels, and agricultural land are also depicted in the diagram with no apparent interaction with reflected or absorbed energy from solar radiation.\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH991965.g03.png\" width=\"550\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The oceans would be warmed because of increased solar radiation being absorbed by the water, causing expansion and sea level rise.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The oceans would be cooled from melting ice caps and glaciers, causing an increase in ocean currents and sea level rise.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The oceans would absorb the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, causing an increase in ocean <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p H\"><math alttext=\"p H\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>pH</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and a decrease in temperature.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The oceans would have greater rates of evaporation from increased surface water temperatures, causing a decrease in the amount of nutrients in the water and a decrease in sea level.</p>"],"answer":0}]
