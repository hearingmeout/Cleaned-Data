They plan to measure the density of a species of algae growing along the bottom of a river that flows through their town. The town is built in a heavily forested area, but a large area of trees along the river was recently clear-cut to allow for the construction of a new housing development, which has caused exposed soil to wash into the river. The river flows north to south through the town and is still forested both up- and downstream of the town.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tract of land that was clear-cut for the housing development</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A tract of land in a heavily forested area outside of town</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The density of a species of algae growing along the bottom of the river</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The flow rate of the river from north to south</p>"],"answer":2}]
