The description of each category is as follows. 0 to 20: Most of Canada, the western half of the United States, Mexico, most of Central America, the western coast and southern portion of South America, large parts of northern Africa, small parts of central and southern Africa, most of Australia, New Zealand, and most of Europe and Asia, with the exception of southern parts of India and parts of Southeast Asia. 21 to 50: a strip of land in North America, extending from New England to eastern Texas, a string of land through the northern part of central Africa, strips of land in southern Africa and Madagascar, and a small region in northern Australia. 51 to 100: the region encompassing the middle Atlantic and southern United States, the Caribbean, a region extending from southern Central America to northern South America, a large region in eastern South America, a majority of central and southern Africa, a strip of land in Madagascar, southern India, portions of Southeast Asia, and eastern Australia. 101 to 136: a large region in northern South America, a small region along the east coast of South America, and a small region along the west coast in central Africa.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR188538.g02.png\" width=\"590\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Biodiversity around the world is changing as a result of anthropogenic influences.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:Ai part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"Ai\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) The map represents species richness of amphibians around the globe.
