The diagram shows two circular flow charts depicting the transmission of the virus from life form to life form. The flow chart on the left is centered around a jungle. Transmission begins with mosquitoes after which it is transferred to Chimpanzees, Monkeys, and Baboons, who transfer the virus back to Mosquitoes who then carry it to a human population in a city which is represented in the second flow chart. After infecting humans the virus is transferred back to mosquitos who continue the process of infecting humans. The virus can also be transmitted during pregnancy.\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH978899.g02.png\" width=\"455\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Chimpanzees</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Mosquitoes</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Tree pollen</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Urban areas</p>"],"answer":1}]
