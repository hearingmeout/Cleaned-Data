Accelerating deforestation and rising carbon pollution are likely to make climate change worse, which could have disastrous consequences for the ability of many species to survive on earth.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Dr. Ceballos struck a slightly more hopeful tone, adding that some species have been able to rebound when some of these pressures are taken away. …</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">\"From The New York Times.
