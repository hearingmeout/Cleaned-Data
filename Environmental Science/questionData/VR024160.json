The original habitat shows 4 irregular polygons arranged roughly in two rows and two columns. Scenario 1 shows 4 irregular polygons in the same arrangement as the original habitat, and each polygon is the same shape as, but smaller than, its corresponding polygon in the original habitat. Scenario 2 shows 2 irregular polygons that are identical to the polygons in the upper left and lower right of the original habitat, but the polygons in the upper right and lower left of the original habitat are missing from scenario 2. Scenario 3 shows what looks like the same polygons in the same arrangement from the original habitat, but each polygon is bisected by a narrow strip cut through its central region.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR024154.g04.png\" width=\"295\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Scenario 1 experienced habitat fragmentation, while Scenarios 2 and 3 experienced habitat loss only.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Scenarios 1 and 2 experienced habitat loss, while Scenarios 3 experienced habitat fragmentation only.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">All scenarios experienced habitat loss, but only Scenario 3 experienced habitat fragmentation.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">All scenarios experienced habitat fragmentation, but only Scenario 2 experienced habitat loss.</p>"],"answer":2}]
