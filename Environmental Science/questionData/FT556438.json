Acorns are a critical food for white-footed mice (<em>Peromyscus leucopus</em>). Mice are important predators of the pupal stage of the gypsy moth (<em>Lymantria dispar</em>). This introduced insect periodically undergoes outbreaks that defoliate millions of hectares of oak forests, decreasing tree growth, survival, and acorn crop production. An abundance of acorns provides food for white-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>). Mice and deer are the primary hosts of the black-legged tick (I<em>xodes scapularis</em>), which carries Lyme disease.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In the space provided below, diagram a food web based on the interrelationships of the organisms identified in the excerpt.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Design a controlled experiment that tests the relationship between acorn production and gypsy moth population.
