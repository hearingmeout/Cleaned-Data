The diagram shows two circular flow charts depicting the transmission of the virus from life form to life form. The flow chart on the left is centered around a jungle. Transmission begins with mosquitoes after which it is transferred to Chimpanzees, Monkeys, and Baboons, who transfer the virus back to Mosquitoes who then carry it to a human population in a city which is represented in the second flow chart. After infecting humans the virus is transferred back to mosquitos who continue the process of infecting humans.
