It has soil moisture content on the x-axis with 14 evenly spaced tick marks along the axis. The y-axis shows the number of organisms. The curve starts on the x-axis at the first tick mark after the origin, is briefly increasing and concave up, then becomes increasing and concave down around the third tick mark, reaches a maximum at the sixth tick mark about two thirds of the way up the y-axis, is decreasing and concave down until about the eighth tick mark, and then is decreasing and concave up until meeting the x-axis at the tenth tick mark. The graph on the right is for species two. It is the same as the graph for species 1 except the line is dashed instead of solid, and the curve is shifted three tick marks to the right.  \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/9ec2f553bdde21760d76b08c001ecc4d/original.png\">\n<p>The diagrams above show the range of tolerance for soil moisture content for two different species of terrestrial invertebrate: Species 1 and Species 2.
