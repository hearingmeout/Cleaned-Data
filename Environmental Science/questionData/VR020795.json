The curve reaches its highest points in March and September and reaches its lowest point in June, and its start and end points in January and December are both approximately halfway between its highest and lowest points. The curve for location 2 starts in January at approximately one quarter of the way up the vertical axis, rises to a high point in June that is slightly above the location 1 low point in that month, and then descends to end in December at approximately the same height at which the curve started.\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR020770.g09.png\" width=\"380\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gross primary productivity is the same for both locations all year.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gross primary productivity in Location 2 is greater than that in Location 1 in December.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gross primary productivity in Location 1 is greater than that in Location 2 in March.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gross primary productivity in Location 2 is greater than that in Location 1 in September.</p>"],"answer":2}]
