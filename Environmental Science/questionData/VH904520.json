Which of the following graphs best demonstrates the change in the frequencies of light-colored moths and dark-colored moths in the population from 1950 to 2000? The dark-colored moths are represented with a solid line and the light-colored moths are represented with a dashed line.</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH904520_rubric","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot, titled “Percent of Dark- and Light-Colored Moths Found on Trees in England.” The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1800 through 1950, in increments of 25, are indicated.

Birds prey on the moths that are easily visible on trees. The researchers observed moths on tree trunks and recorded their body color. The percentage of moths with light colored bodies and the percentage of moths with dark bodies is shown on the graph above.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of two curves in the coordinate plane.
