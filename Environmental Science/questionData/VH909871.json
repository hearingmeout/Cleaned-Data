The vertical axis is labeled “Age Group” and includes 18 age groups. They are as follows, from bottom to top. 0 to 4; 5 to 9; 10 to 14; 15 to 19; 20 to 24; 25 to 29; 30 to 34; 35 to 39; 40 to 44; 45 to 49; 50 to 54; 55 to 59; 60 to 64; 65 to 69; 70 to 74; 75 to 79; 80 to 84; and 85 plus. Diagram A is narrow at the bottom, becomes more narrow in the age groups 20-24 and 25-29 and then widens at the top. The widest part of the diagram are the bars for age groups 65-69 and 70-74.\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH909868.g22.png\" width=\"465\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents an age structure diagram titled “Age Structure Diagram B.” There are two sides.
