A containment structure is shown with two components. The first component contains control rods and a reactor and the second unit is a steam generator. Water flows from the first component to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. Water also flows from the steam generator into another structure that contains a turbine and a condenser. The water flows downward through the turbine, past the condenser, back to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. The turbine is connected to an exterior generator, which is connected by powerline to a city. A cooling tower and a reservoir are also shown outside of the power plant.
