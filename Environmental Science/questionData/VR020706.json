The horizontal axis is labeled Population, in thousands, and the numbers 0 to 950, in intervals of 190, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Age Groups, and 21 groups, in 5 year intervals, are indicated. The left side of the pyramid represents male population and the right side represents female population. The data are as follows. The youngest age group, 0 through 4 years, is the largest with a male population of approximately 950,000 and a female population of approximately 930,000. Population decreases steadily from one age group to the next going up the pyramid. For age group 20 through 24, the male and female populations are 565,000 and 570,000, respectively. For age group 35 through 39, the male and female populations are 270,000 and 330,000, respectively. For age group 50 through 54, the male and female populations are 160,000 and 190,000, respectively. For age group 65 through 69, the male and female populations are 80,000 and 100,000, respectively. All the higher age groups have male and female populations of less than 100,000 each.\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR020706.g04.png\" width=\"522\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Rapid population growth</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Slow population growth</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Declining population growth</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No net change in population growth</p>"],"answer":0}]
