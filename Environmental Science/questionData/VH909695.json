Each stage of the cycle is labeled with a specific amount of phosphorus. In the ocean, burial flux, which is labeled 2 through 3 occurs. There is a downward pointing arrow from burial flux to sediments, which is labeled 8.4 times 10 to the power 8. An arrow, labeled subduction and accretion/uplift, extends to the left, then upward from sediments to weathering. There is a downward slanted arrow from weathering to soil, which is labeled 120,000. Phosphorus cycles between biological organisms and soil is in a steady state, and is labeled 200. Plants are labeled 2,600. Dissolved phosphorus from rivers, which is labeled 2 through 3, flows into the oceans.
