Phosphates in Solution are found in a body of water. There is an arrow from phosphates in solution to an image of rocks underground. From the rocks there are two arrows. One arrow is drawn to phosphates in soil and one is drawn to a rock formation above ground. From phosphates in soil there are two arrows drawn out. One is drawn back to phosphates in solution. One is drawn upward towards the roots of a tree. The tree has the label plant tissues above it. There is an arrow from the tree to a deer. There is an arrow for the deer to phosphates in soil with the label urine. There is a second arrow from the deer to an image of a mushroom and a worm with the label animal tissues and feces. The mushroom and work have an arrow drawn downward to phosphates in soil.\" height=\"361\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH901984.g03.png\" width=\"550\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements is best supported by the diagram of the phosphorus cycle?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH901984_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The largest reservoir of phosphorus is in the atmosphere.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The phosphates absorbed by animal tissue through consumption eventually return to the soil.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Plants take up the phosphate ions primarily from the metamorphic rocks.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Phosphates are not soluble in water.</p>"],"answer":1}]
