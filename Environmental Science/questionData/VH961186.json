The turbine connects to a structure labeled B. Structure B is connected to a transformer, which is connected to a switchyard. From the turbine, arrows are shown to a structure labeled D. Arrows move through additional steam lines to a structure labeled A. From A, arrows are in lines containing cooling water looping back to structure D.
