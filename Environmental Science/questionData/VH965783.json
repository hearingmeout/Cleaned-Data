Infected individuals can experience a range of symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and extreme thirst. If symptoms persist and severe dehydration results, an infected individual can die within hours of symptom onset. The diagram below shows how cholera is transmitted.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a flow chart titled Cholera Disease Transmission. Six stages are shown in the flow chart, as follows. Stage 1: V. cholera is a microscopic free living bacterium that is naturally found in wetlands, estuaries, and standing water. Stage 2 shows an image of a person retrieving water from a body of water. Pollutants offer nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that increase algal growth, which can cause increases in the population size of V. cholera. Stage 3: Using water from contaminated sources for food preparation and drinking can increase the risk of cholera infection. Stage 4: the bacterium passes into the digestive system after a person consumes contaminated food or water. Stage 5: Cholera symptoms appear 2 hours to 5 days after initial consumption of contaminated food or water. Stage 6: V. cholera exists in the body in feces and can survive in aquatic environments for up to 14 days. Stage 6 flows back into Stage 1 via the excretion of feces that returns to the water supply.\" height=\"544\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH965779.g05.png\" width=\"520\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">V. cholerae</span> is a parasitic bacterium often found in moving water, such as rivers and streams.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Symptoms of the disease can appear anywhere from 2 hours to 5 days after initial ingestion of contaminated food or water.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The bacterium that causes cholera is spread through ingestion of contaminated water or food.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">V. cholerae</span> can survive in feces and aquatic environments for up to 2 months.</p>"],"answer":2}]
