Atmosphere is labeled at the top of the diagram, a cross section of a body of water to the lower left, and a cross section of the earth's crust to the lower right. The earth's crust shows underground deposits of limestone, oil and gas, and coal. On the earth's surface there are plants and animals as well as the outline of an oil well and a car next to a gasoline pump. A series of arrows are drawn; three arrows point upward toward the atmosphere and two arrows point downward away from the atmosphere. One downward arrow goes to the body of water and a label C O 2 in water, which continues through the label decaying organic matter, which points into calcium carbonate sediments. In the water, a label for photosynthesis (aquatic food chains) also points to the calcium carbonate sediments. In the water there is another label for plankton and two arrows, one that points to a fish and the other to organic sediments. Two arrows labeled over time respectively lead from calcium carbonate sediments to a deposit of limestone and from organic sediments to a deposit of oil and gas. The second arrow pointing downward from the atmosphere points to label photosynthesis (terrestrial food chains) and to land based plants and animals, which in turn has an arrow labeled over time that leads to a deposit of coal. Oil and gas are shown being pumped to the surface and going into an automobile. A line from the underground coal joins a line from the automobile in an arrow labeled combustion of fossil fuels that points upward to the atmosphere. Another arrow labeled burning of forests, and organic debris points up from a tree to the atmosphere. Another arrow labeled respiration and decomposition points upward from the body of water to the atmosphere.\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR026569.g07.png\" width=\"565\" /></div>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR026569_rubric","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">Write your answers in the spaces provided.
