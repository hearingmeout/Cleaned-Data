Manatees are large, aquatic, herbivorous mammals that primarily eat seagrass. Manatees can travel several miles to graze. Manatees mature slowly, have low biotic potential, and inhabit warm coastal waters. They cannot survive in water below <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"20 degrees Celsius\"><math alttext=\"20 degrees Celsius\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>20</mn><mtext>°C</mtext></math></span></span> for extended periods of time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Satellite Track and Water Temperature Log of the Movement of One Adult Manatee Over a 12-Hour Period</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a diagram titled “Satellite Track and Water Temperature Log of the Movement of One Adult Manatee Over a 12 Hour Period.” A key indicates that non-shaded areas represent Urban land, shaded areas represent Bay water, and patterned areas represent Seagrass beds. The key also indicates three water temperatures, where a circle represents 13 to 19 degrees Celsius, a square represents 20 to 23 degrees Celsius, and a triangle represents 24 to 26 degrees Celsius. Urban land is indicated along the right edge and bottom edge of the diagram, and near the top left corner of the diagram, separated by bay water. Five boats are indicated throughout the bay, and a power plant is indicated near the middle section of the shore, on the right edge of the diagram. A region near the urban land at the top left corner of the diagram is seagrass beds. The movement of the manatee is indicated by a line that begins in the seagrass beds with five circles scattered throughout this region. The line then moves toward the power plant across the bay. In the middle of the bay, four circles are indicated along the line. As it nears the shore, there are two squares indicated on the line. Finally, as it reaches the shore, very close to the power plant, there are four triangles indicated on the line. Two of the five boats in the bay are above the line indicating water temperature, and the other three boats are below the line indicating water temperature.\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR734084.g05.svg\" width=\"700\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Based on the information in the diagram, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">identify</span> the temperature range of the water through which the majority of the adult manatee’s daily movement occurs.</p>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR734084_rubric"},{"id":"VR734084","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:b part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"b\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Large groups of manatees are often observed in shallow waters near the waste water released by the electrical power plant during the winter.
