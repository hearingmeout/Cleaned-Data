Oils sands contain bitumen, which can be processed into a synthetic crude oil. A region of boreal forest in Alberta, Canada, that covers a deposit of oil sands will be cut and removed during the process of bitumen extraction. It is estimated that the deposit contains 73 billion barrels of recoverable bitumen. The rate of extraction from the deposit will be approximately 1 million barrels of bitumen per day.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> one ecological benefit, other than providing habitat, that is provided by forests.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR041097_rubric"},{"id":"VR041097","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:b part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"b\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> one economic benefit that is provided by forests.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR041097_rubric"},{"id":"VR041097","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:c part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"c\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> TWO environmental consequences, other than those related to the loss of boreal forest habitat, that result from the extraction of bitumen or the transportation of synthetic oil to customers.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR041097_rubric"},{"id":"VR041097","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:d part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"d\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Assuming the above extraction rate, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">calculate</span> how many days will be needed to extract the recoverable volume of bitumen from the oil sands.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR041097_rubric"},{"id":"VR041097","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:e part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"e\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Calculate</span> how many years will be needed to fully extract the recoverable volume of bitumen from the oil sands.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR041097_rubric"},{"id":"VR041097","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:f part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"f\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(f) Monthly production of synthetic crude oil is 30 million barrels.
