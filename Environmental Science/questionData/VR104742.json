A containment structure is shown with two components. The first component contains control rods and a reactor and the second unit is a steam generator. Water flows from the first component to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. Water also flows from the steam generator into another structure that contains a turbine and a condenser. The water flows downward through the turbine, past the condenser, back to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. The turbine is connected to an exterior generator, which is connected by powerline to a city. A cooling tower and a reservoir are also shown outside of the power plant. Water flows from the reservoir through the condenser, out to the cooking tower, and continues in a circular fashion.\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR104723.g06.png\" width=\"465\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Absorption of incoming solar radiation</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Fusion of atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Combustion of fossil fuels</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Fission in radioactive fuel</p>"],"answer":3}]
