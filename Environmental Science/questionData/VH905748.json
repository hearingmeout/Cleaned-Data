An arrow indicating decomposition extends downward from a goat and rabbit, to the decomposers. Another arrow indicating cellular respiration extends upward from the goat and rabbit to C O 2 in the atmosphere. From a set of trees, an arrow indicating consumption extends downward to the goat and the rabbit.
