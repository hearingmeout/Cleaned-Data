Step 3 occurs when Ammonium, N H 4, with a positive one charge, is converted to Nitrite and Nitrate, N O 2, with a negative one charge, and N O 3, with a negative one charge. Step 4 occurs when Nitrite and Nitrate, N O 2, with a negative one charge, and N O 3, with a negative one charge, is converted to Nitrogen Gas, N 2.
