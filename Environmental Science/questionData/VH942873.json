Several students brought in a sample of soil from their backyards. Each student added their soil sample of equal mass to a jar with exactly the same amount of water, shook the contents so that all soil particles were suspended in the water, and left the jars covered overnight. The next morning, the soil particles had settled out into layers and students could determine the percentage of each type of particle. The results of their soil test are shown below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram of three soil samples in jars titled “Soil Texture Test Results.” The jar on the left is labeled Soil Sample A and contains 10 percent clay, 10 percent silt, and 80 percent sand.
