Researchers are interested in understanding the impact of pollution on turtle nesting sites. The researchers examined nesting sites at two agricultural areas along the floodplain of a river upstream and downstream from a chemical factory that is a known source of aqueous mercury pollution. Turtle eggs, soil, and vegetation samples taken from areas around turtle nests downstream from the chemical factory showed high levels of mercury in a previous study. Mercury was not detected in samples taken upstream from the chemical factory.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span style=\"font-size:1.3em;\">Distribution of Turtle Nests Along River</span></p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a map of a river titled “Distribution of Turtle Nests Along River.” A key indicates that a point represents a Successful turtle nest, and an x represents an Unsuccessful turtle nest. The river flows from top to bottom and passes the following: forest area, Area A, chemical factory with a discharge pipe that extends over the river, and Area B. The forest area follows along the right edge of the river. The chemical factory is indicated on the left side of the river, about halfway down the river. Area A is indicated near the top of the river, just to the right of the forest area, and has 14 successful turtle nests, and 4 unsuccessful turtle nests. Area B is indicated near the bottom of the river, just to the right of the forest area, and has 4 successful turtle nests, and 5 unsuccessful turtle nests. The 5 unsuccessful turtle nests in Area B are indicated closer to the river than the 4 successful turtle nests.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR598479.g05.svg\"
