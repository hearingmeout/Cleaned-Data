They require large amounts of land and have a high carbon footprint.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Seafood harvested from aquaculture has a larger carbon footprint than seafood harvested from fisheries. Aquaculture requires large amounts of fossil fuels and releases more greenhouse gases than fisheries do because the fish are more concentrated.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Grass-fed beef has the highest carbon-equivalent footprint because of land-use changes to create pasture land combined with contributions from transportation, processing, manure treatment, making fertilizers, and digestive fermentation processes.</p>"],"answer":3}]
