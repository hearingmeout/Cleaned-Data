Smaller-beaked finches are better suited for eating grasses and small seeds. Larger-beaked finches are better suited for cracking larger seeds and nuts. In 1977 a drought took place and the vegetation of the island was affected by the lack of rain.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The total number of finches in the population increased, and the smaller-beaked finches were more successful in the drier environment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The total number of finches in the population increased, and the larger-beaked finches were more successful in the drier environment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The total number of finches in the population decreased, and the smaller-beaked finches were more successful in the drier environment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The total number of finches in the population decreased, and the larger-beaked finches were more successful in the drier environment.</p>"],"answer":3}]
