The parking lot is slightly sloped so the rainwater flows toward the gardens. The runoff from the roof is collected by various downspouts and directed toward the gardens. Scientists at the agency plan to monitor the effectiveness by measuring the water quality of the storm water as it moves through the gardens during and after storm events.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Flowering plant species so that offspring are genetically different from the parent plants</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Flood-tolerant plant species so that the plants can withstand large pulses of water from storms</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Invasive plant species so that the plants can reproduce rapidly once the soil is saturated from storms</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Genetically modified plant species so that the plants are resistant to drought and insect pests</p>"],"answer":1}]
