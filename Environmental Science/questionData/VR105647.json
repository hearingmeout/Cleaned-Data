The vertical axis is labeled “Grain Yield, in kilograms per hectare,” and the values 0 through 3,500, in increments of 500, are indicated. A legend shows that there are two categories of grain yield represented in the graph: Annual average from 1961 through 1963, and Annual average from 1991 through 1993. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Africa: 1961 through 1963, 900; 1991 through 1993, 1,200.
