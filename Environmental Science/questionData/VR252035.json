The diagram shows the mainland, five islands labeled A through E, and the boundaries of five tectonic plates. The direction of plate movement is indicated by arrows. The diagram is arranged as follows. The mainland is a large landmass centered at the top of the diagram. Below the mainland, at the center of the diagram, the islands are clustered together. Island A is located closest to the mainland. Island C is below Island A. Island B is to the left of Islands A and C. Island D is below Islands B and C. Island E is to the left of Island D. A hot spot is indicated to the left of Island E. Plate 1 is located at the top of the diagram, completely encompassing the mainland. The borders of Plate 1 move along the coast of the mainland, and are shared with Plate 3 on its left side and Plate 5 on its right side. Plate 2 is located at the center of the diagram, directly below Plate 1. It encompasses all of the islands and the hot spot. Its borders are shared with Plate 1 on its top side, Plate 4 on its bottom side, Plate 3 on its left side, and Plate 5 on its right side. Plate 3 is located on the left side of the diagram, and shares borders with Plate 1 on its top side, Plate 2 on its right side, and Plate 4 on its bottom side. Plate 4 is located at the bottom of the diagram, and shares borders with Plates 3, 2, and 5 on its top side, from left to right. Plate 5 is located on the right side of the diagram, and shares borders with Plates 1 and 2 on its left side, from top to bottom, and Plate 4 on its bottom side. The arrows indicating the direction of plate movement are drawn as follows. An arrow pointing vertically downward is drawn at the bottom of Plate 1. Directly below this arrow, an arrow pointing vertically upward is drawn at the top of Plate 2. An arrow pointing horizontally to the right is drawn at the right side of Plate 2. Directly to the right of this arrow, an arrow pointing horizontally to the left is drawn on the left side of Plate 5. An arrow pointing vertically upward is drawn at the bottom of Plate 2. Directly below this arrow, an arrow pointing vertically downward is drawn at the top of Plate 4. An arrow pointing vertically upward is drawn at the left side of Plate 2. Directly to the left of this arrow, an arrow pointing vertically downward is drawn at the right side of Plate 3.\" height=\"280\"
