The horizontal axis is labeled Precipitation, in centimeters per year, and the numbers 0 through 450, in increments of 50, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Air Temperature, in degrees Celsius, and the numbers negative 15 through 30, in increments of 5, are indicated. Note that all values are approximate. In the diagram, a curved line begins at 0 centimeters per year and 30 degrees Celsius. It slowly moves downward and to the right until it reaches 450 centimeters per year and 27 degrees Celsius. The curved line then turns to steeply move downward and to the left, and ends at 0 centimeters per year and negative 15 degrees Celsius. The region of the diagram that is enclosed within the vertical axis and the curved line is divided into nine sections, which vary in shape and size. Each section represents a different terrestrial biome, which are labeled as follows: Desert, Tundra, Boreal forest, Woodland or grassland, Temperate forest, Temperate wet forest, Savanna, Tropical dry forest, and Tropical wet forest. The data represented in the diagram are as follows. 1. Desert: Precipitation, from 0 up to 50 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from negative 15 up to 30 degrees Celsius. 2. Tundra: Precipitation, from 0 up to 110 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from negative 15 up to negative 4 degrees Celsius. 3. Boreal forest: Precipitation, from 30 up to 150 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from negative 6 up to 3 degrees Celsius. 4. Woodland or grassland: Precipitation, from 10 up to 125 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from negative 6.5 up to 20 degrees Celsius. 5. Temperate forest: Precipitation, from 50 up to 220 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from 2.5 up to 18.5 degrees Celsius. 6. Temperate wet forest: Precipitation, from 110 up to 340 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from negative 4 up to 20 degrees Celsius. 7. Savanna: Precipitation, from 30 up to 130 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from 20 up to 30 degrees Celsius. 8. Tropical dry forest: Precipitation, from 125 up to 250 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from 18 up to 30 degrees Celsius. 9. Tropical wet forest: Precipitation, from 230 up to 450 centimeters per year; Air Temperature, from 19 up to 29 degrees Celsius.\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR252003.g01.png\" width=\"455\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Based on the information in the graph, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">describe</span> the air temperature range for a temperate forest.</p>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252003_rubric"},{"id":"VR252003","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:b part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"b\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Based on the information in the graph, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">identify</span> the biome most likely to be encountered at any latitude.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252003_rubric"},{"id":"VR252003","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:c part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"c\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) The rate of carbon cycling is faster in a tropical wet forest than in a desert.

The students hypothesized that there would be more insect biodiversity in the leaf litter at the nature preserve than at the managed site. The leaf litter from each site was placed into a funnel with a light shone on the top to drive any insects out of the litter. Species were collected in an alcohol-filled container below the funnel, and the species were identified using magnifying lenses and a key.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(h) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> the dependent variable in the experiment.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252003_rubric"},{"id":"VR252003","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:i part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"i\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(i) One variable not mentioned in the description of the experiment that could affect the results of the investigation is soil moisture level. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> the effect that soil moisture level would likely have on the results of the investigation.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252003_rubric"},{"id":"VR252003","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:j part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"j\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(j) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Explain</span> how modifying the experiment to collect samples from new and old compost piles could alter the results of the experiment.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252003_rubric"}]
