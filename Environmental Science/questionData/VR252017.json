Stream 3 runs from the top of the mountain ridge to the lake. The entire watershed is underlain by bedrock that contains some metal. A town on the lake shore is concerned because of an increase in metal contaminants in the lake.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram of a watershed. A lake is shown surrounded by two forested mountains with a ridge line between them. A town and a highway are shown on the lake shore at the bottom of the mountain. Volcanic rock is labeled below the ground surface of the mountain. A clear-cut forest is shown on one side of the mountain, and a mine with two entrances is shown on the other side of the mountain. The diagram shows mine tailings at the two mine entrances and mine tunnels leading down toward ore deposits. A cloud with rain is shown at the top of the mountain, and four streams flow down the mountain to the lake. Stream 1 is low on the left side above the town and feeds into Stream 3 just above the lake. Stream 2 starts from the clear-cut forest high on the left side and feeds into Stream 3 about halfway down the mountain. Stream 3 travels down the ridge between the mountains. Stream 4 starts from the lower mine entrance on the right side and feeds into Stream 3 about two-thirds of the way down the mountain. Streams 1, 2, and 4 are tributaries to stream 3, which flows into the lake.\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR252017.g01.png\" width=\"620\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Based on the diagram, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">describe</span> how human activities could have increased the amount of metal contaminants in stream 4.</p>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:b part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"b\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Based on the diagram, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">explain</span> why stream 1 would have less suspended sediment than stream 2.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:c part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"c\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Based on the diagram, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">make a claim</span> using evidence that a regulating ecosystem service has been devalued as a result of human activities.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:d part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"d\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) Based on the diagram, <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">describe</span> how the precipitation at high elevations would impact sedimentation in the lake.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:e part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"e\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(e) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Explain</span> how soil composition may affect levels of metal contamination in the area.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:f part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"f\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(f) Some of the miners assert that the area in which the ore is being mined must have been located at a convergent plate boundary. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Make a claim</span> using evidence that supports or opposes the miners’ assertion.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR252017_rubric"},{"id":"VR252017","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:g part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"g\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(g) The mining company claims that they cannot extract enough ore from the mine and wants permission to convert the mine into a strip mine.
