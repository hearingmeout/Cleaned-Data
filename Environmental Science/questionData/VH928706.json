The Thermosphere is between 85 kilometers and 120 kilometers. A curve begins near approximately three quarters of the way along the horizontal axis at 0 kilometers, and moves slightly upward and to the left until it reaches approximately 17 kilometers and approximately a quarter of the way along the horizontal axis. The curve then moves to upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 49 kilometers and approximately three quarters of the way along the horizontal axis.
