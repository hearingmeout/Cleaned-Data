Raw sewage flows into the system and moves through a series of screens and then into a comminutor. It then flows into a grit chamber, where the grit is removed and the wastewater moves into the clarifier. The process continues in a clarifier, and the material can take either of two paths. Raw sludge flows out of the clarifier and is removed from the system through sludge treatment and disposal. The other path shows effluent flowing out of the clarifier and into an aeration tank, which is run by an air compressor. Effluent then flows into a clarifier and can then take either of two paths. Fluid can be discharged to the surface water or if needed, can flow to a tertiary treatment system. The other path shows activated sludge flowing out of the clarifier, which can either be expelled from the system as sludge, or it can flow through a return sludge pump and back into the aeration tank, from which the cycle continues.\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH979323.g02.png\" width=\"615\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Wet scrubbers</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Filters</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Coagulants</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Disinfectants</p>"],"answer":3}]
