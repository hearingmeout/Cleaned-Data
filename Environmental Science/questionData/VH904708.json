The vertical axis is labeled “Total Number of Plant Species Present,” and the numbers 0 through 300, in increments of 50, are indicated. A vertical dashed line is drawn at the year 1980 and is labeled “Eruption.” The graph is a curve that begins in 1976 at approximately 290 plant species. The curve fluctuates slightly until it reaches the Eruption point in 1980, where it declines vertically at first to 250 plant species. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches approximately 20 plant species in 1983. The curve then moves steadily upward and to the right until it reaches 1994 and approximately 125 plant species. \" height=\"260\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH904707.g01.png\" width=\"475\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The temperature of Earth rises and biodiversity increases immediately after a volcanic eruption.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The carrying capacity of plants in the area is approximately 250 species.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">After the volcanic eruption, pioneer species colonized the area and the ecosystem began to undergo succession.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Plant species that are well adapted will survive and reproduce, leading to a change in the ecosystem biodiversity through the process of natural selection.</p>"],"answer":2}]
