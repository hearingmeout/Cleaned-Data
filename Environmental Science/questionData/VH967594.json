Over nine million people live in the small watershed area that feeds into the sound. To determine the effect of the population density on the watershed, scientists measured the oxygen content of bottom waters in the sound. The data from late summer 2013 are displayed in the map below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a map of Long Island Sound titled, Dissolved Oxygen Content, in milligrams per liter, in Long Island Sound, August 2013. A key shows that four ranges of data are shown on the map: 1.00 through 1.99 milligrams per liter, 2.00 through 2.99 milligrams per liter, 3.00 through 3.49 milligrams per liter, and 3.50 through 4.75 milligrams per liter. The concentration of dissolved oxygen content is 1.00 through 1.99 milligrams per liter at the innermost portion of the sound near New York City. The concentration decreases outside of that area to 2.00 through 2.99 milligrams per liter. The mid-outermost portions of the sound generally vary in range between 3.00 through 3.49 milligrams per liter and 3.50 through 4.75 milligrams per liter.\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH967590.g04.png\" width=\"520\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Overfishing</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Plastic pollution</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Sewage treatment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Restricted circulation</p>"],"answer":3}]
