[{"id":"VH981294","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the diagram, which of the following is an expected consequence of runoff and sewage in an aquatic environment?</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram showing the effect of runoff and sewage from industrial processes. The diagram is separated into three layers: a factory with O 2 in the atmosphere, surface water, and bottom water. In the diagram, the process begins the factory and O 2 in the atmosphere. O2 in the atmosphere, and runoff and sewage from the factory, flow into the layer of surface water. The runoff and sewage can take either of two paths: it can flow downwards into the layer of bottom water, resulting in increased turbidity near aquatic plant life. It can also lead to eutrophication in the layer of surface water, resulting in an algal bloom. The algal bloom can take either of two paths: it can flow downwards into the bottom water via death and decay, feeding the decomposers in the bottom water resulting in high B O D, which results in reductions in harvestable fish. The algal bloom can also undergo photosynthesis while remaining in the layer of surface water.\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH981294.g05.png\" width=\"565\" /></div>\n","rubricRef":"VH981294_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreased oxygen levels in surface water as a result of a decrease in photosynthetic rates by algae</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased oxygen levels in bottom water from increased rates of cellular respiration in decomposers</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreased oxygen production by seaweed on the seafloor from an increase in turbidity</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased oxygen production by decomposition of dead fish and other aquatic organisms</p>"],"answer":2}]
