They design a laboratory experiment in which rainwater of different pH values is used to water soil samples taken from red spruce forests. The soil samples are the same size and contain the same ratios of sand, silt, and clay. The same amount of water is sprayed on the soil samples every day for a week.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR130594_rubric","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">Write your answers in the spaces provided.

The horizontal axis is labeled year, and the years 2001 through 2016, in increments of 5 years, are indicated. The left vertical axis is labeled Coal Consumption, in millions of tons, and the numbers 400 through 850, in increments of 50, are indicated. The right vertical axis is labeled Rainwater p H, and the numbers 4.4 through 5.3, in increments of 0.1, are indicated. A key indicates that one line represents p H rainwater, and the other represents Coal Consumption. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line representing p H Rainwater begins at the year 2001 comma p H 4.45 and trends upwards and to the right, fluctuating up and down as it moves. It passes through the year 2008 comma p H 4.7, moves steeply upwards and to the right to the year 2010 comma p H 5, after which it continues its trend upwards and to the right and ends at the year 2018 comma p H 5.2. The line representing Coal Consumption begins at the year 2001 comma 810 million tons and initially trends slightly downwards and to the right, passing through the year 2010 comma 760 million tons.
