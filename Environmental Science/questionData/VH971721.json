Activities such as finding desirable habitat and mates, avoiding predators, protecting young, and establishing territories are all dependent on the acoustical environment. [Wildlife is] being forced to adapt to increasing noise levels. Research shows that males of at least one frog species are adapting to traffic noise by calling at a higher pitch. This could be problematic for the females, because they prefer lower-pitched calls, which indicate larger and more experienced males.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In general, studies indicate that animals are stressed by noisy environments. The endangered Sonoran pronghorn avoids noisy areas frequented by military jets; female frogs exposed to traffic noise have more difficulty locating the male's signal; bats avoid hunting in areas with road noise. Combined with other stressors such as winter weather, disease, and food shortages, sound impacts can have important implications for the health and vitality of wildlife populations within a park.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">National parks are under increasing noise pressure. Noise levels in park transportation corridors today are many times the natural level. Sound levels during peak periods in a high air traffic corridor in the Yellowstone backcountry, for example, were elevated by up to 5 decibels. The result is as much as a 70% reduction in the size of an area in which predators can hear their prey. Increasingly, careful consideration of the impacts of human-generated noise on wildlife is a critical component of management for healthy ecosystems in our parks.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Noise pollution is being managed in such a way as to not significantly interfere with wildlife in national parks.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Noise in national parks has an overall positive effect on wildlife and has led to an increase in biodiversity.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Stressors such as winter weather, disease, and food shortages are having a greater effect on wildlife than noise pollution.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Noise pollution has a negative effect on wildlife activities such as mating, establishing territories, and predator-prey interactions.</p>"],"answer":3}]
