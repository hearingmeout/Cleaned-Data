The original habitat shows 4 irregular polygons arranged roughly in two rows and two columns. Scenario 1 shows 4 irregular polygons in the same arrangement as the original habitat, and each polygon is the same shape as, but smaller than, its corresponding polygon in the original habitat. Scenario 2 shows 2 irregular polygons that are identical to the polygons in the upper left and lower right of the original habitat, but the polygons in the upper right and lower left of the original habitat are missing from scenario 2. Scenario 3 shows what looks like the same polygons in the same arrangement from the original habitat, but each polygon is bisected by a narrow strip cut through its central region.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR024154.g04.png\" width=\"295\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased sea level would reduce the size of the habitat patches.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased carbon dioxide availability spurs plant growth, which would increase habitat size.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreased temperatures would cause unsuitable abiotic conditions.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreased precipitation would eliminate habitat patches.</p>"],"answer":0}]
