The vertical axis is labeled Energy Consumption, in quadrillion B T Us, and the numbers 0 through 250, in increments of 50, are indicated. Five different lines appear on the graph that represent the following sources of energy: liquid fuels, natural gas, coal, renewables, and nuclear. The data for each line is as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Data for liquid fuels. The line begins at the year 1990 and 137 B T Us, and gradually increases, passing through the points, the year 2000, 160 B T Us, year 2010, 180 B T Us, year 2020, 210 B T Us, year 2030, 225 B T Us, and year 2040, 248 B T Us. Data for natural gas. The line begins at the year 1990 and 87 B T Us, and gradually increases, passing through the points, the year 2000, 90 B T Us, year 2010, 149 B T Us, year 2020, 170 B T Us, year 2030, 175 B T Us, and year 2040, 180 B T Us. Data for coal. The line begins at the year 1990 and 76 B T Us, and gradually increases, passing through the points, the year 2000, 87 B T Us, year 2010, 120 B T Us, year 2020, 137 B T Us, year 2030, 175 B T Us, and year 2040, 212 B T Us. Data for renewables.
