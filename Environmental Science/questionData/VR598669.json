The Gulf of Mexico is indicated on the map. An X within a circle is also indicated and points to the northwestern part of Iowa, which is located in an agriculture/cropland area. The data for each category are as follows. Forest land use is located primarily in the eastern United States, extending southwestward from western Pennsylvania, through parts of West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky, central Tennessee, and western North Carolina. There are smaller amounts of forest land use scattered throughout Wisconsin, northern Minnesota, western Missouri, eastern Kansas, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Louisiana. Grassland land use is located primarily in the Midwest. The areas with the greatest use are Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. There are smaller amounts of grassland land use scattered throughout northeastern New Mexico, northern Texas, western Mississippi, Tennessee, western Kentucky, northern West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. Agriculture/cropland land use is located primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. There are smaller amounts of agriculture/cropland land use scattered throughout Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma, Missouri, eastern Arkansas, eastern Louisiana, southwestern Ohio, and Kentucky. Urban land use is scattered in small amounts across the midwestern states, including southwestern Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, northern Texas, Nebraska, and Colorado.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR598669.g06.svg\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:ai part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"ai\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Various land use practices can have different effects on the waters that surround a dead zone.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> the land use that covers the least amount of area in the Mississippi River watershed, based on the diagram.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:aii part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"aii\"><ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\"><li class=\"list_paragraph\">(ii) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> one way that the land use practice at location X in the diagram could contribute to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.</li></ul></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:aiii part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"aiii\"><ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\"><li class=\"list_paragraph\">(iii) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> one way that urban areas in the Mississippi River watershed could contribute to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.</li></ul></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:bi part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"bi\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) The dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico has both economic and environmental effects for coastal communities.</p><ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\"><li class=\"list_paragraph\">(i) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> how a dead zone affects marine organisms living in the Gulf of Mexico.</li></ul></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:bii part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"bii\"><ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\"><li class=\"list_paragraph\">(ii) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> one economic effect on communities along the Gulf of Mexico that can result from the presence of the dead zone.</li></ul></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:biii part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"biii\"><ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\"><li class=\"list_paragraph\">(iii) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> one factor that causes the area of the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico to increase in the summer months.</li></ul></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR598669_rubric"},{"id":"VR598669","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:ci part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"ci\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Researchers want to examine the effect of riparian vegetation buffers on water quality in streams in agricultural areas.
