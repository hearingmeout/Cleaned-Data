The flow through the sewage treatment plant is as follows. Wastewater flows into the treatment plant at step A and continues into step B. Material then can be exported from step B into two possible paths, as follows. Material can be exported as primary sludge which flows to sludge treatment and disposal, or, material can be exported into step C. Air is shown flowing into step C in the sewage treatment plant. Step C flows into an unlabeled step and can be exported from the unlabeled step into two possible paths, as follows. Material can be exported as waste activated sludge which can either flow into sludge treatment and disposal or be recycled as activated sludge, or, it can flow into step D which releases it into the environment.\" height=\"181\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR197130.g02.png\" width=\"395\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":0}]
