The vertical axis is labeled Mortality, in percent, and the numbers 20 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The data represented by the four curves are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line for pesticide A begins at the point 0 grams per cubic centimeter comma 30 percent mortality and curves upwards and to the right at an increasing rate, passing through the coordinates 500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 45 percent mortality rate and 1,000 grams per cubic centimeter comma 80 percent mortality, and it ends at the coordinates 1,500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 90 percent mortality. The line for pesticide B begins at the point 0 grams per cubic centimeter comma 50 percent mortality and moves horizontally to the right for a short distance until reaching 200 grams per cubic centimeter comma 50 percent mortality, after which it moves upwards and to the right until reaching 500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 65 percent mortality. The line then moves horizontally to the right until it ends at 1,500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 65 percent mortality. The line for pesticide C begins at 0 grams per cubic centimeter comma 23 percent mortality and trends upwards and to the right until reaching 100 grams per cubic centimeter comma 28 percent mortality. The line then moves very gradually upwards and to the right until reaching 1,000 grams per cubic centimeter comma 30 percent mortality, after which it moves steeply upwards and to the right until ending near 1,500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 95 percent mortality. The line for pesticide D begins near 0 grams per cubic centimeter comma 41 percent mortality and moves horizontally to the right until reaching 100 grams per cubic centimeter comma 41 percent mortality. The line then moves steeply upwards and to the right until reaching 500 grams per cubic centimeter comma 90 percent mortality, after which it moves nearly horizontally to the right and ends at 1,000 grams per cubic centimeter comma 100 percent mortality.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR106235.g08.png\" width=\"285\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C\"><math alttext=\"C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>D</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":3}]
