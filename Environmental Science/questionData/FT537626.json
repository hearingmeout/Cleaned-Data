The following questions(s) refer to the soil composition diagram below.</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a soil triangle. The base of the equilateral triangle is labeled percent sand with 100 percent near the left vertex and 0 percent near the right vertex. The left edge of the triangle is labeled percent clay with 0 percent near the bottom vertex and 100 percent near the top vertex. The right edge is labeled percent silt with 100 percent near the bottom vertex and 0 percent near the top vertex. Each edge has tick marks for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent. Three sets of parallel lines from the tick marks on one edge to the tick marks on the other edges form a grid of smaller triangles. The triangle is divided into sections that represent 12 different types of soils with different ranges of percent compositions of sand, silt and clay. There are five labeled points, indicated at the following locations: Point T, at the intersection of 60% sand, 30% silt, and 10% clay. Point U, at the intersection of 50% sand, 20% silt, and 30% clay. Point V, at the intersection of 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay.  Point W, at the intersection of 10% sand, 10% silt, and 80% clay. Point X, inside the triangle formed by the line drawn between 10% sand and 90% silt and the edges of the soil triangle. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/9be28830b309cc6b77509891fc5c3e7b/original.png\"></p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Sand</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Silt</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Clay</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">75</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">20</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">5</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Sand</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Silt</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Clay</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">70</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">20</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">10</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Sand</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Silt</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Clay</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">65</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">25</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">10</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Sand</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Silt</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Clay</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">60</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">30</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">10</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Sand</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Silt</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">% Clay</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">55</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">30</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">15</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":2}]
