The school board will not move forward with any property changes unless the students conduct an experiment and collect evidence to help prove that their proposed suggestion to increase water infiltration will be effective.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The students create two identical pallets using soil taken from the school’s property and install impermeable pavers similar to those found on the school’s property in one of the pallets. They install permeable pavers in the other pallet. The students pour exactly the same amount of water over both sets of pavers, leave both pallets in exactly the same environmental conditions, and after one hour measure the amount of water that infiltrated the soil.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The type of soil used in the pallets</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The type of pavers used in the pallets</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The infiltration rate of the water</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The temperature of the room that the pallets were left in</p>"],"answer":1}]
