The rows are labeled, from top to bottom; row 1, Initial DO; row 2, Amount of organic waste added; row 3, DO after one week. From top to bottom, the data is as follows: Initial DO; Tank1, 10 parts per million, Tank 2, 10 parts per million, Tank 3, 10 parts per million, Tank 4, 10 parts per million, Tank 5, 10 parts per million.
