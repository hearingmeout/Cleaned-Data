There is an arrow to from organic in plants to organic in soil with the label decay. There is an arrow from organic in soil to available inorganic in soil. There are three arrows from available inorganic in soil. One arrow points upward to the trees and the label organic in plants. A two headed arrow connects available inorganic in soil to unavailable inorganic in soil. The third arrow connects available inorganic in soil to inorganic in water.
