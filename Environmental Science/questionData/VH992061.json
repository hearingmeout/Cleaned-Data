Most of the map shows a temperature change of 0.0 degrees Celsius through positive 1.0 degree Celsius. The following areas show a temperature change of positive 2.0 through positive 4.1 degrees Celsius: Alaska and a small area of Northwest Canada, a small area of the coast of Southern Baja, the extreme Northeast of Russia, and a small area of central Siberia. The following areas show a temperature change of positive 1.0 through positive 2.0 degrees Celsius: the perimeter of Alaska, western Canada and the United States, the eastern portions of the Pacific ocean, northeast area of Russia, central Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Northern China, Northern Australia, small areas off the coast Quebec, the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, the Southern Atlantic Ocean near Antarctica, and in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH992047.g03.png\" width=\"465\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n\n<img alt=\"The figure presents a graph titled Average Change in Surface Temperature, in degrees Celsius by Latitude.
