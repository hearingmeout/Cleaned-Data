Extant species of cycads share many traits with those from the Mesozoic era. Cycads bear cones, are long-lived with slow growth rates, show late reproductive maturity, and have very few offspring.

The horizontal axis is labeled “Time.” The vertical axis is labeled “Percentage of Organisms Surviving.” The numbers 1, 10, and 100 are indicated from bottom to top along the vertical axis, with 10 halfway between 1 and 100. The three survivorship curves are labeled “Type I,” “Type II,” and “Type III.” All three survivorship curves begin at 100 on the vertical axis and end at the right end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type I extends almost horizontally to the right of the vertical axis and then slopes downward, slightly at first and then more steeply, until it ends at the end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type II extends in a straight line that slants downward and to the right from the top of the vertical axis to the end of the horizontal axis. Survivorship curve type III slopes steeply downward from the top of the vertical axis and then levels off and ends at the end of the horizontal axis.\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH909350.g02.png\" width=\"340\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K\"><math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists with a Type I survivorship curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r\"><math alttext=\"r\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists with a Type III survivorship curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"K\"><math alttext=\"K\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists with a Type III survivorship curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r\"><math alttext=\"r\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-strategists with a Type II survivorship curve.</p>"],"answer":0}]
