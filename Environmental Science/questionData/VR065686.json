They depend on scent to avoid predators, sniff out prey, and find their way home at the end of their lives ….

Fish were placed in a holding tank and exposed to the smell of salmon-skin extract, which indicates a predator attack and usually prompts the fish to hide or swim away. Fish that were in water with current <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C O 2\"><math> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math></span></span> levels responded normally to the offending odor, but the fish from tanks with higher <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C O 2\"><math> <mstyle> <mrow> <msub> <mrow> <mtext>CO</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mstyle> </math></span></span> levels didn't seem to mind or detect the smell.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">…</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">While this study looked specifically at how an altered sense of smell could affect fishes' response to danger, it's likely that other critical behaviors that depend on smell, such as navigation, reproduction, and hunting for food, would also take a hit if fish aren't able to adequately process smells. …</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">University of Washington</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best identifies the author’s claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR065686_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Acidic water affects the salmon’s ability to sense danger from attacking predators by their sense of smell.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Salmon can only tolerate certain water temperatures before all of their senses are severely damaged.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Acidic water prevents salmon from maturing and therefore from being able to reproduce and replenish declining salmon populations.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Acidic water is causing a rise in the population of predators as a result of the salmon’s increased ability to smell predators.</p>"],"answer":0}]
