There are no numbers but there are four evenly spaced tick marks about the x-axis. A legend says that the bar color indicates population density with light being low and dark being high. Site A unfragmented on the x-axis has a white bar up to the third tick mark,  a light gray bar just above the second tick mark, a dark gray bar just below the third tick mark, and a black bar just above the third tick mark. Site B fragmented on the x-axis has a white bar just above the first tick mark, a light gray bar halfway between the first and second tick marks, a dark gray bar halfway between the x-axis and the first tick mark, and a black bar above the first tick mark, higher than the white bar but lower than the light gray bar.\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/e4373e9e32e02bb860ad920a2b55e567/original.png\" width=\"365\" /></p>\n\n<p>The graph above shows how seed production in a plant species varied with population density in an unfragmented habitat (site A) and in a fragmented habitat (site B).
