The horizontal axis is labeled Temperature, in degrees Celsius, and the numbers negative 100 through 20, in increments of 20, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Altitude, in kilometers, and the numbers 0, 16, 48, 80, 100, 500, 1,000, and 3,500 are indicated. There graph is divided into four horizontal layers, labeled A, B, C, and D. Layer A ranges from 0 kilometers through 16 kilometers. Layer B ranges from 17 kilometers through approximately 45 kilometers. Layer C ranges from approximately 46 kilometers through 75 kilometers, and layer D ranges from approximately 47 kilometers through 3,500 kilometers. The data represented by the line are as follows. Note all values are approximate. The line begins at the point 20 degrees Celsius comma 0 kilometers and moves upward and to the left until reaching the point negative 58 degrees Celsius comma 15 kilometers. It then moves vertically upward until reaching point negative 58 degrees Celsius comma 17 kilometers, after which it moves upward and to the right until reaching the point negative 18 degrees Celsius comma 40 kilometers. The line then moves vertically upward until reaching the point negative 18 degrees comma 50 kilometers, and then moves upward and to the left until reaching the point negative 98 degrees Celsius comma 78 kilometers. The line then moves vertically upward until reaching the point negative 98 degrees Celsius comma 80 kilometers, after which it moves upward and to the right until reaching the point 20 degrees Celsius comma 3,500 kilometers and up.\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH929203.g01.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following correctly characterizes one of Earth’s atmospheric layers?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH929203_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Layer <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A\"><math alttext=\"A\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>A</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the stratosphere, where meteors are found.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Layer <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B\"><math alttext=\"B\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>B</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the troposphere, where weather occurs.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Layer <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C\"><math alttext=\"C\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is found.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Layer <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>D</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is the thermosphere, where auroras are found.</p>"],"answer":3}]
