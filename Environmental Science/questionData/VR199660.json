Four areas, labeled A through D, are also labeled on the map: location A is a city, location B is agricultural fields, location C is just downstream of a nuclear power plant, and location D is in the reservoir area behind a dam. The layout and flow of water across the map is as follows. A stream flows through location B, the agricultural fields, and feeds into a main river. Another stream flows through location A, the city, and also feeds into the main river.
