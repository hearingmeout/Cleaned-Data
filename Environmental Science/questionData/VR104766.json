A containment structure is shown with two components. The first component contains control rods and a reactor and the second unit is a steam generator. Water flows from the first component to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. Water also flows from the steam generator into another structure that contains a turbine and a condenser. The water flows downward through the turbine, past the condenser, back to the steam generator and continues in a circular fashion. The turbine is connected to an exterior generator, which is connected by powerline to a city. A cooling tower and a reservoir are also shown outside of the power plant. Water flows from the reservoir through the condenser, out to the cooking tower, and continues in a circular fashion.\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR104723.g06.png\" width=\"465\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Air pollutants that can lead to acid rain are released and move downwind.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Spent fuel rods are radioactive and must be disposed of properly.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Toxic metals are released into nearby reservoirs in the cooling water.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Intermittent weather patterns can lead to discontinuous generation of electricity</p>"],"answer":1}]
