A legend shows that both warm current and cold current are represented in the map. The flow of warm currents are as follows. Alaska, which curves northwest along the northwest coast of North America. Brazil, which curves slightly southeast along the eastern coast of South America. Gulf Stream which curves northeast along the eastern coast of North America. Norwegian, which flows to the northeast along the northern coast of Europe. The flow of cold currents are as follows. California, which flows southward off the western coast of North America. Peru, which curves northwest along the western coast of South America. Labrador, which curves southwest along the extreme northern and northeastern coasts of North America. Benguela, which curves northeast along the southeastern coast of Africa.
