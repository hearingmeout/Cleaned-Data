The vertical axis is labeled “Average Number of Plants Per 100 square meters,” and the numbers 0 through 350, in increments of 50, are indicated. A key shows that the three lines of data represent native grass, invasive grass, and total grass abundance. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line for native grass begins at the year 2000 with 180 plants and moves downwards and to the right, reaching the year 2002 with 155 plants, after which it moves gradually downwards and to the right and ends at the year 2012 with 100 plants. The line for invasive grass begins at the year 2000 with 155 plants and moves gradually upwards and to the right, intersecting the line for native grass at the year 2002. It continues gradually upwards and to the right, passing through the year 2006 with 180 plants and ends at the year 2012 with 200 plants. The line for total grass abundance remains high above the lines for native grass and invasive grass. It begins at the year 2000 with 340 plants and moves gradually downwards and to the right, passing through the year 2006 with 325 plants, and ends at the year 2012 with 300 plants.\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR107910.g03.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n</div>\n","rubricRef":"VR107910_rubric","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">Write your answers in the spaces provided.
