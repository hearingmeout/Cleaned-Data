The right vertical axis is labeled “Rainfall, in millimeters,” and the numbers 0 through 120, in increments of 20, are indicated. Each number on the horizontal axis has two bars associated with it. A key indicates that one bar represents sediment in runoff in nonvegetated areas, and that the other bar represents sediment in runoff in vegetated areas. The key indicates that the line graph represents “Rainfall.” The data, by number of days, are as follows. Note that all values are approximate.
