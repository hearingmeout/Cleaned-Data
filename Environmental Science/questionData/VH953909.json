The horizontal axis is labeled Time of the Day, in hours, and the times 4 A M through 3 P M, in increments of 2 hours, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Concentration, in parts per million, and the numbers 0 through 0.5, in increments of 0.1, are indicated. A key shows that four categories of data are included in the graph: line A, line B, line C, and line D. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Line A begins on the vertical axis above the origin at 0.05 parts per million, and curves upwards and to the right, reaching the time 6 A M comma 0.15 parts per million, and then curves downwards and to the right, reaching the time 10 A M comma 0.25 parts per million. It fluctuates slightly around that value, trending horizontally to the right until it ends after the time 3 P M. Line B begins on the vertical axis above the origin at 0.29 parts per million, and curves upwards and to the right, reaching the time 8 A M comma 0.45, after which it moves steeply downwards and to the right and ends at the time 1 P M comma 0.2 parts per million. Line C begins on the vertical axis above the origin at 0.25 parts per million and moves horizontally to the right until reaching the time 8 A M, after which it curves upwards and to the right, reaching the time 2 P M comma 0.2 parts per million. It then curves downwards and to the right, ending after 3 P M comma 0.1 parts per million. Line D begins on the vertical axis above the origin at 0.05 parts per million, and curves upwards and to the right at an increasing rate, reaching a peak at the time 8 A M comma 0.2 parts per million.
