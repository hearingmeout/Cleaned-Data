Ehrlich and Rodolfo Dirzo, both professors at Stanford University, … are using scientific data to back up their assertions that significant population decline and possible mass extinction of species all over the world may be imminent, and that both have been underestimated by many other scientists.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The study’s authors looked at reductions in a species’ range — a result of factors like habitat degradation, pollution and climate change, among others — and extrapolated from that how many populations have been lost or are in decline … .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">They found that about <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"30\"><math alttext=\"30\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>30</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> percent of all land vertebrates … are experiencing declines and local population losses.

Accelerating deforestation and rising carbon pollution are likely to make climate change worse, which could have disastrous consequences for the ability of many species to survive on earth.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Dr. Ceballos struck a slightly more hopeful tone, adding that some species have been able to rebound when some of these pressures are taken away. …</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">\"From The New York Times.
