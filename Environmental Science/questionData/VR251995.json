Each forest is described as follows. In Forest A, the population density of deer is high. White Oak, Eastern Hemlock, Lush grass, and Hayseed Fern are indicated. In Forest B, the population density of deer is medium. White Oak, Eastern Hemlock, Sugar Maple, American Holly Shrub, Lush grass, and Hayseed Fern are indicated.

The tops of the boulders have become covered with lichens, grasses, shrubs, and even some small trees. Deer can jump onto the top of shorter boulders to graze; however, none of the deer can jump onto the tallest boulders. Scientists sampled vegetation from the tops of these boulders, some of which were grazed by deer and some of which were not. Scientists observed that the most diverse plant growth occurred on the boulders that could not be reached by deer.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(g) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> the independent variable for the investigation.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR251995_rubric"},{"id":"VR251995","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:h part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"h\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(h) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify</span> one modification that could be made to the investigation that will alter the results and explain how it alters the results.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR251995_rubric"},{"id":"VR251995","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:i part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"i\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(i) The boulders studied in the investigation described above were deposited by a glacial retreat approximately 14,000 years ago. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> the steps that led to the establishment of the forest once soil formed in the study area.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR251995_rubric"},{"id":"VR251995","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:j part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"j\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(j) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> a natural occurrence that could require re-establishing a forest in an area with previously established soil.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR251995_rubric"}]
