The first method was spontaneous restoration, where the soil and rock were dumped in noncompacted, random piles and not replanted with vegetation. The second method was technical restoration, where the land was leveled by heavy machinery, organic material was added, and eight plant species were added. Technical restoration started <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"5\"><math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math></span></span> years after the piles were formed, so no bar is included in the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1 to 5\"><math alttext=\"1 to 5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>5</mn></math></span></span> year range in the graph.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Number of Plant Species in Spontaneous and Technically Restored Overburden Piles over Time</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a bar graph titled “Number of Plant Species in Spontaneous and Technically Restored Overburden Piles over Time.” The vertical axis is labeled “Average Number of Plant Species,” and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 10, are indicated. The horizontal axis is labeled “Age, in years, of Overburden Piles,” and the following six categories are indicated: 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 25, 26 to 35, and greater than 35. The 1 to 5 category has one bar, and all the other categories have two bars. A key indicates that one bar represents “Spontaneous restoration piles,” and the other bar represents “Technical restoration piles.” The data represented by the bars are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. 1 to 5 years. Spontaneous restoration piles, 6.3. Technical restoration piles, 0. 6 to 10 years. Spontaneous restoration piles, 12. Technical restoration piles, 10. 11 to 15 years. Spontaneous restoration piles, 13. Technical restoration piles, 11. 16 to 25 years. Spontaneous restoration piles, 12.7.
