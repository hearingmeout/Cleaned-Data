A key indicates that four categories of data are represented on the graph: Salmonella spp., E. coli, C. jejuni, and newly discovered bacterium. The horizontal axis is labeled Dose in C F U, or Colony Forming Units, and the numbers 10 to the power negative 2 through 10 to the power 6, in increments of integers of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Probability of Illness, and the numbers 0.0 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line for Salmonella spp. begins at the origin and moves horizontally until just before the point 10 to the power 0, and then curves steeply upwards and to the right, reaching the point 10 to the power 3 comma 0.9 probability of illness, after which the line begins to level off, ending at the point 10 to the power 6 comma 1.0 probability of illness. The line for E. coli begins at the origin and moves horizontally to the right until reaching the point 10 to the power 0, and then begins to curve steeply upwards and to the right at an increasing rate, ending at the point 10 to the power 6 comma 0.95 probability of illness. The line for C. jejuni begins near the origin and curves gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 10 to the power 6 comma 0.25 probability of illness. The line for newly discovered bacterium begins at the origin and curves upwards and to the right at an increasing rate, reaching the point 10 to the power 2 comma 0.5 probability of illness, and then leveling off and moving horizontally until reaching the point 10 to the power 6 on the horizontal axis.\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH954034.g04.png\" width=\"465\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If there are fewer than <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10 to the power 2\"><math alttext=\"10 to the power 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> colonies for all species in a drinking water sample, the water will be considered safe to drink.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. jejuni</span> is the only species of bacteria present in the drinking water sample, the water will be considered safe to drink at all doses.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">E. coli</span> and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Salmonella</span> <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"s p p\"><math alttext=\"s p p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>. would have the highest allowable dosage to meet the drinking water standards.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The newly discovered bacterium would have the lowest allowable dosage to meet the drinking water standards.</p>"],"answer":3}]
