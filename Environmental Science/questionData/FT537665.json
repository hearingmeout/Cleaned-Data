Each site was planted with a mix of tree seedlings to reclaim the area to forest. Grass was also seeded over each site to prevent initial erosion and to provide forage. Ten years after planting, information was collected at the five sites and is given in the table below. Select the letter of the row that indicates the site with the most successful forest reclamation.</p>\n&nbsp; <img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 5 columns and 5 rows. The columns are labeled, from left to right; column 1, Site Number; column 2, Percent Grass cover; column 3, Number of Tree Species Surviving; column 4, Percent Tree Cover; column 5, Average Height Increase of Seedlings (centimeters per year). The rows are labeled, from top to bottom; row 1, (A); row 2, (B); row 3, (C); row 4, (D); row 5, (E).
