There are 4 areas of the diagram labeled with the letters A, B, C, and D.  The flow of water and steam through the nuclear power plant is as follows. A containment structure surrounds an object labeled, A, that contains control rods and a reactor. Water is moved in a clockwise fashion through the structure that contains the control rods and reactor, and then through a steam generator in an endless cycle. A steam line moves from the steam generator into a structure labeled B. A pump moves water from the structure labeled B back into the generator, and that flow continues in an endless cycle. A structure labeled D moves water from an external reservoir into a condenser, which is below the structure labeled B, and then into the tower labeled C. Water from the tower labeled C can also flow back into the condenser, and arrows at the top of the tower labeled C indicate that omissions are passed into the atmosphere.\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH899609.g06.png\" width=\"525\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":0}]
