The original habitat shows 4 irregular polygons arranged roughly in two rows and two columns. Scenario 1 shows 4 irregular polygons in the same arrangement as the original habitat, and each polygon is the same shape as, but smaller than, its corresponding polygon in the original habitat. Scenario 2 shows 2 irregular polygons that are identical to the polygons in the upper left and lower right of the original habitat, but the polygons in the upper right and lower left of the original habitat are missing from scenario 2. Scenario 3 shows what looks like the same polygons in the same arrangement from the original habitat, but each polygon is bisected by a narrow strip cut through its central region.\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR024154.g04.png\" width=\"295\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increase in territory size of large mammals</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increase in genetic diversity of native species</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decrease in the number of specialist species</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decrease in the abundance of invasive species</p>"],"answer":2}]
