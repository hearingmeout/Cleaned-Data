Results: improved human health (must cite a specific problem such as hearing loss, less annoyance in high traffic areas), ecosystem disruption with specific example.\"></p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a student to use generic terms for their answer such as the following: air pollution, smog, exhaust emissions, depletion of fossil fuels, non-renewable resource, carbon emissions, or sulfur emissions.
