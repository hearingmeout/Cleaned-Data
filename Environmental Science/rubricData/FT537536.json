Increased removal of medium and large trees will: allow understory to develop into larger trees, potentially enhancing forest habitat, make additional timber available to use (must indicate usage), result in thinned trees resistant to pests and disease or impede spread of disease and pests, enhance economic value of the surrounding areas (housing, lower insurance), lower the cost of timber, result in a change of aesthetics (with explanation), Negative Effect and Description: The removal of medium and large trees or small tree brush removal will, reduce available habitat for other organisms in the forest biome, allow timber companies to cut in areas remote from forest communities not threatened by forest fires, cause a reduction in biodiversity (must include a specific example: reduction in nest sites, decrease in seed trees, etc.), increase soil erosion, increase logging practices (e.g., roads providing access to new areas), reduce public input, result in a change in aesthetics (with explanation).\"></p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points"],"values":[0,1,2],"maxScores":[2,2,2],"descriptions":["<p>Student response does not include any of the following:</p><p>(Two points can be earned: 1 point for a correct positive effect and description; 1 point for a correct negative effect and description.)</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/c1557a87edb61101c3b2609d2ab13ecb/original.png?Signature=kVezZ3m40xe1Asjg9qjcV%2FLMwAs%3D&amp;Expires=1628272401&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKRV5O7MFX&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQDxamn0iEYPkZnD%2BCF50NZSiFRVzqV6TZJ7Kzj3f5lRhAIhAK6w9N2lAKA%2BlOj4D3t51M510M//R1ciegZM%2Bj/S6N35KvoDCFoQAhoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1Igxp014JeemG6pYOceQq1wMnBNQpS96RJPFXeE7SNdsKV7lC0B4DFP6TvDskygdK1pPhOH5f%2Bf0h8O2ApIET/i7gaGtIp0q8uY7S6GlAAXtG%2BAJuIXdPRYJbihMQ9%2BD2BBhxw6jkEjjxtRhmtAIS0XCfcs8ddoubKetArpS6WNXIENB7UpEcvB3u/wLhHT%2BDqLyH/8yx0X9sLSLkvl83wGh42lsb/Cn/%2BIeHVFyDgD3y8x/MzGZkk8rtOX9PMcteDb4HKQ9RZEbRqW80BKAYCsUm9eq7qHOwovQPZc2GMsrxMqzpHY1i3hXyJl67Zbbvp0SuD2cQXfoYyFsAB6e9KaGninkMlJm94a6HdXzcvoqxRTK6hQWXsrEBpgS%2Bf/9aWRkaHyQO1S2q87c4xGM6u/ZkUCqzbVg/PBLmDZWfXROFf7C%2BW3zJU1pFNNCCDBRwgvqzY1e9DaZdfVHcvbpluI5jT6W6v6fUPf/XrdN1djeGqqVnrPX3uPZBgf2M3UqsnjNrMnj9oUpwiUujruZUYMYLDbKjpQAh79KiTkI0EoieKH6RDfR1k2Nzy765z4Zts3ci439mIpIyrAMleUErK0EeyLS1Y1qm8qontx0ysPzdveWUvFQKlrZzN7QeMMTLg9mOZAc2zsYwv%2BiziAY6pAEvB6TFNntEzt8uo%2BIzfj43AyWqjuWKdOmF3RJnJHv2Dd5ba/8s%2BruCb%2Bbr4TN3N9k6VAqs8ueXEHTjCHXL6ia7jwb/7Uz1swoLZkdKJr0QBNw21jN3B5a2IhN%2BpX5ueleJ%2BSrNi%2BJ4T8KBOnvHR2e8egNhZ7hdKDCki7Hfri6LMPQK5KQ6lmuuJf4W60NApR13uwmS1QU9TsckgPm%2B5d6PN18%2BAg%3D%3D\" title=\"\" alt=\"The table has two columns and one row.
