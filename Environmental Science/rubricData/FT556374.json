Description: Increased water volume in areas of diversion projects can suspend pollutants that were held within the soil prior to the increased water volume. Discussion: Identification of a specific example, e.g. mercury with the James Bay Project.  8. Description: Invasion of exotic/alien species as a result of water diversion. Discussion: Competition/elimination of native species. 9. Description: Increased water volume resulting in saturation (waterlogging) of soils. Discussion: Lack of oxygen in soil for plant growth.\"></p>"]},{"id":"FT556374_rubric_category_1","type":"custom","title":"Part B ","stimulusHtml":"<p><strong>4 points maximum</strong><br><br>1 point earned for the argument and 1 point for additional support of the argument.

From left to right the columns are labeled &quot;Urban Consumption and Natural Areas&quot;. The table entries are as follows. 1. Urban Consumption: Urban areas need water diverted for domestic uses such as washing clothes, bathing, washing dishes, cooking, drinking water, etc. Natural Areas: Natural areas need water for plant functions: green plants provide natural air filtration and carbon dioxide uptake, plus they provide other benefits, such as cooling. 2. Urban Consumption: Industrial uses such as in cooling power plants, in paper production, etc. Natural Areas: Wetland areas filter water, removing potential water pollutants, such as excess nitrates, phosphates.  3. Urban Consumption: Economic impact due to loss of jobs and the inability of industries to function without water, causing economic hardship. 4. Urban Consumption: Health: Clean ample water supplies are necessary to prevent spread of disease, maintain hygiene, etc. Natural Areas: Recharge of groundwater supplies surface water as a component of the hydrologic cycle. 5. Urban Consumption: Agriculture: though agricultural areas are not urban, a significant portion of the world’s people (approximately 50 percent), live in urban areas and depend on/consume water indirectly by relying on the productivity of the agricultural lands. Natural Areas: Sustaining food chains, providing habitat, maintaining biodiversity of organisms that have important roles in nutrient cycles, etc. 6. Urban Consumption: Keeping the cost affordable- if water was not diverted, the cost would increase and be too costly for some people (Poorer hygiene and increase in diseases). Natural Areas: Conservation: with more efficient use of water in urban areas, enough water would be available for urban consumption and be allowed to flow to natural areas. 7. Urban Consumption: Since approximately one-half of the world’s population live in urban areas, urban diversion for water consumption is necessary. Natural Areas: Maintaining natural areas for their aesthetic value and recreational purposes. 8. Urban Consumption: Maintaining nature within urban areas for aesthetic value and ecological services that plants provide. Natural Areas: Prevention of continued urban and suburban sprawl 9. Urban Consumption: Ethical/moral justifications for the survival of people. Natural Areas: Ethical/moral justifications for survival of species in natural areas.\"></p>"]},{"id":"FT556374_rubric_category_2","type":"custom","title":"Part C","stimulusHtml":"<p><strong>3 points maximum</strong><br><br>1 point is earned by identifying another water diversion project. 1 point is earned for each environmental problem that might result from the project (maximum of two points).

Since the question wording (“other than the Colorado River”) might direct the student to focus on the name of a specific river and state their answer such as, “the damming of the Nile River”, this type of response earns the identification point.<br></p><p>The two environmental problems discussed must be applicable to the identified water diversion project, and only the <strong>first two</strong> problems discussed are scored.<br></p><p>Water Diversion Projects (some examples are shown below; although this is not a comprehensive list):</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/ad9d0031f53f35da14498722674ffe7a/original.png?Signature=YJn4ztvZYHGFIlLJ77dlgBRoQCM%3D&amp;Expires=1628461533&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKWQ2BFCHC&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQDwTL4rYQyQJOuDmCTjnYFCc5OA9UYwiGn4El3AcPRnDgIhAL57VHnB2Ry3Aby1wecfovBGxsoi6/NfbrSW%2B7afgw8sKoMECI7//////////wEQAhoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1IgwA6OvBpnJ%2B1AU6VB0q1wOzX4uHUN3YJJssRjDOHBU/sJSM3B6rrgpzFCyr6Z1w96VYw0fdi1cSm4AQDEIChZRsUjfbnS45Ne9LYry/hT4R48uSgVO%2BzBx9h7u0FK9zmnVy3uhODlpMMwP8ufVmTY8NbcYgb2o0jeUtJuYqldPjf4oqZ0hFqQFnzJvMejkyel/%2BcHoamJrnDyUfpangR7qX8VQxBCKL1lWGHAzRPe/q9%2B9GXH5NRaP56n8R9aEgdcpKg6/TnAdYFUkaS1qavEJwM5lh09FR2zxf%2BY3KTuJkYd%2BIXdKL7lIiqtznoJolvY26t/W4C3klkfSfLO1CiuliDKdkD1FbTFPbFZaf82qYMnId7SjkSFAvN4MumqkFx94UJK%2B9bMcQN8M/KNT0gRTQgCRbGnR4kyUHd4pHtb/C%2BzwB3im00KkFiHDd8CvKAzmOczue2HC%2BgTqSVrk%2BBMa%2BXGxjpMGQzT%2B%2BoZfs4jpezOxshM9CscHqaNjxdsOS/MCGLXuM5HtQKDPDH9L6PjRSCxLrGT5TNgAqD/VDMVIx14jKH1gNPuJbHQ212t5tRAGAugXM289uBmMsz0zEJlygD7U4wZQm4nc%2Bvi6qr5EHnk16Q7PleqJ2BLeT1Ts69ojL5QipVLIw7a%2B/iAY6pAH6oA0cVNtiHtRqu1qgckGXh9YX585rPB9EC75nkk%2BW/p9v5F3iN8i7Yt97iaPoiv/a05um6dPTtRJf5SP8EvhG92QoWaO4ZH1PrQpmzjXUBBgpicQkUEgDpq/m%2BH8FeZSW7C7PGvhaOS/6wu9ebDfxPyMLrTesdxQzRYGo41OcTJK08IomtrZ4Gk1kTIjBAiPLU6MakqoDPukvKvxLMYLs7FsaJg%3D%3D\" alt=\"The table has two columns and 16 rows.
