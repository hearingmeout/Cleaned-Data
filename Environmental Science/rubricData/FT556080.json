From left to right the columns are labeled &quot;Method, description of practice, and contribution to depletion&quot;. The table entries are as follows.  1. Method: Bottom trawling. Description of practice: Drag a net along ocean bottom or drag a line with books along bottom. Contribution to depletion: Catches many nontarget species star (bycatch). 2. Method: Long-line fishing. Description of practice: Fishing line with many books, extending for long distances and allowed to drift (&quot;towed&quot; not credited). Contribution to depletion: Catches many nontarget species (bycatch), ghost fishing (continue to catch even when untended).  3. Method: Nets, drift nets/Gill nets, or purse seines. Description of practice: Large nets stretching for miles and set out and allowed to drift (&quot;towed&quot; not credited), Large nets are drawn up like a drawstring purse to capture fish in large schools near the ocean surface (&quot;towed&quot; not credited). Contribution to depletion: Mesh size may selectively deplete certain size/age class, catches many nontarget species (bycatch), ghost fishing (continue to catch in untended net), Catches large quantities of fish (whole schools), catches many nontarget species (bycatch).  4. Method: Sonar. Description of practice: Sound waves used to locate fish or to see the bottom.
