Possible Characteristic: (Increased combustion) due to large numbers of: automobiles, burning garbage, factories, airplanes, or other urban machinery. Possible Description: Increased temperature along with ozone precursors (e.g., NOx, VOCs) increase ground level ozone, Increase in particulates (ash or soot) from incomplete combustion, Nitrogen oxides react with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide (a foul-smelling brown gas). Also may combine with water vapor and other pollutants to produce smog, Other pollutants include sulfur oxides, lead, CO, and NOx. 2. Possible Characteristic: Industrial processes. Possible Description: Petroleum refineries produce hydrocarbon and particulates, The volatile fumes from dry cleaners contribute to photochemical smog, Bakeries and dry cleaners release hydrocarbons, which are converted with sunlight and other gasses to form ozone.  3. Possible Characteristic: Urban development. Possible Description: Increase in particulates from exposed soil. 4. Possible Characteristic: Tall buildings. Possible Description: Trap pollutions or limit airflow, which will limit diffusion of pollutions. 5. Possible Characteristic : Less vegetation.
