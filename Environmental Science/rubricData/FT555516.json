From left to right the columns are labeled as “Economic service and Benefit”. The entries in the table are as follows: 1. Ecosystem service: Control of pests with natural predators, Benefits: Reduces incidence of disease (vector-borne), Reduces need for pesticides, and Reduced crop losses. 2. Ecosystem service: Waste disposal/treatment, Benefits: Decomposition reduces amount of waste, Recycles nutrients (plant growth), Detoxification, and removal of pollutants. 3. Ecosystem service: Filtering/purification of water by soils and plants, Benefits: Reduces costs of providing safe drinking water and Less contamination/fewer waterborne diseases. 4. Ecosystem service: Storage and regulation of water supplies (water cycle), Benefits: Reduces costs of creating fresh water (reverse osmosis), Supports growth of agricultural crops, Allows transport of goods, Allows manufacturing of goods, and Water is necessary for survival. 5. Ecosystem service: Disposal/dilution of fecal waste, Benefits: Reduced incidence of disease and Reduced cost of sewage treatment. 6. Ecosystem service: Cycling of nutrients (such as nitrogen/phosphorus), Benefits: Reduces use of inorganic/synthetic fertilizers and Recycles nutrients (plant growth). 7. Ecosystem service: Release of oxygen by plants (oxygen cycle), Benefits: Necessary for human survival. 8. Prevention of soil erosion (roots), Benefits: Reduces costs of soil amendment/fertilizer. 9. Ecosystem service: Flood control and moderation of the effects of severe storms (storm surges) through absorption of water, Benefits: Protection of human lives and Lower cost for loss of human property. 10. Ecosystem service: Lumber/timber, Benefits: Building, fuel, paper products, Provides income for loggers, paper industry, and Difficult or expensive to replace/duplicate (synthetics often use petrochemicals). 11. Ecosystem service: Cycling of carbon, Benefits: Vital to crop growth and Helps in moderation of global temperature. 12. Ecosystem service: Medicines to treat diseases, Benefits: Provides income to harvesters and Improves quality of human life (e.g. cancer and diabetes drugs). 13. Ecosystem service: Genes for resistance to pathogens and crop pests, Benefits: Reduces costs of pesticides and Reduces use of fossil fuels. 14. Ecosystem service: Fish, game, fruit, nuts, Benefits: Source of food for hunters, gatherers, and fishers. 15. Ecosystem service: Soil formation, maintenance of soil nutrients, Benefits: Reduces costs of fertilizer/soil amendment.\"></p>"]}]
