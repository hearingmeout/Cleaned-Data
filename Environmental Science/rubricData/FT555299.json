The activity of dredging/ditching; it removes sediment from the ecosystem; increases erosion, increases sediment load to river.  10. The activity of draining of wetlands; it increases erosion sue to increased overland flow, increases sediment load to river; decreases sediment trapping because of vegetation loss, increases sediment load to river.  11. The activity of overgrazing rangelands; it increases erosion, increases sediment load to river.  12. The activity of mining(strip mining) ; it increases erosion, increases sediment load to river.\"></p>"]},{"id":"FT555299_rubric_category_1","type":"custom","title":"Part B ","stimulusHtml":"<p><strong>2 points maximum</strong><br><br>1 point for each description [must be ecological, not economic];
