Grid-connected: Pros: There is a back-up energy source in case the home system does not provide enough, Less area is needed for system compared to stand-alone systems, Battery system is unnecessary, Surplus energy can be sold back to the local power company, System can be smaller than stand-alone since the grid can supply energy at peak usage times, Altruistic argument: Excess energy sold back to the utility decreases the need for consumption of other natural resources. Cons: Net-metering hardware (grid exchange system) may be expensive, No battery back-up in case of power grid failure, Utility may require a large system for net-metering capability. 2.

General Type: Building Design Elements: Action: Use of Thermal Mass Devices (TMDs) such as stone or concrete floors and walls, Trombe walls, interior water reservoirs, etc., Energy Cost Benefits: Thermal mass devices store thermal energy during the day and release it at night. This reduces costs associated with heating. 7. General Type: Building Design Elements: Action: Installation of a solar chimney, Energy Cost Benefits: Helps improve ventilation in the house and reduce cooling costs. 8. General Type: Building Design Elements: Action: Installation of a roof pond, Energy Cost Benefits: Promotes evaporative cooling, reducing cooling costs during the summer. 9.

From left to right, the columns are labeled General Type, Action, and Energy Cost Benefits. The column entries are as follows: 1. General Type: Solar Obstruction Systems (SOSs)-Any device that prevents or reflects solar radiation from entering the dwelling: Action: Plant trees/shrubs around dwelling (or &quot;on&quot; in the case of rooftop gardens), Energy Cost Benefit: In temperate zones, deciduous trees in the winter will not have leaves so sunlight can shine into the house, warming it. In the summer, the trees will have leaves and will shade the house from sunlight, keeping it cooler. In both seasons, the trees will help keep the heating and cooling costs down, In sub-tropical zones, trees and shrubs block solar radiation from reaching the house resulting in lower cooling costs year round. 2. General Type: Solar Obstruction Systems (SOSs)-Any device that prevents or reflects solar radiation from entering the dwelling: Action: Reflective roof or wall materials, Energy Cost Benefit: Decreases cooling costs. 3. General Type: Solar Obstruction Systems (SOSs)-Any device that prevents or reflects solar radiation from entering the dwelling: Action: Window treatments (reflective or blocking), Energy Cost Benefit: Decreases cooling costs. 4. General Type: Solar Obstruction Systems (SOSs)-Any device that prevents or reflects solar radiation from entering the dwelling: Action: Build a berm around the house blocking sunlight, Energy Cost Benefit: Decreases cooling costs. 5. General Type: Solar Obstruction Systems (SOSs)-Any device that prevents or reflects solar radiation from entering the dwelling: Action: Increase insulation in walls and/or use super-insulated windows, Energy Cost Benefit: Insulated walls and/or windows prevent transfer of heat into the house in the summer, thus reducing cooling costs.\"></p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/ea45c6f9b6a705e17580cc83f47d34e6/original.png?Signature=2HNuM9YU1L6k9hK%2FRJH2QmhbBuw%3D&amp;Expires=1628426537&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKUHZ4YKES&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEGwaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDkezDK3KlvGfnZKm3QGOsDnwCQlLs3mik0yKTNLBJAbgIgK5vkfXWlL2kmvfx0y1FjlZnD8T8PfGKxuLHlLQKmxbMqgwQIhf//////////ARACGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDNheV3fY3mNAAhRQxSrXA6NJpPPMlm99dk0YwiXxHTXZXnwtbwghSgHqJiMm6qMJ/Idp2LyywW%2BxjtESPjtUMYzSruzGFf1CkfT9prK%2BZUkY1H%2BJ7wLiOBaaTb7o2z21UD4pYhtmCrZBcq3j1Uztq7meH%2B4HcRxJ6CspYneu0TLGtArbZm958N55K6kMaiMDWXFO%2BUxMfS9VzI6Kg/xZ6XQpmD/vDH5TPWVOapbehPWeywSWw0NFK2OJRTWwyFhEvY%2BjkgImbkK9tE28ophIeah2TLp3mkRXEZXx1RTmbYHbnvLMolZ2FAn3nkOjTWvAOvh7j/fBm47WYj95RPRfwhZCAVCZdC/gFjtTkmdcDnrvU/X0GJdZj1yiGVWP4kUhHzkZcVnY4m11QTcjPYTM5qeBWpqe9j2q96Zh7IOoWowD%2Bmgj09ZTd4LvGzo1WMwP%2BsggM6Ap8yPainlfVdsmrzb2kGNwQ2nYEgYaPBWw%2BZZlbiTt/LeJRBUIZVAteSxYQMFXo4cmDEYshYiEH2PlK/t3lXzqp2pSwzy%2Bkc9ipHtNgIKNzBdKEHt0N%2BaOAnGKMtCoZR7yflk0z7Ho3q/HjIhtxeslbM2gwsGSviiSendN7AJPXh2sdtsGR0U140RkOZgN/q4LvTDgor2IBjqlAb8QRx9LehDR6ZoWxM8oOdXHXfmUMQ8TbNGliTQK/l1VM3oRW1diCfkA3EKDoJQ5Ms6f85MxS1QTGVIrUN0L2Bkbei4T95o4k%2BFtKBlLAPRzXqnfDj07BJAmTm0OMJNbTp5qZwtBg0OE3SdkFk/t1dol1OIUajE4fesl2FKdxIYs72qIkc6f5BLD%2B2V7xmNpqqfq5f/LEDTTPPWWXR/v%2BlDx3MBtdw%3D%3D\" alt=\"The table has three columns and ten rows.
