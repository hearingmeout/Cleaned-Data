The IMF recognized that many reforms would take years to complete, especially the construction of the legal infrastructure for a market economy, privatization and restructuring of large enterprises, and the creation of a market system for banking and finance. But this was not seen as a reason for postponing the main stabilization and liberalization measures, with some specific exceptions, such as gradually rather than suddenly raising the prices of public utilities and housing rents and reducing export taxes on energy and other basic imports. Thus IMF views were similar to those of Russian reformers and many foreign observers.

In the post-Tiananmen period, the CCP has gradually repositioned itself as a “governing party” responding to social demands instead of a “ruling party” reshaping social demands. Former party general secretary Jiang Zemin’s dramatic rewardrobing of the CCP from a transformative party representing the proletariat into a populist party representing “the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people” in his Theory of the Three Represents (announced in 2001 and incorporated into the Party constitution in 2002) reflects the CCP’s recognition that its survival today depends mainly on whether it is legitimate. When Khrushchev declared that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) would become a “party of all the people” in 1961, it was stridently denounced by the CCP as revisionist, “a massive backward step” in the words of the official critique. Forty years later, theorists in China admit that this is exactly what the CCP has done with the Three Represents.

It bared important schisms within the .·.·. political system and pitted two key camps against one another, each with a very different vision of what Iran should be and what it should become. It appeared to solidify . . . under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and continued an ongoing militarization of Iranian politics led by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. . . . The widespread fraud alleged by the leading opposition candidate, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, and the .·.·. (political system’s) repressive response irrevocably shattered an unspoken contract between the government and the people—one in which the theocratic government had allowed some popular political participation and limited personal space in return for the people’s acquiescence to the status quo.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Even the highest authority in Iran, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not escape censure by the opposition—a traditional “red line” in Iranian politics that clerics, politicians, and voters alike crossed numerous times after the polls closed. Previously, Khamenei had portrayed himself as above the often-brutal factional “fray” in Iran. But now he came down decisively on the side of Ahmadinejad and his hard-line allies and used the Revolutionary Guard to preserve the status quo. In so doing, he altered the role of the office he occupied.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: Alireza Nader, David E. Thaler, and S.R.

Note that all values are approximate. The line graph representing the United Kingdom begins at 78% in 1960 and continues relatively horizontally to the right until it reaches 80% in 2005. From here, it moves gradually upward and to the right until it ends at 84% in 2018.

The numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 20, are indicated on the vertical axis. A key indicates that the line graphs represent data for the following four countries: China, Mexico, the U K, and Russia. The data represented by the line graphs are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line graph representing China begins at 62 in 2015 and moves upward and to the right until it reaches 82 in 2016. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches 62 in 2017. From here, it moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches 79 in 2019, and then moves gradually downward until it ends at 72 in 2021. The line graph representing Mexico begins at 50 in 2015 and moves upward and to the right until it reaches 70 in 2016. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches 50 in 2017. From here, it moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches 58 in 2019. It then moves relatively horizontally to the right until it ends at 59 in 2021. The line graph representing the U K begins at 39 in 2015 and moves upward and to the right until it reaches 57 in 2016. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches 38 in 2017. From here, it moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches 44 in 2019. It moves gradually downward and to the right until it reaches 39 in 2020, then moves gradually upward and to the right until it ends at 46 in 2021. The line graph representing Russia begins at 40 in 2015 and moves relatively horizontally to the right until it reaches 42 in 2016. It then moves gradually downward and to the right until it reaches 32 in 2017. From here it moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches 27 in 2018.
