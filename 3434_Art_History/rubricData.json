Socrates.</p><p></p><p><strong>Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheater)</strong></p><p>· The vast size of the Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheater) is meant to symbolize the vastness and power of the Roman Empire, which at its height controlled large parts of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region.</p><p>· The orderly and efficient design allowed for optimal crowd control and the comfort of the spectators.</p><p>· The design of the aesthetically pleasing exterior also signaled the wealth, power, and order of the Roman civilization and its government: in other words, the significance of the people of Rome.</p><p>· Social distinctions were emphasized through an architectural organization that separated the classes so that the most important citizens were placed closest to the arena (such as the emperor, priests, and citizens who held high offices), whereas the higher areas were reserved for those deemed less important (such as women, slaves, and foreigners), thereby reinforcing Roman ideas of social order.</p><p>· In building such a splendid structure as a gift for the people of the city of Rome and providing free, elaborate entertainment for all inhabitants of Rome, the Flavian emperors demonstrated that they were the friends and caretakers of the Roman populace as a whole.</p><p></p><p><strong>Forum of Trajan</strong></p><p>· The sculptural imagery found throughout the forum emphasizes Roman militarism and communicates Trajan’s military success against the Dacians.</p><p>· The massive basilica exalts the emperor by bearing his family name and placing him at the center of the justice meted out by the court of law located within.</p><p>· The inclusion of libraries expresses that Trajan is a man of learning in addition to being a successful military leader.</p><p>· Pervasive use of imported marble and gilded statues gives a sense of elegance to the forum, suggesting Trajan’s elevated status.</p><p>· Placement of the forum next to the fora of earlier emperors places Trajan’s success and accomplishments on an imperial continuum.</p><p>· The inclusion of a temple or shrine to the deified Trajan after his death shows the status of the emperor in the Roman state and the importance that was given to a “good” emperor.</p>"}]},"VH911003_rubric_category_4":{"id":"VH911003_rubric_category_4","t":"custom","ti":"PART E: COMPLEXITY","s":"<p>A

agora</strong></p><p>· The ancient Athenian understanding of democracy was different from our modern understanding: although the agora reinforced ideals of participatory government, only a small percentage of the ancient Athenian population (e.g., male citizens) had the right to participate in the democratic process.</p><p>· Although the agora also contained a few temples (such as the Hephaisteion, which stood on a hill on the west side of the agora), its function was centered on secular matters of the city-state.</p><p>· Although the agora was originally a marketplace, buildings for administrative and government use were gradually added over time, as the political system of the city-state of Athens developed and changed (for example, actual Athenian democracy was relatively short-lived, but the agora was used over many centuries as a center for civic life).</p><p></p><p><strong>Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheater)</strong></p><p>· The often-bloody entertainments that took place in the Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheater)—and which included exotic animals as well as theatrically staged executions of convicted criminals—may have demonstrated the power of the Roman Empire, but the entertainments also illustrated Rome’s brutality at this time.</p><p>· The seating that emphasized social distinctions marginalized certain members of the Roman Empire, such as women and slaves, showing that Rome’s power included the ability to elevate or lower the status of certain groups.</p><p>· The Flavian emperors chose land for the site that had been annexed by the previous emperor, Nero, for his private use. In returning the land to the Roman people and making it a public space, the Flavians were aligning themselves with the Romans they ruled, arguably positioning themselves as precursors to the five “good” emperors.</p><p></p><p><strong>Forum of Trajan</strong></p><p>· The building of imperial fora was in some ways a competitive endeavor, with each emperor trying to outshine his predecessors to show that he was the most powerful of the Roman emperors. The Forum of Trajan was the final and last of these imperial fora and can be interpreted as an effort on the part of Trajan to show that he was greater and more powerful than earlier emperors Caesar, Augustus, and Vespasian, whose fora are located nearby.</p><p>· The design of the Forum of Trajan is connected to the tradition of erecting triumphal monuments and holding victory ceremonies to celebrate Roman military leaders who had achieved an important victory, otherwise called a “triumph.” In the time of the Roman Empire, these monuments and ceremonies were political statements that celebrated the person of the emperor as well as the greatness of the Roman Empire and Roman civilization as a whole.</p><p>· The Senate decided after Emperor Trajan’s death to place the emperor’s ashes inside the base of the Column of Trajan in the forum, showing how important the Senate believed his military accomplishments were to both his rule and his legacy after death.</p>"}]},"VH911019_rubric_category_0":{"id":"VH911019_rubric_category_0","t":"custom","ti":"Task 1: Describe form, style, materials, technique, or content.","s":"<p>Select a point value to view scoring criteria, solutions, and/or examples and to score the response.

therefore, illuminated Christian codices such as gospels became important parts of artistic production in the British Isles in connection with the spread of Christianity from the European continent.</p><p>· Christianity was a new religion in the British Isles around 700 C.E./when this work is created; the style reflects the search for new artistic expressions that were fitting for the new faith and that also connected with established traditions accessible to the local population.</p><p>· The combination of iconic with aniconic imagery and the stylized depiction of the evangelist Luke can also be interpreted as a reaction to debates within the Christian community at the time about the dangers of religious images used for worship/dangers of idolatry.</p><p>· The integration of elements from other traditions originated from the cultural exchange between leaders of early Christian communities in the British Isles and mainland Europe/Rome; these monastery leaders traveled to Rome and other areas that brought them in contact with Byzantine/Roman artistic traditions.</p><p>· Elaborate codices such as Lindisfarne gospels played a role in missionizing/converting local populations to Christianity; the merging of local artistic traditions with contemporaneous Byzantine/Christian manuscript traditions can be seen in this context.</p>"}]},"VR217486_rubric_category_0":{"id":"VR217486_rubric_category_0","t":"custom","ti":"Task 1: Explain how a work demonstrates continuity within an artistic tradition, style, or practice.","s":"<p>Select a point value to view scoring criteria, solutions, and/or examples and to score the response.
