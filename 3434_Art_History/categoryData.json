Similarities within Central Andean cultures can be traced to the influence of three significantly distinct ecosystems in close proximity-the dominant Andes mountains, a narrow desert coast, and the planet's largest rain forest (the Amazon). These environments necessarily play a central role in art, influencing the materials (especially the prominence of camelid fiber and cotton textiles), political systems (coastal diversity, highland impulses toward unification), and overall values (reciprocity, asymmetrical dualism, and travel across long distances).
