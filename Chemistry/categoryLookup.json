Because intermolecular interactions are overcome completely when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions.

They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted (i.e., in a molten state) or dissolved in water or another solvent.","403264":"3.2.A.4: In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a three- dimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite). These are only formed from nonmetals and metalloids: elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily.","403265":"3.2.A.5: Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers.","403266":"3.2.A.6: Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting.","403267":"3.2.A.7: In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule.

The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together.","403271":"3.3.A.2: The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles.","403272":"3.3.A.3: The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times.","403273":"3.3.A.4: In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion.
