The horizontal axis is labeled “Molecular Speed, in meters per second,” and the numbers 0 to 2500, in increments of 500, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Fraction of Molecules” and no values are indicated on the axis. Curve 1 begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and to the right until it reaches a peak at a molecular speed of about 300 meters per second, about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off as it reaches the horizontal axis at a molecular speed of about 1000 meters per second. Curve 2 begins at the origin and moves slightly less steeply upward and to the right until it reaches a peak at a molecular speed of about 400 meters per second, about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off as it reaches the horizontal axis at a molecular speed of 1200 meters per second. Curve 3 begins at the origin and moves steadily upward and to the right until it reaches a peak at a molecular speed of about 500 meters per second, about half of the way up the vertical axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off and reaches the horizontal axis at a molecular speed of about 1500 meters per second. Curve 4 begins at the origin and moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches a peak at a molecular speed of about 1100 meters per second, about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it levels off and ends at a molecular speed of about 2500 meters per second, just above the horizontal axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR843809.g05.svg\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2\"><math alttext=\"2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"3\"><math alttext=\"3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>3</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"4\"><math alttext=\"4\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":2}]
