It continues steeply downward and to the right until it ends slightly above the horizontal axis. The second curve is labeled “Gas Z.” The curve begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and to the right, but below the Gas X curve at first, then crossing the Gas X curve. The Gas Z curve then begins to curve downward approximately one half of the way along the horizontal axis, staying above the Gas X curve, continuing steeply downward and to the right until it ends slightly above the horizontal axis and to the right of the Gas X curve.
