The heading for column 1 is “Compound.” The heading for column 2 is “Structure.” The heading for column 3 is “Boiling Point, in degrees Celsius.” The data in the table are as follows. Row 1. Compound: Methanol. Structure: A C atom is connected to 3 H atoms and 1 O atom, each by a single bond. The O atom has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. The O atom is connected to an H atom by a single bond. Boiling Point: 65 degrees Celsius. Row 2. Compound: Ethanol. Structure: 1 C atom is connected to 3 H atoms and 1 C atom, each by a single bond. The second C atom is connected to 2 H atoms and 1 O atom, each by a single bond. The O atom has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. The O atom is connected to 1 H atom by a single bond. Boiling Point: 78 degrees Celsius. Row 3. Compound: Propanal. Structure: 1 C atom is connected to 3 H atoms and 1 C atom, each by a single bond. The second C atom is connected to 2 H atoms and 1 additional C atom, each by a single bond. The C atom is connected to 1 O atom by a double bond and 1 H atom by a single bond. The O atom has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. Boiling Point: 49 degrees Celsius. Row 4. Compound: Hexane. Structure: 6 C atoms are arranged in a horizontal row, each connected by a single bond. The leftmost and rightmost C atoms are each connected to 3 H atoms by single bonds. The middle 4 C atoms are each connected to 2 H atoms by single bonds.
