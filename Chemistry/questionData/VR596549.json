The horizontal axis is labeled “Molecular Speed,” and the vertical axis is labeled “Fraction of Molecules.” The curve labeled X begins at the origin and moves steeply upward and slightly to the right until it reaches a peak near the top of the vertical axis, about one fifth of the way along the horizontal axis. It then moves steeply downward and to the right initially. As it approaches the horizontal axis, the curve begins to level off at about one half of the horizontal axis and then ends just above, and approximately three fourths of the way along the horizontal axis. The curve labeled O 2, gas, also begins at the origin, and moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches a peak about halfway up the vertical axis, and about halfway along the horizontal axis. It then moves gradually downward and to the right, becoming level as it approaches the horizontal axis, and ends just above the end of the horizontal axis. The peak for the curve labeled O 2, gas, is lower and to the right of the peak for the curve labeled X.\" height=\"286\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR596549.g03.svg\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"300 kelvin\"><math alttext=\"300 kelvin\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>300</mn><mspace width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">K</mi></math></span></span> shown above, which of the following gases could be represented by curve <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"X \"><math alttext=\"X \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math></span></span>?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR596549_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"B r 2, gas\"><math alttext=\"B r 2, gas\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>Br</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mi>g</mi></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C H 4, gas\"><math alttext=\"C H 4, gas\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>CH</mi><mn>4</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mi>g</mi></mpadded><mo>)</mo></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"H e, gas\"><math alttext=\"H e, gas\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>He</mi><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mi>g</mi></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"N 2, gas\"><math alttext=\"N 2, gas\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mpadded><mo>(</mo><mpadded><mi>g</mi></mpadded><mo>)</mo></mpadded></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":0}]
