The horizontal axis is labeled “Binding Energy, in megajoules per mole,” and the numbers, 1000, 100, 10, 1, and 0.1 are indicated from left to right at equal intervals. The vertical axis is labeled “Relative Number of Electrons.” The spectrum shows four different peaks at the following locations, from left to right. Peak 1 is at 100 megajoules per mole. Peak 2 is at 8 megajoules per mole. Peak 3 is at 5 megajoules per mole. Peak 4 is at 0.7 megajoules per mole. Peak 1 and Peak 2 are the same height. The height of Peak 3 is three times that of Peak 1 and Peak 2.
