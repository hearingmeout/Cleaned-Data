Each container has a pinhole opening. Which of the gases, He(<em>g</em>) or Ne(<em>g</em>), will escape faster through the pinhole and why? </p>","choicesHtml":["He(<em>g</em>) will escape faster because the He(<em>g</em>) atoms are moving at a higher average speed than the Ne(<em>g</em>) atoms.","Ne(<em>g</em>) will escape faster because its initial pressure in the container is higher.","Ne(<em>g</em>) will escape faster because the Ne(<em>g</em>) atoms have a higher average kinetic energy than the He(<em>g</em>) atoms.","<p>Both gases will escape at the same rate because the atoms of both gases have the same average kinetic energy. </p>"],"answer":-1}]
