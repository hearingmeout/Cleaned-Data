The apparatus consists of three connected vertical cylinders and is attached to a battery. The middle cylinder is a reservoir for water. The cylinder on the left holds the cathode and collects hydrogen. The cylinder on the right holds the anode and collects oxygen. The volume of the collected hydrogen is approximately two times the volume of the collected oxygen. Bubbles are shown forming at both the cathode and the anode. The cathode is connected by a wire to the negative terminal of the battery. The anode is connected by a wire to the positive terminal of the battery.
