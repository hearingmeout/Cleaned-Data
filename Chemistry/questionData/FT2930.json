[{"id":"FT2930","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"A kinetics experiment is set up to collect the gas that is generated when a sample of chalk, consisting primarily of solid CaCO<sub>3</sub>, is added to a solution of ethanoic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH. The rate of reaction between CaCO<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is determined by measuring the volume of gas generated at 22<sup>o</sup>C and 1 atm as a function of time. Which of the following experimental conditions is most likely to increase the rate of gas production?","choicesHtml":["<p>Decreasing the volume of ethanoic acid solution used in the experiment</p>","<p>Decreasing the concentration of the ethanoic acid solution used in the experiment</p>","<p>Decreasing the temperature at which the experiment is performed</p>","<p>Decreasing the particle size of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> by grinding it into a fine powder</p>"],"answer":2}]
