Consider two alloys, one of Au and Cu and one of Au and Ag, each with the same mole fraction of Au. If the Au/Cu alloy is harder than the Au/Ag alloy, then which of the following is the best explanation based on the information in the table above?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>Cu has two common oxidation states, but Ag has only one.</p>","<p>Cu has a higher melting point than Au has, but Ag has a lower melting point than Au has.</p>","<p>Cu atoms are smaller than Ag atoms, thus they interfere more with the displacement of atoms in the alloy.</p>","<p>Cu atoms are less polarizable than are Au or Ag atoms, thus Cu has weaker interparticle forces.</p>"],"answer":1}]
