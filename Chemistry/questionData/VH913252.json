The second diagram is labeled “Solvent B.” Two black ovals, slightly separated and slightly higher than the two black ovals in Solvent A are represented. The third diagram is labeled “Solvent C.” Two black ovals, greatly separated, with one black oval near the solid line and the other black oval halfway up the chromatogram toward the dashed line, are represented.
