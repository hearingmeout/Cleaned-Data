The structure on the left shows one N atom and two C atoms arranged horizontally at its center. The atoms are connected by single bonds.

One of the O atoms, which extends above the second C atom, is connected by a double bond and has two pairs of nonbonding electrons. The other O atom, which extends to the right of the second C atom, is connected by a single bond and has three pairs of nonbonding electrons.
