The horizontal axis is labeled “Volume of 0.10 molar Base Added, in milliliters,” and the numbers 0.0 through 10.0, in increments of 2.0, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “p H” and the numbers 0 through 14, in increments of 2, are indicated. Note that all values are approximate. The curve begins on the vertical axis at a pH of 1.75. The curve moves very gradually upward and to the right at first. It levels off and is horizontal as it reaches a pH of 4 at 3.0 milliliters of base added. It then moves gradually upward and to the right again, reaching a pH of 4.5 at 5.0 milliliters of base added. It then moves steeply upward and to the right and becomes vertical at 6.0 milliliters, passing through a pH of 9 at the midpoint of this vertical portion of the curve, before it begins to level off as it reaches a pH of 12.5 at 7.0 milliliters. It then continues gradually upward and to the right until it ends at a pH of 13 at 10.0 milliliters.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR843811.g05.svg\"/></div></div></div></div></body></html>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2\"><math alttext=\"2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>2</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"4\"><math alttext=\"4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>4</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"8\"><math alttext=\"8\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>8</mn></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"13\"><math alttext=\"13\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>13</mn></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":1}]
