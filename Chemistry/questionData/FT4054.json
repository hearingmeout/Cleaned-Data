The numbers appearing on the horizontal axis, from left to right, are from zero point zero to 30 point zero, in increments of five point zero. The numbers appearing on the vertical axis, from bottom to top, are from zero to 14, in increments of 2. A curve begins on the vertical axis at a p H of approximately 2 point five. The curve moves up and to the right and is fairly steep at first, then becomes less steep. This less steep part of the curve extends from a volume of about 5 milliliters to 15 milliliters and a p H of about 4 point five to 5 point five. The curve then becomes much steeper until it is nearly vertical at about twenty point zero milliliters. It is nearly vertical between a p H of approximately 7 point 5 and ten. It then becomes much less steep and almost levels off at a p H of approximately 13 point five.\" height=\"485\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/90636c2003949d69cb05448617e79664/original.png\" width=\"285\" /></p>\n\n<p>Data collected during the titration of a 20.0 mL sample of a 0.10 <em>M</em> solution of a monoprotic acid with a solution of NaOH of unknown concentration are plotted in the graph above.
