The graph is titled Pressure Versus Volume for Water at 80 degrees Celsius. The horizontal axis is labeled Volume, in liters, and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Pressure, in atmospheres, and the numbers 0 through 1.2, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. Different regions of the line are labeled A, B, C, and D. The line is as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line starts at pressure 1 atmosphere and volume 0, near label A. It moves vertically at volume 0 until it reaches pressure 0.45 atmosphere. From volume 0 and 0.45 atmosphere, the line moves horizontally until it reaches 6 liters. This region of the line is labeled as B. The line gradually moves down and to the right ending at volume 20 liters and pressure 0.15 atmosphere. The region of the curve where the volume is greater than 6 liters, the pressure is greater than 0.2 atmosphere, and the downward slope is larger is labeled C. The region of the curve where the line ends at 20 liters and 0.15 atmosphere is labeled D.\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH962314.g01.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A cylinder with a moveable piston is completely filled with a small amount (100 millimoles) of liquid water at a pressure of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1.0 atmosphere\"><math alttext=\"1.0 atmosphere\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>1.0</mtext><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>atm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and a temperature of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"80 degrees Celsius\"><math alttext=\"80 degrees Celsius\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msup><mrow><mtext>80</mtext></mrow><mrow><mo>∘</mo></mrow></msup><mtext>C</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
