The first row of the table contains the name acetone and a structural formula consisting of a chain of three C atoms connected with single bonds. The first and third C atoms are each connected with single bonds to three H atoms. The middle C atom is connected with a double bond to an O atom.  The molar mass is 58.1 grams per mole.\nThe second row of the table contains the name 1-propanol and a structural formula consisting of a chain of three C atoms connected with single bonds. The first C atom is connected with single bonds to three H atoms, the second C atom is connected with single bonds to two H atoms, and the third C atom is connected with single bonds to two H atoms and to one O atom, which is connected with a single bond to one H atom.  The molar mass is 60.1 grams per mole. \nThe third row of the table contains the name butane and a structural formula consisting of a chain of four C atoms connected with single bonds. The first and fourth C atoms are connected with single bonds to three H atoms, the second and third C atoms are connected with single bonds to two H atoms. The molar mass is 58.1 grams per mole. \" height=\"354\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/52fe222f-4d04-453c-8372-15492bbb80e2.png\" width=\"375\" /></p>\n\n<p>The table above shows the structural formulas and molar masses for three different compounds.
