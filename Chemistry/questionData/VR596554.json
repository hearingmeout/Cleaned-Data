One arrow points toward the top two rows from the left, and one arrow points toward the bottom two rows from the right. In the diagram labeled After, the top two rows of cations and anions are separated from the bottom two rows, and the top two rows are positioned to the right of the bottom two rows. The cations at the bottom of the top two rows align with the cations at the top of the bottom two rows.
