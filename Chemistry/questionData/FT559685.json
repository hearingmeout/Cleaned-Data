There are evenly spaced tick marks on the horizontal axis labeled 0 to 3600 from left to right, in increments of 400.  There are evenly spaced tick marks on the vertical axis labeled from negative 50 to positive 100 from bottom to top, in increments of 25. The graph consists of five line segments connected sequentially. The first line segment begins at the origin and moves up steeply to a temperature of zero degrees Celsius at about 100 k J.  The second line segment is horizontal at 0 degrees Celsius from 100 k J until just past 400 k J. The third line segment starts just past 400 k J and is angled up a little less steeply than the first line segment from 0 degrees Celsius up to 100 degrees Celsius, ending at about 800 k J.  Then the fourth line segment is horizontal at 100 degrees Celsius from about 800 k J until just past 3200 k J.  The last line segment moves up for a very short distance and ends. The horizontal line segment at 100 degrees Celsius from 800 k J to just past 3200 k J is labeled X.\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/5c47a2a5d0e8913a916969e56b613985/original.png\" width=\"650\">\n<p>At 1.0 atm a sample of ice is heated to liquid water and then to water vapor.
