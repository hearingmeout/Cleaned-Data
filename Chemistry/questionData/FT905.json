Justify your answer.<br>\n(ii) Which factor, the change in enthalpy, ΔH<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub> or the change in entropy, ΔS<sup>o</sup><sub>298</sub>, provides the principal driving force for the reaction at 298 K? Explain.<br>\n(iii) For the reaction, how is the value of the standard free energy change, ΔG<sup>o</sup>, affected by an increase in temperature? Explain.<br>\n(b) Some reactions that are predicted by their sign of ΔG<sup>o</sup> to be spontaneous at room temperature do not proceed at a measurable rate at room temperature.<br>\n(i) Account for this apparent contradiction.<br>\n(ii) A suitable catalyst increases the rate of such a reaction. What effect does the catalyst have on ΔG<sup>o</sup> for the reaction? Explain.</p>\n"}]
