Each C O molecule is moving to the right and each N O 2 molecule is moving to the left directly towards the C O molecule. In Diagram 1, the orientation of the C O molecule has the O atom on the left, connected to the C atom on the right.  The orientation of the N O 2 molecule has an O atom on the left, facing the C atom in the C O molecule, connected to an N atom, which is connected to the second O atom.  In Diagram 2 the orientation of the C O molecule is the same as the one in Diagram 1.  The orientation of the N O 2 molecule has the N atom facing the C atom in the C O molecule, connected to the two O atoms.    \" height=\"221\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH934197.g03.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The two diagrams above represent collisions that take place at the same temperature between a <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C O \"><math alttext=\"C O \" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mtext>CO</mtext></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> molecule and an <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"N O 2\"><math alttext=\"N O 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>NO</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> molecule.
