This reaction is extremely slow in aqueous solution. However, when sucrase is added as shown in the diagram, the rate of the reaction is about 6,000,000 times faster. Based on this information, which of the following best explains the large increase in the rate of hydrolysis that occurs with the addition of sucrase?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH945986_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The reaction proceeds through a different reaction path with a lower activation energy in which the sucrase-sucrose complex is formed as an intermediate.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The addition of the sucrase reduces the number of effective collisions between the water and sucrose molecules.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The reaction proceeds through a different reaction path that is independent of temperature and concentration.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The addition of the sucrase decreases the number of sucrose molecules that have the minimum energy required to overcome the activation energy barrier.</p>"],"answer":0}]
