The figure on the left is labeled cis-two-butene and is in equilibrium with the figure on the F right labeled trans-two-butene. The figure labeled cis-two-butene consists of a chain with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond. The left carbon in the double bond also has one methyl, C H 3, group attached with a single bond to the left and above of the carbon atom and a hydrogen atom connected with a single bond to the left and below the carbon atom. The right carbon atom in the double bond has a methyl, C H 3, group attached above and to the right of the carbon atom and a hydrogen atom connected with a single bond to the right and below the carbon atom. In other words, the methyl groups are on the same side of the carbon-carbon double bond. The figure labeled trans-two-butene consists of a chain with two carbon atoms connected by a double bond.
