The vertical axis is labeled “Absorbance,” and the numbers 0.00 through 1.00, in increments of 0.20, are indicated. A key indicates that one set of data represents the first trial and that the other set of data represents the second trial. The data for the first trial are as follows: 2.2 comma 0.19, 4.5 comma 0.38, 7.2 comma 0.55, and 9.1 comma 0.70.
