(3)&nbsp;The specimen unearthed by the scientists lived between 110 and 100 million years ago, meaning that the species was an early member of the titanosaur group. (4)&nbsp;By studying this new dinosaur, paleontologists believe they can <span id=\"ref-035-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-035 passage_reference_highlight\">determine the precise function of its mysteriously heart-shaped tail bones</span>.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(5)&nbsp;The announcement in February 2019 created a great buzz in both the scientific community and the general <span id=\"ref-036-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-036 passage_reference_highlight\">public. (6) This excitement was in part because of a unique feature</span></span>: the titanosaur’s heart-shaped tail bones. (7)&nbsp;Indeed, the dinosaur’s name, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia</span>, <span id=\"ref-033-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-033 passage_reference_highlight\">comes</span> from the Swahili for “animal of the Mtuka with a heart-shaped tail.” (8)&nbsp;Eric Gorscak, the paleontologist who led the excavation, described the long process involved in unearthing the titanosaur fossils from the Mtuka riverbed in Tanzania, a complicated endeavor that required excavators to scale a cliff wall with climbing gear. (9)&nbsp;Gorscak’s team knew they had found a new species thanks to the <span id=\"ref-037-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-037 passage_reference_highlight\">weird</span> tail bones, as well as specific neck and chest bones. (10)&nbsp;As for the function of the heart-shaped tail bones, Patrick O’Connor, a coauthor on the study, theorizes that <span id=\"ref-034-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-034 passage_reference_highlight\">they might have</span> allowed the titanosaur to stiffen its long tail.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(11)&nbsp;The location of the dinosaur find, however, excited scientists even more than the distinctive tail bones. (12)&nbsp;Until recently, most titanosaur fossil discoveries have been in South America. (13)&nbsp;Hence, this new discovery of an early titanosaur species in Tanzania “provides a critical look at the group before the widespread diversification around the planet,” says O’Connor. (14)&nbsp;And while titanosaurs were one of the most <span id=\"ref-038-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-038 passage_reference_highlight\">domineering</span> groups during the age of dinosaurs, says Gorscak, “their early evolutionary history remains obscure, and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Mnyamawamtuka</span> helps reveal those beginnings.” (15)&nbsp;Gorscak plans additional fossil digs in other parts of Africa, hoping to find other critical pieces of the Cretaceous titanosaur puzzle.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Deleting “with remarkable frequency”<span class=\"focus_reference\" data-focus-ref=\"ref-031\"><a aria-label=\"Link to referenced content\" class=\"dap_reference_link\" href=\"#ref-031-link-start\"><span class=\"cb-glyph cb-dbl-right cb-blue2-color cb-glyph-xs\"></span> </a></span></p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Changing “have undoubtedly uncovered the”<span class=\"focus_reference\" data-focus-ref=\"ref-032\"><a aria-label=\"Link to referenced content\" class=\"dap_reference_link\" href=\"#ref-032-link-start\"><span class=\"cb-glyph cb-dbl-right cb-blue2-color cb-glyph-xs\"></span> </a></span> to “may have uncovered&nbsp;a”</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Adding “most likely” before “comes”<span class=\"focus_reference\" data-focus-ref=\"ref-033\"><a aria-label=\"Link to referenced content\" class=\"dap_reference_link\" href=\"#ref-033-link-start\"><span class=\"cb-glyph cb-dbl-right cb-blue2-color cb-glyph-xs\"></span> </a></span></p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Changing “they might have”<span class=\"focus_reference\" data-focus-ref=\"ref-034\"><a aria-label=\"Link to referenced content\" class=\"dap_reference_link\" href=\"#ref-034-link-start\"><span class=\"cb-glyph cb-dbl-right cb-blue2-color cb-glyph-xs\"></span> </a></span> to “the heart-shaped tail bones may have”</p>\n"],"answer":1}]
