Her beak is open. She breathes hot hawk breath in my face. It smells of pepper and musk and burned stone. Her feathers are half-raised and her wings half-open, and her scaled yellow toes and curved black talons grip the glove tightly. It feels like I’m holding a flaming torch. I can feel the heat of her fear on my face. She stares. She stares and stares. <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_3 itemref:VR597042\" id=\"VR597036_3\"></span>Seconds<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_3\"></span> slow and tick past.

It’s what you do when a fresh hawk sits on your left fist with food beneath her feet, <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_31 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_31\"></span>in a state of savage, defensive fear.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_31\"></span> <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_14 itemref:VR597058\" id=\"VR597036_14\"></span>Hawks aren’t social animals like dogs or horses; they understand neither coercion nor punishment. The only way to tame them is <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_32 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_32\"></span>through positive reinforcement<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_32\"></span> with gifts of food.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_14\"></span> You want the hawk to eat the food you hold—it’s the first step in <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_15 itemref:VR597049\" id=\"VR597036_15\"></span>reclaiming<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_15\"></span> her that will end with you <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_33 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_33\"></span>being hunting partners.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_33\"></span> But the space between the fear and the food is a vast, vast gulf, and you have to cross it together. I thought, once, that you did it by <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_34 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_34\"></span>being infinitely patient.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_34\"></span> But no: it is more than that. You must become invisible. Imagine: you’re in a darkened room. You are <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_35 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_35\"></span>sitting with a hawk on your fist.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_35\"></span> <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_16 itemref:VR597045\" id=\"VR597036_16\"></span>She is as immobile, as tense and sprung as a catapult at full stretch.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_16\"></span> Underneath her huge, thorny feet is a chunk of raw steak. You’re trying to get her to look at the steak, not at you, because you know—though you haven’t looked—that her eyes are fixed in horror at your profile. All you can hear is the wet <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">click, click, click</span> of her blinking.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_17\"></span></p><p class=\"passage_para\">To cross this space between fear and food, and to somehow make possible an <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_30 itemref:VR597046\" id=\"VR597036_30\"></span>eventual concord<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_30\"></span> between your currently paralysed, immobile minds, you need—very urgently—not to be there. You empty your mind and become very still. You think of exactly nothing at all. The hawk becomes a strange, hollow concept, as flat as a snapshot or a schematic drawing, but at the same time, as pertinent to your future as an angry high court judge. Your gloved fist squeezes the meat a fraction, and <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_7 itemref:VR597052\" id=\"VR597036_7\"></span>you feel the tiny imbalance of weight<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_7\"></span> and you see out of the very corner of your vision that she’s looked down at it. And so, remaining invisible, <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_8 itemref:VR597052\" id=\"VR597036_8\"></span>you <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_25 itemref:VR597056\" id=\"VR597036_25\"></span>make<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_25\"></span> the food the only thing in the room<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_8\"></span> apart from the hawk; you’re not there at all. And <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_9 itemref:VR597052\" id=\"VR597036_9\"></span>what you hope is that she’ll start eating,<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_9\"></span> and you can very, very slowly <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_26 itemref:VR597056\" id=\"VR597036_26\"></span>make<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_26\"></span> yourself visible. Even if you don’t move a muscle, and <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_10 itemref:VR597052\" id=\"VR597036_10\"></span>just relax into a more normal frame of mind,<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_10\"></span> the hawk <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_36 itemref:VR597051\" id=\"VR597036_36\"></span><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">knows.</span><span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_36\"></span> It’s extraordinary. <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_11 itemref:VR597052\" id=\"VR597036_11\"></span>It takes a long time to be yourself,<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_11\"></span> in the presence of a new hawk.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_18\"></span><span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_28\"></span></p><p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_39 itemref:VR597063\" id=\"VR597036_39\"></span><span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_22 itemref:VR597055\" id=\"VR597036_22\"></span><span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_21 itemref:VR597064\" id=\"VR597036_21\"></span><span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_19 itemref:VR597053\" id=\"VR597036_19\"></span>But I didn’t have to learn how to do this. I was already an expert. It was a trick I’d learned early in my life; a small, slightly fearful girl, obsessed with birds, who loved to disappear.

I had always been a watcher. When I was a child I’d climb the hill behind my house and crawl into my favourite den under a rhododendron bush, wriggling down on my tummy under overhanging leaves like a tiny sniper. And in this secret foxhole, nose an inch from the ground, breathing crushed bracken and acid soil, I’d look down on the world below, basking in the fierce calm that comes from being invisible but seeing everything.<span class=\"focus_end focus_idref:VR597036_19\"></span> <span class=\"focus_start focus_id:VR597036_23 itemref:VR597059\" id=\"VR597036_23\"></span>Watching, not doing.
