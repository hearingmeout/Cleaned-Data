As the then leader of the African National Congress (ANC)—a resistance organization dedicated to combating the apartheid (institutionalized racial segregation) policies of South Africa’s white ruling party—Mandela is widely credited for his negotiations with the country’s leaders to end apartheid in 1994. He was elected the first Black president of South Africa later that year. The following passage is an excerpt from Obama’s speech. Read the passage carefully. Write an essay that analyzes the rhetorical choices Obama makes to achieve his purpose of praising and memorializing Nelson Mandela.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<span class=\"list_heading\">In your response you should do the following:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Respond to the prompt with a thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Select and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Demonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">1</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Mandela’s clan name, by which he was affectionately referred to by many South Africans</span></span> would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement—a movement that at its start had little prospect for success. Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice.<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">2</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., led nonviolent resistance movements to achieve independence in India and civil rights in the United States, respectively.</span></span> He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War.<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">3</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Mandela was imprisoned from 1962 to 1990 for his resistance activities. John F. Kennedy was president of the United States from 1961 to 1963. Nikita Khrushchev was the premier of the Soviet Union from 1958 to 1964.</span></span> Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would—like Abraham Lincoln—hold his country together when it threatened to break apart. And like America’s Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations—a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, it’s tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men. But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait. Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories. “I am not a saint,” he said, “unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection—because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens that he carried—that we loved him so. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood—a son and a husband, a father and a friend. And that’s why we learned so much from him, and that’s why we can learn from him still. For nothing he achieved was inevitable. In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith. He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Perhaps Mandela was right that he inherited “a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness” from his father. And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of “a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments . . . a desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">But like other early giants of the ANC—the Sisulus and Tambos<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">4</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo were prominent members and leaders in the ANC, as well as personal friends and colleagues of Mandela.</span></span>—Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity. Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price. “I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I’ve cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you don’t agree with. He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet. He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades of prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depended upon his.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must also be chiseled into law and institutions. He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history. On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that “prisoners cannot enter into contracts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal. And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
