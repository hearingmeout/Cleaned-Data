(2) Psychologists Jessie Sun and Simine Vazire at the University of California, Davis, have shown that while people offer accurate self-assessments of many individual traits, they tend to miss when they are being rude to others. (3) As it turns out, knowing what your personality is generally like is not the same as accurately discerning how you are behaving in the moment—an important distinction when it comes to treating other people considerately.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(4) According to Sun and Vazire, self-knowledge can be divided into trait self-knowledge and state self-knowledge—in other words, knowledge of your own characteristics as opposed to “knowledge of how your personality fluctuates from moment to moment.” (5) Sun and Vazire <span id=\"ref-002-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-002 passage_reference_highlight\"> conspired on</span> an experiment to study the latter category. (6) The study’s experimental subjects were equipped with audio recorders that would automatically activate every 9.5 minutes during the day, recording thirty seconds of audio at each activation. (7)&nbsp;Participants completed self-evaluations at certain times of day according to several different personality measurements: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(8) The self-assessments and the ratings of objective observers generally aligned. (9)&nbsp;But Sun and Vazire noticed some major differences among different categories of personality traits. (10)&nbsp;Participants often reported feeling more neurotic <span id=\"ref-003-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-003 passage_reference_highlight\"> —anxious or worried—</span> than the observers believed. (11) However, there were even larger discrepancies between observers’ and subjects’ assessments of agreeableness—a description encompassing qualities like warmth, friendliness, and tact. (12) Sun and Vazire saw these results as remarkable, given that agreeableness might be expected to be a more obvious trait.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(13) Sun and Vazire argue that the study underscores the importance of state self-knowledge in ordinary interactions, since “being aware of and able to do something about your disagreeableness in the moment might be more useful than knowing that you are generally a disagreeable person.” (14) <span id=\"ref-004-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-004 passage_reference_highlight\"> These facts make it obvious that everyone should behave accordingly.</span></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because it strengthens the passage by providing evidence in favor of accepting the study’s conclusions.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the reader might otherwise wonder how the study compares to similar research in the field.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the intended audience is likely to be bored by discussions of research methodology.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because it detracts from the discussion of the implications of the study’s findings and thus interrupts the flow of the passage’s conclusion.</p>"],"answer":4}]
