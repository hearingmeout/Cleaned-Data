(2) “We do not feel strongly enough that we are part of a global community,” he warned. (3) But Eliasson and other artists can help address this problem: art has the potential to foster communication that strengthens existing communities and helps form new ones.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(4) Artworks created by artists outside of a particular community often do not appeal to members of that community because of a lack of connection between the artists and their intended audience. (5) This dynamic is illustrated in printmaker Amos Paul Kennedy Jr.’s 2017–2018 piece <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Passin’ on to Others</span>. (6) Kennedy collected commonplace phrases from customers of local barbershops and salons in Richmond, Virginia, and hand printed them on multicolored posters. (7) Kennedy’s transformation and display of sayings such as “higher the hair, closer to heaven” celebrated the daily experiences of salon patrons, reinforcing the self-esteem of stylists and patrons alike and getting everyone talking. (8) What the artwork had accomplished, in effect, was a recontextualization of the style community’s experiences. (9) Words that previously had passed unremarked now joined other aphorisms and sayings that Kennedy has printed on posters.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(10) Experiencing art doesn’t just highlight existing connections; it actively forges new ones. (11) In galleries and performance halls, people come together for events Eliasson describes as “strongly rooted in a physical experience, in our bodies.” (12) Not all artworks are experienced in galleries and performance halls, however. (13) Former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts Jane Chu explains how playing the piano connected her to others at a time when, as a child of immigrants, she felt out of step with her parents and community. (14) “I felt as though I belonged,” she says of her performances, “because I had an avenue of expression beyond just the linear use of everyday words.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(15) By pulling us out of our habitual ways of thinking and communicating, art provides us with opportunities to renew and even create connections to a larger society.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">(as it is now)</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">it is best experienced firsthand</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">in many cases it is produced collaboratively</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">it provides some people with a livelihood</p>"],"answer":0}]
