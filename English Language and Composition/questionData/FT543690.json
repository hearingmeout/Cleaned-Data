What makes us decide to do one thing when we might do another thing instead? The question seems unanswerable, since life presents us with many types of choices, and no single explanation can be expected to cover every case. Deciding whether to order the lobster or the steak is not the same sort of thing as deciding whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In the first case (assuming price is not an object) we consult our taste; in the second we consult our judgment, and try to keep our taste out of it. But knowing more or less what category a particular decision belongs to— knowing whether it is a matter of personal preference or a matter of impersonal judgment—doesn’t make that decision any easier to make. “Order what you feel like eating,” says your impatient dinner companion. But the problem is that you don’t <em>know </em>what you feel like eating. What you feel like eating is precisely what you are trying to figure out.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“Order what you feel like eating” is just a piece of advice about the criteria you should be using to guide your deliberations. It is not a solution to your menu problem—just as “Do the right thing” and “Tell the truth” are only suggestions about criteria, not answers to actual dilemmas. The actual dilemma is what, in the particular case staring you in the face, the right thing to do or the honest thing to say really is. And making those kinds of decisions—about what is right or what is truthful—<em>is </em>like deciding what to order in a restaurant, in the sense that getting a handle on tastiness is no harder or easier (even though it is generally less important) than getting a handle on justice or truth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>People reach decisions, most of the time, by thinking. This is a pretty banal statement, but the process it names is inscrutable. An acquaintance gives you a piece of information in strict confidence; later on, a close friend, lacking that information, is about to make a bad mistake. Do you betray the confidence? “Do the right thing”—but what is the right thing? Keeping your word, or helping someone you care about avoid injury or embarrassment? Even in this two-sentence hypothetical case, the choice between principles is complicated—as it always is in life—by circumstances. If it had been the close friend who gave you the information and the acquaintance who was about to make the mistake, you would almost certainly think about your choice differently—as you would if you thought that the acquaintance was a nasty person, or that the friend was a lucky person, or that the statute of limitations on the secret had probably run out, or that you had acquired a terrible habit of betraying confidences and really ought to break it. In the end, you will do what you believe is “right,” but “rightness” will be, in effect, the compliment you give to the outcome of your deliberations. Though it is always in view while you are thinking, “what is right” is something that appears in its complete form at the end, not the beginning, of your deliberation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When we think, in other words, we do not simply consult principles, or reasons, or sentiments, or tastes; for prior to thinking, all those things are indeterminate. Thinking is what makes them real. Deciding to order the lobster helps us determine that we have a taste for lobster; deciding that the defendant is guilty helps us establish the standard of justice that applies in this case; choosing to keep a confidence helps make honesty a principle and choosing to betray it helps to confirm the value we put on friendship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that our choices are arbitrary or self-serving—that standards and principles are just whatever it is in our interest to say they are, pretexts for satisfying selfish ends or gratifying hidden impulses? There is no way to answer this question, except to say that it rarely <em>feels </em>as though this is the case. We usually don’t end up deciding to do what seems pleasant or convenient at the moment; experience teaches us that this is rarely a wise basis for making a choice. (“If merely ‘feeling good’ could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience,” as James* once put it.) When we are happy with a decision, it doesn’t feel arbitrary; it feels like the decision we <em>had </em>to reach. And this is because its inevitability is a function of its “fit” with the whole inchoate set of assumptions of our self understanding and of the social world we inhabit, the assumptions that give the moral weight—much greater moral weight than logic or taste could ever give—to every judgment we make. This is why, so often, we know we’re right before we know <em>why </em>we’re right. First we decide, then we deduce.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\">*William James (1842–1910), American philosopher and psychologist, was a leader of the philosophical movement of Pragmatism.</span></p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>outline a solution</p>","question a&nbsp;theory","<p>resolve a dilemma</p>","<p>reinforce an idea</p>"],"answer":3}]
