(2) However, while emojis have a growing—and perhaps indispensable—role in modern communication, they will never become a language of their own.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(3) Some people have actually tried to force emojis to act as a language. (4) In fact, graphic designer Joe Hale went so far as to “translate” all of <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Alice in Wonderland</span> into emojis. (5) The fact that one needs to “read” Hale’s version alongside the printed text of the original, however, demonstrates the fact that emojis simply do not function in the same way words do. (6) Instead, emojis are icons that, as linguist Vyvyan Evans points out, “do not constitute a language because they do not have a grammar that allows them to be combined into more complex units of meaning.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(7) The power of emojis, and the likely reason for their popularity, is that they add context and nuance to written communication. (8) When we are speaking to other people, according to Evans, “70% of the meaning . . . comes from non-verbal cues.” (9) Those cues (inflection and tone, body language, facial expressions, etc.) are not available in written communications, which can lead to misunderstandings. (10) Emojis were invented to minimize those misunderstandings, and as e-mails, text messages, and social media posts have become more and more common, the implementation of emojis has gone through the roof. (11) Even in 2015 there were already 6 billion emojis sent in text messages every day.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(12) As we communicate more using our computers and phones, we are likely to see more emojis, though the list of fun facts on guesstheemoji.org reminds us that emojis are not the same as emoticons. (13) They still play an important role in fostering clear and nuanced communication.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Keep it, because it develops the contrast the writer is creating between the ideas in this sentence and those in the previous one.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Keep it, because it offers information that may be helpful to the audience in understanding a potentially unfamiliar term.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Delete it, because it does not include appropriate citations to indicate where the writer got this information.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Delete it, because it interrupts the point the writer is trying to make by introducing details that are irrelevant.</p>"],"answer":2}]
