Political leaders, who use the tools of mass propaganda to create a sense of faux intimacy with citizens, no longer need to be competent, sincere, or honest. They need only to appear to have these qualities. Most of all they need a story, a personal narrative. The reality of the narrative is irrelevant. It can be completely at odds with the facts. The consistency and emotional appeal of the story are paramount. Those who are best at deception succeed. Those who have not mastered the art of entertainment, who fail to create a narrative or do not have one fashioned for them by their handlers, are ignored. They become “unreal.”</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">An image-based culture communicates through narratives, pictures, and pseudo-drama.</p>\n\n<p>Write an essay that argues your position on Hedges’ argument that “the most essential skill . . . is artifice.”</p>\n\n<p>In your response you should do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.</li>\n\t<li>Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
