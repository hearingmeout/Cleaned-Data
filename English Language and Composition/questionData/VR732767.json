(3) But before James Bond was the name of a famous fictional spy, it was the name of a real person: an ornithologist (a scientist who studies birds) whose guidebook <span class=\"published_title\">Birds of the West Indies</span> was a standard reference work for bird-watchers in the Caribbean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(4) One of those bird-watchers was Ian Fleming, who spent his winters in Jamaica and wrote most of his books there. (5) Fleming often consulted Bond’s guidebook and was struck, as he explained years later in a letter to the ornithologist’s wife, by the “brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name” of its author. (6) Finding these qualities fitting for the character he was developing, Fleming borrowed the name for his novels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(7) The scientist James Bond was appalled to find himself connected to the protagonist of a series of sensationalistic spy thrillers. (8) When asked about the books, he asserted that he did not read them, and he turned down an offer for a paid appearance at the premiere of the Bond film <span class=\"published_title\">Goldfinger</span>. (9)&nbsp;Nevertheless, the real Bond was comfortable enough with the association to complain about prank calls he received from fans of the character. (10)&nbsp;When the two men met, they connected over the thing that had brought them together in the first place: their mutual love of the island’s beautiful birds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">(as it is now)</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">have heard the simple but clear</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">are impressed by the sophisticated</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">instantly recognize the iconic</p>"],"answer":4}]
