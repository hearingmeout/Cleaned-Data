I won the game, and everything faded away as a single tear rolled down my cheek—the way athletes cry after a championship win in the movies.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 3</span> <span class=\"highlight_ref-011 passage_reference_highlight\">Me, midrun, a smile on my face, because I couldn’t believe I was quickly moving.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 4</span> I have a milder form of cerebral palsy.<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">1</span><span class=\"footnote_text\">a condition that affects muscle control, body movement, balance, and posture</span></span> <span id=\"ref-012-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-012 passage_reference_highlight\">I walk with a limp.</span> I had given up on the idea of running after surgeries on the right side of my body left me too afraid to relearn how to run.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 5</span> <span id=\"ref-013-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-013 passage_reference_highlight\">These reveries left me waiting for a “special talent,” which I assumed all disabled kids had, to make up for their disability.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 6</span> I’m a terrible singer, so I figured I’d find a hidden gift in a sport we played in physical education class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"paragraph_number\"><span class=\"sr-only\">paragraph</span> 7</span> I never did, and I yearn for representation of people of color with disabilities in sports.
