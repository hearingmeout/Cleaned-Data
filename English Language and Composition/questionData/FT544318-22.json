Boorstin, an American historian, discusses the difference between dissent and disagreement in the excerpt below from his book <em>The Decline of Radicalism</em> (1969).</p>\n\n<p>Dissent is the great problem of America today. It overshadows all others. It is a symptom, an expression, a consequence, and a cause of all others.</p>\n\n<p>I say dissent and not disagreement. And it is the distinction between dissent and disagreement which I really want to make. Disagreement produces debate but dissent produces dissension. Dissent (which comes from the Latin, <em>dis</em> and <em>sentire</em>) means originally to feel apart from others.</p>\n\n<p>People who disagree have an argument, but people who dissent have a quarrel. People may disagree and both may count themselves in the majority. But a person who dissents is by definition in a minority. A liberal society thrives on disagreement but is killed by dissension. Disagreement is the life blood of democracy, dissension is its cancer.</p>\n\n<p>Write an essay that argues your position on Boorstin’s distinction between dissent and disagreement.</p>\n\n<p>In your response you should do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.</li>\n\t<li>Provide evidence to support your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.</li>\n\t<li>Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
