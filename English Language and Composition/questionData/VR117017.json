(4)&nbsp;The dangers of this lack of genetic diversity are illustrated by the story of the Cavendish’s predecessor in the global market: the Gros Michel banana. (5)&nbsp;Lacking any variants that were resistant to fusarium wilt, the Gros Michel was wiped out by the 1960s. (6)&nbsp;Banana growers replaced the Gros Michel with the Cavendish, which was immune to fusarium wilt, but a new fungus that affects the Cavendish has recently appeared in several banana-producing countries.
