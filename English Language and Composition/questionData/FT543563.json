In addition to school essays, there were poems written to order for family celebrations as well as word games, like writing nonsense verses in alternate lines, all of which required verbal facility. These circumstances were of singular importance for women.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By the late nineteenth century, diary and letter writing had become predominantly female arts. If women did not monopolize them, they were thought to have special talents or responsibilities for their performance. Once a common spiritual exercise for both sexes, diary keeping had evolved into something of a calling for female adolescents of the comfortable classes. Often presented by parents as gifts to girls in their early teens, diaries were sanctioned as a technique for promoting discipline and character, a practice that might aid in the transition from sometimes ornery adolescence to more pliant womanhood. In their pages, girls recorded, sometimes painfully, their struggles to “be good,” to settle gnawing religious doubts, to subdue their pride or resentment at parental authority. Whatever the intent of adults, by fostering exploration of inner lives, diaries often promoted self-reflection of an individualistic sort in ways that allowed for a more assertive female subjectivity. In their (presumably) secret pages, girls could express anger and try out a variety of identities, some of them at least mildly subversive. Perhaps critics were right to consider diaries sufficiently dangerous to warn against them, as some did in the 1870s.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Diaries assumed their greatest importance during adolescence, but women of all ages were often prodigious letter writers. As those charged with the emotional well-being of extended as well as nuclear families, women kept in touch with absent members and distant relatives. The pattern began in youth: boys might be expected to write letters, but their lapses were more readily tolerated than those of their sisters. In a mobile society that detached people from their points of origin, women's letters often constituted the primary means of communication between family members. As the principal letter writers, women not only demonstrated their vaunted verbal facility but gained authority in negotiating family matters.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<p>Diary keeping and letter writing originated in gendered obligations. But they were often so much more. In addition to any personal satisfaction they brought, these genres enhanced powers of observation and self-reflection. Self-conscious about their letters, which they knew would be read aloud or passed around among family members, young women labored over their literary productions. Observant correspondents like Alice Hamilton became vivid storytellers who set their scenes with care, created characters out of themselves and the people they met, and adjusted their narratives to fit their intended audience.<sup>4</sup> Earlier in the century, in just this manner, letter writing proved to be an important training ground for Harriet Beecher Stowe, who incorporated techniques she had perfected in her correspondence into her domestic fiction.<sup>5</sup> In creating themselves in and through their diaries and letters (that is, both for themselves and for others), women often drew on models available to them from literature. In this way reading and writing converged.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\"><sup>1 </sup>For an admirably thorough and wide-ranging study of literary practices in everyday life that draws on a vast array of archival sources for an earlier period, see Ronald J.
