There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward <span id=\"ref-022-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-022 passage_reference_highlight\">all that is great and lofty</span></span>, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticize work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an <span id=\"ref-023-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-023 passage_reference_highlight\">intellectual aloofness</span></span> which will not accept contact with life’s realities—all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in <span id=\"ref-024-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-024 passage_reference_highlight\">the stern strife of living</span></span>, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</span></span> Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. <span id=\"ref-027-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-027 passage_reference_highlight\">Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride or slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are.</span></span> The man who does nothing cuts <span id=\"ref-028-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-028 passage_reference_highlight\">the same sordid figure in the pages of history</span></span>, whether he be <span id=\"ref-029-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-029 passage_reference_highlight\">a cynic, or fop,<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">1</span><span class=\"footnote_text\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">fop</span><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">: a vain man devoted to his clothing and appearance</span></span></span> or voluptuary.<span class=\"footnote\" tabindex=\"0\"><span class=\"footnote_mark\">2</span><span class=\"footnote_text\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">voluptuary</span><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">: a person interested in material wealth and physical satisfaction</span></span></span></span></span> There is little use for <span id=\"ref-030-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-030 passage_reference_highlight\">the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion</span></span>, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of <span id=\"ref-031-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-031 passage_reference_highlight\">the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder.</span></span> Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength.
