(2) If da Vinci did have exotropia, in which an eye turns outward, he would not have been the only artist in history with that condition.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(3) Christopher Tyler, a visual neuroscientist at City University of London, noticed a pattern in da Vinci’s portraits and in works depicting the great artist. (4) While few self-portraits of da Vinci exist, Tyler argues that many of da Vinci’s portraits reflect his appearance. (5) As the great artist himself said, the soul “guides the painter’s arm and makes him reproduce himself, since it appears to the soul that this is the best way to represent a human being.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(6) To test his theory that da Vinci had exotropia, Tyler studied the eye alignments of the subjects of six pieces of art that purportedly depict the Renaissance artist himself, including da Vinci’s <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Vitruvian Man</span> and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Salvator Mundi</span> and Andrea del Verrocchio’s sculpture <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">David</span>. (7) The results confirmed Tyler’s suspicions: da Vinci likely had exotropia, with one eye turning out at -10.3 degrees.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(8) Tyler’s findings, which he published in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">JAMA Ophthalmology</span>, created a stir in both the art and science communities. (9) Only about 1 percent of the population has exotropia, yet previous studies have suggested that other famous artists—like Rembrandt, Picasso, and Degas—had it as well, which indicates that the eye condition was more common in centuries past than it is now. (10) Tyler believes that da Vinci’s condition was intermittent—that is, his eye drifted out of alignment when he was relaxed, but when he focused, it would realign. (11) If Tyler is right and da Vinci could control his exotropia, then the artist could switch from 2-D to 3-D vision, enhancing his ability to accurately capture three-dimensional figures on a two-dimensional canvas.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Renaissance, which took place between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, was a period of European cultural and artistic rebirth after the Middle Ages.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A new theory maintains that a visual condition called exotropia, in which an eye turns outward, enabled da Vinci to manipulate his own depth perception.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">In fact, many scholars and historians consider da Vinci as the prime example of a Renaissance Man: a person who possesses many talents in varied areas of interest.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Art scholars tend to study both the artist and the art created within the context of history and the artistic developments of a particular time period.</p>"],"answer":1}]
