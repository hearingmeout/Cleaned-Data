(2)&nbsp;According to <span id=\"ref-027-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-027 passage_reference_highlight\">fanatical tiny house proponents</span>, these houses’ mobility (many tiny houses have wheels and can be moved with a truck), small space requirements, and minimal carbon footprint provide a way to address environmental problems and the rising cost of living in cities. (3)&nbsp;However, while the tiny house trend appears to be <span id=\"ref-028-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-028 passage_reference_highlight\">beneficial on several levels</span>, in reality it is not a practical way to deal with these issues.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(4)&nbsp;One of the most important appeals of tiny houses is their low price. (5)&nbsp;Ranging from $22,000 to $79,000, the prices of tiny houses are far lower than those of new traditional houses, which had a median price of over $300,000 in 2018. (6) <span id=\"ref-022-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-022 passage_reference_highlight\">According to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, the total value of housing in the United States is $27.2 trillion.</span> (7)&nbsp;However, advocates often fail to consider the <span id=\"ref-029-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-029 passage_reference_highlight\">hidden cost</span> of tiny homes: the land they sit on. (8)&nbsp;In many areas, purchasing or renting land for a tiny home <span id=\"ref-023-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-023 passage_reference_highlight\">requires compliance with local building codes</span>. (9) And many cities do not welcome tiny <span id=\"ref-024-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-024 passage_reference_highlight\">homes. (10) In some cases, tiny homes do not meet zoning regulations; in others</span>&nbsp;residents fear tiny homes will decrease property values of neighboring houses.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(11) Another touted benefit of tiny homes is that they are a <span id=\"ref-025-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-025 passage_reference_highlight\"> “greener” housing alternative</span>, but again the reality is more complicated. (12) While tiny houses are more energy efficient than larger buildings, <span id=\"ref-026-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-026 passage_reference_highlight\">the average size of a house—and the associated energy consumption—varies considerably from one country to another</span>.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(13)&nbsp;Although many people see tiny homes as an <span id=\"ref-030-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-030 passage_reference_highlight\">appealing solution to pressing housing problems</span>, cities that are most pressed for space already have a solution that works better: apartment complexes and other efficient, eco-friendly forms of dense housing.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Keep it, because it provides context for the second paragraph’s discussion of housing prices.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Keep it, because it lends credibility to the author’s argument by citing an unbiased source of information.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Delete it, because it only introduces statistics from one research institution and therefore fails to broaden the discussion.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Delete it, because it adds information that is not relevant to the line of reasoning in the second paragraph.</p>"],"answer":4}]
