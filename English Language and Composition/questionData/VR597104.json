(2) After all, archaeology is the study of human history. (3) A recent finding at Eleutherna, the site of an ancient Greek city on Crete, provides a striking example: unearthing the skeleton of a woman, archaeologists struggled to interpret the unusual signs of strain on the bones until they watched a local craftswoman at work. (4) The archaeologists’ interpretation not only challenges popular assumptions about archaeology, but it also forces archaeologists to reexamine their assumptions about women’s work in ancient Greece.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(5) Eleutherna researchers discovered the skeleton in 2009. (6) Preliminary analysis determined that the approximately 50-year-old woman lived between 900 and 650 BCE. (7) Examining her remains, the archaeologists eyeballed something truly wacky: unlike the cartilage of other female specimens at the site, the cartilage on the upper right side of the skeleton’s body and on the right-hip and knee joints was almost completely worn away. (8) This anomaly signified that the woman must have engaged in a long-term strenuous activity involving the right side of her body. (9) Seeking more exact information, the researchers drew on their assumptions about the kinds of work women performed in ancient Greece. (10) Deploying skeletal models, the archaeologists tried bread-baking, weaving, harvesting, etc.—but to no avail.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(11) Wondering if the present could unlock the past, the archaeologists spent several years observing people near Eleutherna who performed tasks similar to those the ancient Greeks would have performed. (12) Success came in 2018 when a female ceramicist modeled her work for the researchers. (13) Analyzing her movements as she worked on large vases and listening to her detail the physical toll of the work, the team was convinced that the ancient Eleuthernan woman whose skeleton it was studying must have been a potter, a guess later confirmed by medical imaging and further anatomical modeling.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">(14) The woman was not just a ceramicist, though. (15) The extent of wear on her remains indicates that she was a <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">master </span>ceramicist. (16) Archaeologists had long assumed that professional pottery making was the exclusive province of males in ancient Greece. (17) The Eleutherna researchers, supplementing Greece’s archaeological discoveries, acknowledge that they have more to learn.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">In fact, the women of ancient Athens were neither allowed to own property nor to enjoy the full rights of citizenship.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No activity typically associated with women would have taxed the body to the extent evidenced by the skeleton.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The type of skeletal models used by the archaeologists at Eleutherna are able to mimic human body movements.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Women in ancient Greece are also closely associated with religious practices, especially ritual care of the dead.</p>"],"answer":1}]
