(2) Lack of sleep is tied to conditions like heart disease and high blood pressure, and businesses lose billions of dollars every year due to lost productivity when workers are too exhausted to perform. (3) Given the importance of sleep and the serious impacts that come from not getting enough, everyone should be tracking their sleep patterns.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(4) A good way to track sleep is with wearable fitness trackers. (5) <span id=\"ref-036-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-036 passage_reference_highlight\">Mostly worn around the wrist, these devices track movement, and many also detect heart rate, so they can provide excellent information about sleep patterns.</span> (6) These devices use an accelerometer to detect movement in three directions: forward/backward, up/down, left/right. (7) Trackers that measure heart rate can also provide data about how much time asleep is spent in deep sleep as opposed to light sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(8) The data these devices provide are not as accurate as the data that come from a sleep lab. (9) <span id=\"ref-037-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-037 passage_reference_highlight\">Polysomnography—a sleep study done in a lab—measures a sleeping person’s brain waves, eye and leg movements, breathing, and heart rate to get a precise measure of how much sleep the person gets, including accurate measurements of light and deep sleep.</span> (10) Fitness trackers are not as accurate. (11) <span id=\"ref-038-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-038 passage_reference_highlight\">One study demonstrated that one fitness tracker overestimated sleep time by more than 60 minutes per night.</span> (12) Most trackers also cost over $100, making them difficult to obtain for many people.</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(13) <span id=\"ref-006-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-006 passage_reference_highlight\"> The potential benefits of monitoring sleep patterns using a fitness tracker, however, outweigh the negatives.</span> (14) With the addition of heart rate monitors, trackers are becoming increasingly accurate. (15) They may never reach the accuracy of polysomnography, but they also do not require a trip to a lab. (16) <span id=\"ref-007-link-start\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"highlight_ref-007 passage_reference_highlight\"> The measurements are not exact, and</span> there is a strong benefit in that people who track their sleep are apt to be more mindful of sleep in general. (17) Data from a fitness tracker can make it possible to discover patterns and learn more about what disrupts sleep and what leads to healthy sleep.
