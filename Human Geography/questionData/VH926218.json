The graph is divided into five vertical sections, labeled from left to right as Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4, and Stage 5, and there are 3 lines in the graph. The line representing Birth Rate starts at a point on the vertical axis near the top, and across Stage 1 the line first increases and decreases slightly multiple times. In Stage 2, the line increases slightly and then moves horizontally to the right. In Stage 3 the line decreases steeply down and to the right and continues decreasing in Stage 4. In Stage 4, when slightly above the horizontal axis, the line decreases more gradually until it ends at the end of Stage 5. The line representing Death Rate starts at a point on the vertical axis slightly above the start of the Birth Rate line, and across Stage 1 the line first decreases and increases slightly, intersecting the Birth Rate line multiple times. In Stage 2, the line decreases steeply downward and to the right and continues decreasing in Stage 3. Partway through Stage 3, the line begins to decrease more gradually, and in Stages 4 and 5 it moves horizontally to the right. It intersects the Birth Rate line once partway through Stage 4, and continues horizontally until it ends at the end of Stage 5. The line representing Total Population starts on the vertical axis slightly above the horizontal axis, and in Stage 1 it moves horizontally to the right. In Stage 2 the line increases, moving upward and to the right, and intersects the Death Rate line at a point at the end of Stage 2 and beginning of Stage 3. In Stage 3 the line continues to increase upward and to the right, and intersects the Birth Rate line at a point about two thirds of the way up the vertical axis. In Stage 4, the line begins to increase more gradually at first, before decreasing as it moves into Stage 5. It decreases steadily through Stage 5 until it ends at the end of Stage 5, about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis.\" height=\"292\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH926218.g01.png\" width=\"550\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following describes the most likely cause of death for a citizen of a country in stages 4 and 5 of the demographic transition model?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH926218_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Infectious diseases due to poor sanitation</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Degenerative diseases due to old age and lifestyle</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Starvation due to an unstable food supply</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Infectious diseases due to a lack of vaccines and antibiotics</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Reemergence of previously eradicated diseases</p>"],"answer":1}]
