The left side represents Male population and the right side represents Female population. Population is measured along the horizontal axis in percent of total population, and the percents 0 through 18, in increments of 6, are indicated on both sides of the pyramid. The data represented by the pyramid are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The shape of the pyramid is symmetrical about the vertical axis. The largest age group is 0 through 4, peaking at 16 percent for both male and female population. Both male and female populations decrease gradually as they increase in age, narrowing until they end at just above 0 percent for both male and female in the 85 to 89 age group.\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR217696.g01.png\" width=\"600\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The population pyramid shown represents a local area that has been affected by human migration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
