For Country A, the first bar is the longest and extends to 20 on the male side and 18 on the female side. The next bar extends to 15 on the male side and 14 on the female side, and they continuously get shorter until the last few bars which extend to about 1 percent. For Country B, the first bar extends to 6 percent on both sides and the bars get steadily longer to about 9 percent for the fourth and fifth bars. The bars then get steadily shorter until returning to about 6 percent by the 10th bar.
