A key indicates that the following major research and corporate locations are indicated throughout the region: research and teaching hospitals, medical research universities, medical technology equipment manufacturing sites, biotechnology research and development firms, and pharmaceutical manufacturing firms. The following locations are indicated on the map. In Rhode Island, Brown University Medical School, a medical research university, is indicated near Providence, which is 35 miles to the south of downtown Boston. A medical technology equipment manufacturing site, a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm, and two research and teaching hospitals are also indicated in Rhode Island. There are two additional research and teaching hospitals located just west of downtown Boston in Massachusetts. Additionally, in Massachusetts, 10 miles to the north and west of downtown Boston, there are two medical technology equipment manufacturing sites, two pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, and two biotechnology research and development firms located along the Route 128 corridor. In Massachusetts, 35 miles to the west of downtown Boston, the University of Massachusetts Medical School is indicated with a research and teaching hospital, three medical technology equipment manufacturing firms, and a biotechnology research and development firm in the surrounding area. Two medical technology equipment manufacturing firms are located together 25 miles northwest of downtown Boston. An inset map shows the downtown areas of Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, zoomed in. The area north of the Charles River is labeled Cambridge, and two medical research universities, M.I.T. and Harvard University, four biotechnology research and development firms, including Moderna, and a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm are indicated. The area south of the Charles River is labeled Boston. Five medical research universities, Boston University, Harvard Medical School, Northeastern University, Boston University School of Medicine, and Tufts University School of Medicine, as well as six research and teaching hospitals, three biotechnology research and development firms, a medical technology equipment manufacturing firm, and a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm are indicated.\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR734155.g16.svg\" width=\"600\" /><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\"></span>\n\n<p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Source:</span> National Institutes of Health</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The inset map shows the downtown areas of Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">SELECTED TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AREAS</span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span> <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">IN THE MEDICAL FIELD</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup align:left cols:2 colsep:0 rowsep:0\">\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody valign:middle\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row rowsep:1 valign:middle\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1 colsep:1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Category</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2 colsep:1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Product or Service</span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Biotechnology:</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Genetic engineering research</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Biochemistry research</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row rowsep:1\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Diagnostic and testing science</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row rowsep:0\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Gene therapies:</span></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Cancer treatments</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row rowsep:0\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Neurological treatments</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Rare and genetic disease treatments</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">• Antiviral treatments and vaccines (e.g., Moderna)</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Since the 1980s, the northeastern United States has developed into a major global center of high-technology industry that specializes in the medical field</p>\n"}]}]
