The left side of the horizontal axis is labeled Males, and the numbers 5,000,000, 2,500,000, and 0 are indicated from left to right. The right side of the horizontal axis is labeled Females, and the numbers 0, 2,500,000 and 5,000,000 are indicated from left to right. The vertical axis is labeled Age Cohorts and the ages 0 through 99, in ranges of 5 years, are indicated, along with the age range of 100 and over. The data represented in the population pyramid are as follows. All data are approximate. The first age cohort, 0 to 4 years old, shows 2,500,000 males and 2,300,000 females. As the age cohorts increase, the population generally increases until it reaches 4,700,000 males and 4,900,000 females in the 45 to 49 years old age cohort. Moving up the vertical axis, the populations for the next three age cohorts steadily decrease to 3,750,000 males and 3,750,000 females in the 60 to 64 years old age cohort. The next age cohort moving up the vertical axis, 65 to 69 years old, is the second largest age group in the pyramid with 4,500,000 males and 4,500,000 females. Moving up the vertical axis, as the age cohort increases, the populations decrease significantly until they reach near 0 in the 100 and over age cohort.\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR054975.g03.png\" width=\"550\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">ESTIMATED POPULATION TRENDS FOR JAPAN</p>\n</div>\n\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:4\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Year</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Total Population</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Population Age Under 16</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">Population Age 65 and Over</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">2010</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">127,579,145</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">17,546,488</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">29,103,030</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">2020</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">125,507,472</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">15,670,950</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">36,627,469</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">2030</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">120,751,317</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">13,482,155</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">38,886,970</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">2040</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">114,448,328</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">12,474,428</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">42,209,603</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">2050</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">107,209,536</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col3\">11,657,139</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col4\">42,938,885</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Source: United States Census Bureau, International Data Base</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A period of war followed by a baby boom, similar to that of the 1940s and 1950s, is likely to occur within a generation, increasing the youth-aged cohorts.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Modernization of health-care systems may result in improvements in women’s health and pregnancy and result in more children being born, increasing the youth-aged cohorts.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Labor shortages may cause the government to reduce the legal barriers to immigration, and immigrant populations could increase the working-age cohorts.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreasing populations may cause an economic decline, prompting many citizens to emigrate to other more developed countries and decreasing the working-age cohorts.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Production efficiencies gained from computerization and robotization of manufacturing may free parents from long work hours and result in more time to have additional children, increasing the youth-aged cohorts.</p>"],"answer":2}]
