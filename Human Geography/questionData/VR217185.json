A legend indicates that the scale is 1 to 215,000. The Saint Lawrence River is shown flowing west to east across the map, dividing the land into a north portion above the river and a south portion below the river. The south portion has large areas of farmland up to the shore of the river, which is shown by long rectangles that lie perpendicular to the river. On the north portion, fewer farms are indicated, and roads are shown across the area. Two towns are indicated. Portneuf is located at the centermost area of the north portion, and borders the river.
