Two arrows extend from this square and represent axes. From the square, an arrow labeled Distance moves horizontally to the right, and an arrow labeled Cost moves vertically upward. Five concentric rings surround the square. Moving outward from the square, the zones between each of the rings are numbered 1 through 5. A key indicates that 1 represents the central business district (CBD), 2 represents manufacturing and wholesaling, 3 represents low-income residential, 4 represents middle-income residential, and 5 represents high-income residential. Five lines are shown on the Cost-Distance graph. Moving outward along the Distance axis from left to right, the first line intersects with the highest point on the Cost axis. The second line intersects with the second-highest point on the cost axis. The third line intersects with the third-highest point on the Cost axis. The fourth line intersects with the fourth-highest point on the Cost axis. The fifth line intersects with the fifth-highest point on the Cost axis. An arrow labeled Apartment Buildings points to a position on the second line. An arrow labeled Suburban Single-Family Homes points to a position where the fourth and fifth lines intersect.\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH917532.g02.png\" width=\"525\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Transformation of warehouse space in zone 2 of the model into high-income rental properties</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Construction of a large single-family housing development in zone 4 of the model</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gentrification of older housing in selected neighborhoods in zone 3 of the model</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Construction of a large shopping mall in zone 1 of the model</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Mixed-use land development in zone 5 of the model</p>"],"answer":4}]
