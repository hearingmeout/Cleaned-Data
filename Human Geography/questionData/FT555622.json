It decreases to about 750 in 1910, and then goes back up to about 1300 by about 1913. There is a sharp decrease to about 100 around 1918, but then it goes back up to about 800 in the early 1920s. There is a steady decrease to almost 0 by the early 1930s, and it remains close to 0 until the early 1940s when it starts steadily increasing, which continues until it reaches about 750 around 1985.
