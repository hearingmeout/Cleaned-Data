Other transportation elements included the decline of the streetcar system, and a more general multiplier effect that was prompted by transport-driven decentralization of housing and fueled by commercial decentralization.</p><p><strong>Part (b) Housing production</strong></p><p>The major ways in which housing production enhanced suburbanization included a set of cost savings achieved by new forms of organization of production (for example, the large size of developers, ability to purchase large tracts of land, economies of scale, organization of labor into teams, use of subcontracting); the growing affordability of housing due to the use of new methods (for example, prefabrication, on-site assembly, speed of production, new materials); the growing accessibility of such housing due to improved access to finance (for example, government-backed mortgages) and a streamlined purchase system. Other elements included the existence of tax codes that favored construction of new buildings rather than rehabilitation of old buildings (and loan programs that favored new construction rather than repairs/upgrades).</p><p><strong>Part (c) Landscape preferences</strong></p><p>There are a wide range of landscape preferences that supported suburbanization.
