Credit is given for factors that were identified and discussed as causes of (negative) change in the practices of the Green Revolution, as opposed to factors that are negative consequences of the Green Revolution. For example, the assertion \"loss of biodiversity\" alone scores 1 point. If this was followed by a discussion that such loss of biodiversity has been prompted by trends toward monocropping and the long-term effects of pesticide use (i.e., consequences), no second point was awarded.
