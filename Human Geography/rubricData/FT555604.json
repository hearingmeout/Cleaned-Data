From left to right the columns are labeled &quot;Factors and Process or Example&quot;. The entries in the column are as follows.  1. Factors: Groups other than governments try to maintain their distinctive culture by resisting English (folk culture), Process or Example: Elders teaching young people, etc. Native Americans, minority languages in China, Cornish in England. 2. Factors: Devolution (a transfer of power from a higher to a lower level of government) Separatist-regional autonomy. (centrifugal force), Process or Example: Central government allows a minority language found in a region, within a state, that wishes a separate identity to be used e.g., Breton, Welsh, Maori, Inuktitut; OR nationalists or separatists promote the local language as a way to resist the central or national political culture example, Basque. 3. Factors: Government policies to promote unity in multicultural state (centripetal force), Process or Example: The central or national government of a state adopts two or more official languages to reduce the threat of secession, OR examples Belgium, Canada, South Africa, Singapore, India, Nigeria. 4. Factors: Nationalism government policies to increase nationalism in country, Process or Example: Some newly independent states reestablish the indigenous language as a statement of political and cultural independence, OR examples such as Ireland or Gaelic, Israel or Hebrew. 5. Factors: Modern electronic communications or improved communications (but not mass media) can enable small groups of people to stay in touch and reinforce the use of a minority language. Process or Example: The rise of mass personal communications tools such as the telephone, Internet, photocopier, and narrowcasting via cable T V, radio and T V stations, and specialized newspapers and magazines can enable minority groups to resist the power of mass media and maintain their language.\"><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/bf4e1c7ed175c7801bb804d87228002c/original.png?Signature=Fnm3SATFMw3%2Bznai3uJMCvJ8PII%3D&amp;Expires=1628346679&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKS6CKDYKS&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFYaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIAWM0kk5wAjVTe92/NkEuCHIJZO5IxWIVeyevRSUMNPEAiEAzcIPINrIbtDik580GRzjZDAc%2BGrWrPHWN8QiDZiCe7cq%2BgMIbxACGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDGSrT/uSPMoNytrI3irXAw3vcYwqNuwD/cn3%2BQGpcIelCKBS97SK5Z2joxlC5OriZNNMVT/dcxNGO5sDofEz2yYRa8RFJ/%2BKZqYod57e87MpB5nOPNADZy7ictUG8spICbWHLc1A1piaZPeg6JKCghUFZ7GueKPA6Gc04QPo%2BhmmJG6Lpxycy91x1uKQ/maDa8AC0YYRj5ZKfN2hHhsHmG0NOVocK4gMg%2Bz4dQol7bRbhKBdjGkymN2PslvMg6ukfrp9xKE9cnerjnITBOJEs9O8IqnjtFY8Y0/Vo%2BF3Ukho/Zy8Kj5fdQhWspiCbpwlD9YrYMYuE9dsBvSNGCvMNCBDyiwhWGvypVd6BMw%2BQDRNCDWu8engZmBMg4xkWxNPN6aEECD1JAC7qCMAklYCmOxmN60QYWk%2BYKwBhUhSvybMJJDYQTN4WdG%2Bf7Etvvk9JhCAKJyPUKZ5faNjc/doQY560TZPLK/c7lOxiU93GZZREyX5SH5FdGcMWSnpySwLrw%2BJ41cODrzIQNw7CdRxtpxsn2b8kWWxN8IY7lcokkp9gtgGKCUknV0nMSL2AAN5fzeICY6N9ntm0yvnXFasyqxEZrAVdWYXTw6dBLyZd585KMmkzSmCzl%2BgZ1H77aOmbS79ssSv1TCxsbiIBjqlAfDrC%2BjT0OwqMPasFrj43aB7bRPmBYW9/1Tc1FJ/I9jz1MXTu/vFeQYifFd5ERyNTI%2ByIGj89d2Au0%2BrlMSuJ/hO4OEDWtgZSeV8RloYzxrbeCMBFtEHkbkiDj65ZNjfo/2EoNqalrPz6HxXdq8ctwrSazgALdhm2FOo7h4hgUULeVNL5fWihzhBtbyA7mLUUZmHcE0jldnm102CHarDjJ2/Lo5i6w%3D%3D\" alt=\"The table has two columns and two rows.
