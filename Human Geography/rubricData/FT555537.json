From left to right the columns are labeled &quot;Factors (1 point each, maximum 2 points) and Explanations (1 point each, maximum 2 points)&quot;. The entries in the column are as follows.  1. Factors: Increasing demand for organic products has made organic agriculture profitable and led to a growth in organic farming (both large-scale and small-scale). Explanations: Consumers in the U S book alternatives to the industrial products of modern agriculture because of (media driven) concerns about the nutrition and healthiness of commercial agricultural products, Consumers have become wary of the insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) used in agriculture and to produce foodstuffs and have become concerned about related long term health issues, Population of the US is increasing in wealth and is better able to afford (and willing to pay) higher prices for organic products, Buying organic food is an example of conspicuous consumption to display cultural preferences (a green life style), Some consumers switch to organic products because they are concerned about the humane treatment of animals, Households have declined in size and have more disposable income to I on higher-quality (organic) food rather than lower quality spend on higher (nonorganic) food, Better advertising and marketing systems have made organic products more appealing to consumers, thereby increasing the demand for goods and profitability, The demand has increased, aided by the growth of chains of supermarkets dedicated to organic products which has increased profitability and led to the growth of suppliers for those chains. 2. Factors: Shifts in organic agriculture have led to better care for the land (land stewardship, sustainability, environmental concerns). Explanations: As stewards of the land, farmers or consumers with to sustain it in the same state they found it rather than exhaust it or otherwise degrade it by the application of agricultural chemicals, Some consumers witch to organic products because they wish to eat foods that have a less negative impact on the environment (wish to live in greater harmony with nature). 3. Factors: Small farms competing with large scale farms (agribusiness) are forced to shift to more profitable agriculture. Explanations: The economies of scale achieved by large farm operations have kept the retail price of food low. Because small farm operations cannot achieve these economics, they have to either go out of business or shift to more intensive forms of agriculture or supply specialty food for niche markets that bring higher prices and greater profitability example producing higher priced higher quality organic products.\"></p><p><em>Scoring Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>For parts A and B, factor points and explanation points are independent; students can earn one without the other.</p></li><li><p>For both parts, do not award full credit for a “double dip”—e.g., two explanations of demand for organic foods.</p></li></ul>"]}]
