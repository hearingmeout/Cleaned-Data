Chavín and Inka were representative and distinct early and late cultures/styles, respectively (Chavín, c. 1200-500 BCE in the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast; Inka, 1438-1534 CE covering the entire Central Andes), although many other important art-producing cultures existed between them. Similarities within Central Andean cultures can be traced to the influence of three significantly distinct ecosystems in close proximity-the dominant Andes mountains, a narrow desert coast, and the planet's largest rain forest (the Amazon). These environments necessarily play a central role in art, influencing the materials (especially the prominence of camelid fiber and cotton textiles), political systems (coastal diversity, highland impulses toward unification), and overall values (reciprocity, asymmetrical dualism, and travel across long distances). Peoples of the Andes practiced the world's earliest and most persistent artificial mummification (in many forms, from 5500 BCE onward), and almost all art became grave goods for use in the afterlife.","tags":[]},{"id":330078,"external_key":"19.aparhi.0.0.0.0.29","internal_name":"2019-AP-Art-History-Framework-19.aparhi.0.0.0.0.29","label":"CUL-1.A.30","description":"CUL-1.A.30: Complex ties linked coast with highlands; these connections brought forth themes of reciprocity, interdependence, contrast, asymmetry, and dualism.
