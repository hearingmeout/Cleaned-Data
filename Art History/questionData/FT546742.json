The angel is left; a table separates him from the woman, robed in red and seated in front of a bench or pew that is before a hearth. In the background are windows, towels and a brass kettle. The woman is reading a book wrapped in cloth. On the table is another book, velvet sack and pitcher and candlestick. The third panel is a carpenter presumably in an adjacent room drilling wood at a bench.
