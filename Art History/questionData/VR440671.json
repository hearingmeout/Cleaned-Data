Several large rooms are shown on two sides of the plan; some of these rooms are connected and have smaller rooms inside of them. Within the part of the plan not occupied by the rooms, the plan shows a rectangular area. Small, spaced circles are indicated around its periphery. In the photograph, two walls of a room are shown. Columns and entablatures are painted along the walls at varied intervals, creating distinct panels. Within each panel, a rectangular scene is painted. Some of the scenes appear to depict stories, while others show what appear to be exterior views of buildings.\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR440667.g04.png\" width=\"650\" /><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Scala / Art Resource, NY</span></div>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The images show a plan and an interior of the House of the Vettii.</p>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Standard of Ur</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Book of the Dead</span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Tomb of the Triclinium</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Niobides Krater</p>"],"answer":2}]
