At the center of the painting, a man wearing a turban and jewelry is sitting on top of a round, decorated elevated platform with his legs tucked underneath him. Behind the man’s head is a large, gold circle. The circle has a thin, white crescent shape along the bottom edge. Four men are shown standing to the left of the platform forming a line along the bottom edge of the platform, such that their heads are about level with the seated man’s waist. The man at the front of the line has a long, white beard and is wearing a simple white turban and plain clothes. He is holding his hands out to receive a book from the man sitting on the platform. The other three men in line are wearing more elaborate clothes, in which two men are wearing turbans and robes and one man is wearing European clothing. The painting has an ornate, brightly colored, floral border. Persian inscriptions appear inside shapes above and below the scene.\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR440739.g02.png\" width=\"325\" /></p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</span></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Bahram Gur Fights the Karg</span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Court of Gayumars</span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the portrait of Sin Sukju</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Jahangir Preferring a Sufi Shaikh to Kings</span></p>"],"answer":3}]
