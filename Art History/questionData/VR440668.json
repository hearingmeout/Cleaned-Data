Several large rooms are shown on two sides of the plan; some of these rooms are connected and have smaller rooms inside of them. Within the part of the plan not occupied by the rooms, the plan shows a rectangular area. Small, spaced circles are indicated around its periphery. In the photograph, two walls of a room are shown. Columns and entablatures are painted along the walls at varied intervals, creating distinct panels. Within each panel, a rectangular scene is painted.
