The illustration is a collage of old black-and-white photographs. The horizon line is at 45 degree angle, with the images displayed upward to the right. A disproportionately large photograph of the head and shoulders of a bearded man with a balding head, who appears to be shouting, is in the upper right-hand corner. Below the man, photographs of marching crowds and rallies are shown. Some people in the crowds are holding flags and banners with Russian text. A red number 5 is shown near the center left of the collage, above the image of the crowds. An image of a high voltage powerline, also in red, is shown in the background behind the bearded man.\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR733820.g05.png\" width=\"450\" /><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Fine Art Images/ age fotostock</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
