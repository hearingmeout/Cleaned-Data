The roof is unusual in that the left and right halves are not connected but separate halves. Behind the two halves is a broad, double-wide chimney that spans both halves of the house. There is no front door per se but a small interior courtyard space. Presumably an entrance is on one or both sides of a wall that conceals the passageway. The left side of the house has two square windows; one large the other small. The right side has a long rectangular window that runs more than half the length of the annex. The house is notable for its lack of adornment and its plain gray color.\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/dd1787f81b07d228644f36648bbbd293/original.png\" width=\"500\" /></p>\n\n<p><sup>LEFT: Used by permission</sup></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"An office building approximately 12 stories high is shown. The material is white stone or concrete and adorned with different motifs on the two facades visible. The first facade has strips painted terracotta, topped by decorative medallions. The visual effect is to create a stylized ribbon running down three quarters of the building in four strips. The other facade features a trapazoid of mauve and black. Below that two more ornaments that look like wall sconces. Below them are strips of terracotta against a blue field.\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/cbc89384292d95c1bc9001dd02c2a696/original.png\" width=\"400\" /></p>\n\n<p><sup>RIGHT: © Edifice / The Bridgeman Art Library</sup></p>\n"}]}]
