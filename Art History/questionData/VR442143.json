The woman is wearing a white bonnet and a simple dress, which has muted colors of dark yellow, blue, and dark orange. Her sleeves are rolled up and her forearms are bare. The woman has fair skin and a stocky build. The room has faded, white walls and a small window on the left wall from which sunlight pours through onto the woman. The room is mostly empty except for a small foot stove on the floor, a couple of baskets hanging by the window, and a small table next to a wall. A blue cloth covers the table, which has a clay bowl, a dark blue jug, and several loaves of bread on it. The woman pours milk from an earthenware jug into the clay bowl. Her head tilts downward with her gaze concentrating on the stream of milk.\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR442143.g04.png\" width=\"300\" /><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands/Bridgeman Images</span></div>\n"}]}]
