At the top of the cross are two figures tormenting or celebrating his death.  Two others on either side are carrying the body down ladders.  At the foot of the ladders are weeping women and a man looking away with his face buried in his hands.  The forms are flat and almost geometric but not abstract; facial expression and mood are discernible; ribs and muscles distinct.  The cross is terracotta colored; Christ's body is discolored, almost jaundice.
