The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are indicated on the x axis. The numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of two line segments and a curve. An open circle and a closed circle are also included in the graph. The first line segment begins on the y axis at 2, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 1 comma 1. The curve begins where the first line segment ends, and moves steeply upward and to the right, before leveling off as it approaches an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 3. Directly below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. The second line segment begins from the open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 3, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 3 comma 5.\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR187060.g09.png\" width=\"250\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
