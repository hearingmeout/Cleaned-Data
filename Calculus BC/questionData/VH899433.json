The first curve opens upward, and begins at the origin. It moves gradually upward and to the right at first before becoming almost vertical. At this point, the curve turns and moves upward and to the left until it ends on the y axis, high above the origin. The second curve opens downward, and begins at the origin. It moves steeply upward and to the right briefly, before leveling off at a point that is to the right of the y axis, but to the left of the first curve. It then moves downward and to the right and intersects the first curve. It continues gradually downward and to the right, until it becomes almost vertical near the end of the x axis, and ends at a point on the x axis, far to the right of the origin. The region that is bounded by the first curve from below, and bounded by the second curve from above, is shaded.\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH899433.g03.png\" width=\"165\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure above shows the graphs of the polar curves <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r equals, 1.25 theta\"><math alttext=\"r equals, 1.25 theta\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1.25</mn><mi>θ</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r equals, the cosine cubed of, open parenthesis, 2 theta, close parenthesis, plus 1\"><math alttext=\"r equals, the cosine cubed of, open parenthesis, 2 theta, close parenthesis, plus 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mi>cos</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>θ</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"0 less than or equal to theta, less than or equal to pi over 2\"><math alttext=\"0 less than or equal to theta, less than or equal to pi over 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>θ</mi><mo>≤</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
