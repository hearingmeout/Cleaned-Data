The numbers 1 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 1 through 3, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of three curves and two line segments. The first curve begins at the origin, and moves gradually upward and to the right at first before becoming steeper and ending at an open circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 1. Above this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 2. The first line segment begins at this closed circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 2 comma 1, and ends at a second open circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 0. Above this open circle is a second closed circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 1. The second line segment begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 0, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 4 comma 1. The second curve begins where the second line segment ends, and moves gradually downward and to the right at first before becoming steeper. It crosses the x axis just to the left of x equals 5 and becomes almost vertical until it reaches the bottom edge of the visible portion of the coordinate plane as it approaches x equals 5. The third curve begins just to the right of x equals 5 at the top edge of the visible portion of the plane, and moves steeply downward and to the right until it ends at the point with approximate coordinates 6 comma 1.3.\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH902625.g01.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of a function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown in the figure above.
