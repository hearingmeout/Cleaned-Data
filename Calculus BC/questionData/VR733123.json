The numbers negative 1 and 1 are indicated on both the x and y axes. The graph is a curve that begins just below the x axis, far to the left of the y axis, and moves gradually upward and to the right at first. It crosses the x axis to the right of negative 1 and continues upward and to the right until it reaches a point above the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. From here, the graph moves gradually downward and to the right, crosses the y axis above the origin and below 1, and ends at a point above the x axis, to the right of the y axis. It then moves more steeply upward and to the right until it ends high above 1 on the x axis, and far to the right of the y axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR733123.g04.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows the graph of the differentiable function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>f</mi></math></span></span> for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"negative 1 less than x, less than 1\"><math alttext=\"negative 1 less than x, less than 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math></span></span>.
