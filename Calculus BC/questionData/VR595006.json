The numbers 1 through 9, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. Four points labeled A, B, C, and D are indicated on the curve. The behavior of the curve is as follows. The curve begins on the y axis, just above the origin, and moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches a local maximum point A at x equals 2, about one third of the way up the y axis. It then moves downward and to the right, passes through point B at x equals 3, slightly below point A, and reaches a local minimum. It then moves upward and to the right, and reaches point C at x equals approximately 4.5, just to the right of the minimum, and slightly below point B. It continues gradually upward and to the right until it reaches point D at x equals approximately 7.5, near the top of the y axis, just to the left of a second local maximum. It moves downward and to the right until it ends at a point at x equals 9, slightly below point D. Four dashed line segments are drawn. The first dashed line segment is horizontal and is tangent to the curve at the point A. The second dashed line segment starts on the y axis at the leftmost point on the curve, slants upward and to the right, passes through point B, and ends at x equals 9, at the rightmost point on the curve. The third dashed line segment is parallel with the second dashed line segment and is tangent to the curve at the point C. The fourth dashed line segment is also parallel with the second dashed line segment and is tangent to the curve at the point D.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR595006.g05.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> shown in the figure is continuous on the closed interval <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"open bracket, 0 comma 9, close bracket\"><math alttext=\"open bracket, 0 comma 9, close bracket\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow></math></span></span> and differentiable on the open interval <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"open parenthesis, 0 comma 9, close parenthesis\"><math alttext=\"open parenthesis, 0 comma 9, close parenthesis\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></span></span>.
