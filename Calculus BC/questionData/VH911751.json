The first line segment begins on the vertical axis at 4, and moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates 5 comma 6. It continues upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 10 comma 8. The second line segment begins where the first line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right.
