The numbers negative 3 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 3 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of four curves and one line segment. Two open circles and two closed circles are included in the graph. The first curve begins to the left of the y axis, just below a dashed horizontal line at y equals 1. It moves very gradually downward and to the right at first, before moving more steeply downward and to the right. It crosses through the origin, and continues downward becoming almost vertical as it approaches a dashed vertical line at approximately x equals one half. It ends at the bottom edge of the coordinate plane, just to the left of x equals approximately one half. The second curve begins just to the right of the dashed vertical line at x equals approximately one half, high above the x axis. It moves steeply downward and to the right until it ends at an open circle at the point with approximate coordinates 1.5 comma 1.5. The line segment begins at this open circle, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at a second open circle at the point with approximate coordinates 2.5 comma 1.5. Directly above this open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2.5 comma 2. The third curve begins at this closed circle, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 3.5 comma 3. The fourth curve begins at this closed circle, and moves downward and to the right. It begins to level off as it approaches the dashed horizontal line at y equals 1, and ends just above the dashed line.\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH927189.g04.png\" width=\"285\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
