The second line segment begins where the first ends, and moves downward and to the right. It crosses the horizontal axis at negative 3.5 and ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates negative 3 comma negative 2. The third line segment begins where the second ends, and moves upward and to the right. It crosses the horizontal axis at negative 2 and ends at a closed circle on the vertical axis at 4.
