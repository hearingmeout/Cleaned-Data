The numbers 1 through 8 are indicated on both the x and y axes of each coordinate plane. The graph of f consists of two curves and a line segment. One open circle and one closed circle are included in the graph. The first curve begins above the x axis, just to the left of the origin, and moves upward and to the right. It crosses the y axis at 5, and continues upward until becoming almost vertical as it approaches a dashed line at x equals 1. It continues upward outside of the plane. The second curve begins to the right of the dashed line at x equals 1, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 2 comma 7, and the point with coordinates 3 comma 5, and reaches an open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 3. Directly below the open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 1. The curve begins again at the open circle, and moves downward and to the right, until it ends just above the x axis at x equals 7. The line segment begins at this point and moves horizontally to the right.  The graph of g consists of two curves. A closed circle is included in the graph. The first curve begins above the x axis, just to the left of the origin, and moves upward and to the right. It crosses the y axis just below 5, and continues upward until becoming almost vertical as it approaches a dashed line at x equals 2. It continues upward outside of the plane. The second curve begins to the right of the dashed line at x equals 2, and moves downward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 3 comma 6, and passes through a closed circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 5. The curve begins to level off as it approaches y equals 4.\" height=\"275\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH926932.g05.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graphs of the functions <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"g\"><math alttext=\"g\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> are shown above.
