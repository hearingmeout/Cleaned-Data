The numbers negative 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers 1 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of two curves and three line segments. Two open circles and three closed circles are included in the graph. The first curve begins at x equals negative 1, and moves upward and to the right, crossing the y axis between 1 and 2. The curve becomes increasingly steeper as it approaches x equals 0.5, until it reaches the top edge of the visible portion of the coordinate plane. A vertical dashed line is drawn at x equals 0.5. The second curve begins just to the right of x equals 0.5 at the top edge of the visible portion of the coordinate plane, and moves steeply downward and to the right. It begins to level off as it ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 1.5 comma 1. Below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with approximate coordinates 1.5 comma 0.5. The first line segment begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates 1.5 comma 1, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at a second closed circle at the point with coordinates 2.5 comma 3. Below this closed circle is a second open circle at the point with coordinates 2.5 comma 2. The second line segment begins at this open circle at the point with coordinates 2.5 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at a third closed circle at the point with coordinates 3.5 comma 1. The third line segment begins at this closed circle at the point with coordinates 3.5 comma 1, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 5 comma 2.5.\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH903123.g02.png\" width=\"285\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
