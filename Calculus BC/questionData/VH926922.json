The numbers 1 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated on both axes. The graph consists of four line segments. Four open circles and three closed circles are included in the graph. The graph begins with an open circle on the y axis at 1. The first line segment begins at this open circle, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. Directly above this closed circle, is an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 2. The second line segment begins at this open circle, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2. Directly above this closed circle, is an open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 3. The third line segment begins at this open circle, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 6 comma 3. Directly above this closed circle, is an open circle at the point with coordinates 6 comma 4.
