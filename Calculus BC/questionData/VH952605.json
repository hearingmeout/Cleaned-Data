The numbers negative 4 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x and y axes. The graph consists of two curves. Two open circles and one closed circle are also included in the graph. The first curve begins below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right briefly before leveling off, and reaching a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 3.7 comma negative 1.4. The curve then moves downward and to the right until it levels off, and reaches a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 0.5 comma negative 2.5. It then moves upward and to the right, crosses the y axis at approximately negative 2.4, and ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma negative 2. Above this open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma negative 1. Above this closed circle is a second open circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 2. The second curve begins at the open circle with coordinates 1 comma 2, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at a point just above the x axis, and to the right of x equals 4.\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH952605.g04.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown in the figure above.
