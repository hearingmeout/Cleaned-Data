The graph consists of four line segments. The first line segment begins on the vertical axis at the point with coordinates 0 comma 1800, and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1800. The second line segment begins where the first line segment ends, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2400. The third line segment begins where the second line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 6 comma 1400.
