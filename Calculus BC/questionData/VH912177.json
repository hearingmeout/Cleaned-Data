The numbers -2 through 2 are indicated on both axes. The slope field is symmetric over the y axis and symmetric over the x axis. All of the segments on the y axis are horizontal and have slope 0. There are no segments drawn on the x axis. As x increases in the first quadrant, the slopes of the segments in each row decrease from 0 on the y axis and become steeper in the negative direction. As y increases in the first quadrant, the slopes of the segments in each row decrease and become steeper in the negative direction. Because the slope field is symmetric over the y axis, the slopes in the second quadrant have the opposite behavior of the slopes in the first quadrant. As x decreases in the second quadrant, the slopes of the segments in each row increase from 0 on the y axis and become steeper in the positive direction. As y increases in the second quadrant, the slopes of the segments in each row increase and become steeper in the positive direction. Because the slope field is symmetric over the x axis, the slopes of the segments in the third quadrant have the opposite behavior of the slopes of the segments in the second quadrant. The slopes of the segments in the fourth quadrant have the opposite behavior of the slopes of the segments in the first quadrant.\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH912177.g01.png\" width=\"240\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Shown above is the slope field for which of the following differential equations?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH912177_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, negative, open parenthesis, x plus y, close parenthesis\"><math alttext=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, negative, open parenthesis, x plus y, close parenthesis\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, negative x y\"><math alttext=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, negative x y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, the negative of x squared, times y\"><math alttext=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, the negative of x squared, times y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><msup><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, the negative of, the fraction x over y\"><math alttext=\"the derivative of y, with respect to x, equals, the negative of, the fraction x over y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>y</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":1}]
