The horizontal axis is labeled t, and the numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled v of t, and the numbers negative 20 through 20, in increments of 10, are indicated. The curve begins at the origin, and moves upward and to the right, until it reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 1 comma 20. It then moves downward and to the right, until it reaches a local minimum on the horizontal axis at the point with coordinates 2 comma 0. It then moves upward and to the right, until it reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 2.5 comma 5. It then moves downward and to the right, crossing the horizontal axis at the point with coordinates 3 comma 0, and reaches a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates 3.5 comma negative 10. The curve then moves upward and to the right, passing through the horizontal axis at the point with coordinates 4 comma 0, and reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 4.3 comma 10.
