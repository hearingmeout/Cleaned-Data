It moves almost horizontally to the right at first, crossing the y axis, before moving downward and to the right, and ending at an open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2. Directly below this open circle, is a closed circle on the x axis at 4. Directly below this closed circle, is an open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma negative 1.
