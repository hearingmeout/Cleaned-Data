[{"id":"FT573645","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph in the x y plane and is titled Graph of f. The x axis has 14 tick marks to the right of the origin. The tickmarks from 2 to 14 are labeled, in increments of 2. The y axis has 2 tick marks below and 4 tick marks above the origin labeled, from bottom to top, negative 2 to 4. From left to right, the graph begins with a line segment that starts in quadrant 3 and moves straight up and to the right crossing through the origin, continuing up until it reaches the coordinates one comma one. The graph then curves down and to the right until it reaches an open dot at the coordinates 3 comma zero. The curve then bends up and to the right until it ends at a closed dot at the coordinates 7 comma 4. A second curve begins below the end of the first curve, at an open dot at the coordinates 7 comma 1. This curve bends down and to the right to an open dot at the coordinates 10 comma zero point 5, and then continues down and to the right, until it ends just above a point to the right of 14 on the x axis. There is one closed dot at the coordinates 10 comma one.  \" height=\"263\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/03b50ef64250d19133381980d44f1593/original.png\" width=\"295\" /></p>\n\n<p>The graph of the function <em>f</em> is shown above.
