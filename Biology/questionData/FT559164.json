Within plaque, the outer layers contain high levels of oxygen and the layers closest to the tooth contain low levels of oxygen. The surface of the tooth is covered in a hard layer of enamel, which can be dissolved under acidic conditions. When the enamel breaks down, the bacteria in plaque can extract nutrients from the tooth and cause cavities. </p><p></p><p>Certain types of bacteria (e.g.,<em> Streptococcus mutans</em>) thrive in the innermost anaerobic layers of the plaque and are associated with cavities. Other types of bacteria (<em>Streptococcus sanguinis</em>) compete with <em>S. mutans</em> but are unable to thrive in acidic environments. </p>"}]}]
