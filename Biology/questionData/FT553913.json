Ten fish were each tested once, one at a time. To begin the experiment, a fish was removed from a stock tank (maintained at 22<sup>o</sup>C) and placed in the temperature-gradient tank drawn below. After the fish had spent 30 minutes in the temperature-gradient tank, the section where the fish was located was recorded. Additional observations were recorded every 5 minutes, for a total of 7 observations per fish. A summary of the combined data for all 10 fish appears below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A figure of a temperature gradient tank with five sections. The tank is a long tank that starts at 2 degrees Celsius at one end of the tank and 27 degrees Celsius at the other end. Section A has temperatures from 2 to 7 degrees Celsius, section B is next from 7 to 12 degrees Celsius, section C is from 12 to 17 degrees Celsius, section D is from 17 to 22 degrees Celsius, and section E is from 22 to 27 degrees Celsius. In section A there were 9 fish, section B has 11 fish, section C had 34 fish, section D had 12 fish, and section E had 4 fish.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/dddcad66acdd33d4bfa541ce83e055b2/original.png\"></p>\n"}]}]
