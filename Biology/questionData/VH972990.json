Arrows point from this molecule to the next part of the diagram in which the two strands are shown separately, with their 5 prime and 3 prime ends in the identical positions as in the original molecule. An arrow that is labeled DNA Synthesis points from each of the two single strands to a new double stranded DNA molecule. The two new molecules are labeled Copies of the Original DNA Molecule. Asterisks are shown by all bases on the strand of each new molecule that is complementary to the single strand. The 5 prime and 3 prime ends of each strand are shown, and the two strands are in opposite orientations, as in the original molecule.\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH972990.g07.png\" width=\"340\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
