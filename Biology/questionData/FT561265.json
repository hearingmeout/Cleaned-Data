The horizontal axis is labeled Substrate Concentration, open brace, S, close brace, and the vertical axis is labeled Initial Rate of Reaction. A solid line begins at the origin of the graph, curves steeply up and to the right, before decreasing in slope, and continues gradually up and to the right, and ends at the top right corner of the graph. A dashed line moves from the center of the vertical axis horizontally to the right, intersects the solid line, then moves vertically down, and ends when it reaches the horizontal axis. A Roman numeral one labels the portion of the solid line between the origin and the intersection with the dashed line. A second dashed line begins near the top of the vertical axis, and moves horizontally to the right, and ends when it intersects the end of the solid line in the upper right corner of the graph.
