The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and the values 1 through 4 are indicated at unequal intervals. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Concentration. On the graph, there is a solid curve labled Oxygen, a dashed curve labeled Cyanobacteria, and a dotted curve labeled Decomposers.   The solid curve begins on the vertical axis, and moves horizontally to the right. After a time of approximately 1 point 2 5, the curve moves steeply upward, and reaches its maximum at a time of approximately 2. At this point, the curve moves downward and to the right, steeply at first and then more steadily as it approaches the horizontal axis, and ends at approximately a time of 4.The dashed cuve begins on the vertical axis, below the solid curve, and moves horizontally to the right. After a time of approximately 1, the curve moves steeply upward, and reaches its maximum at about a time of 1 point 7 5. This maximum is lower than the maximum of the solid line. At this point, the curve moves steeply downward and to the right until a time of approximately 2 point 5. The curve then slopes very gradually downward and to the right until ends at a time of approximately 4 point 5, well above the solid curve.  The dotted curve begins on the vertical axis, below both the solid and dashed cuves, and moves horizontally to the right. After a time of approximately 2, the curve moves steeply upward, and reaches its maximum at about a time of 2 point 5. This maximum is slightly higher than the maximum of the solid line. At this point, the curve moves downward and to the right, steeply at first and then more steadily until it ends at a time of approximately 4 point 5, slightly below the dashed curve.\" height=\"251\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d01432040b2be23161e522190077c27c/original.png\" width=\"487\" /></p>\n\n<p>Figure 1. Characteristics of a pond community over time</p>\n\n<p><em>Microcystis aeruginosis</em> is a freshwater photosynthetic cyanobacterium. When temperatures increase and nutrients are readily available in its pond habitat, <em>M. aeruginosis</em> undergoes rapid cell division and forms an extremely large, visible mass of cells called an algal bloom. <em>M. aeruginosis</em> has a short life span and is decomposed by aerobic bacteria and fungi. <strong>Identify</strong> the metabolic pathway <u>and</u> the organism that is primarily responsible for the change in oxygen level in the pond between times I and II AND between times III and IV.</p>\n"}]
