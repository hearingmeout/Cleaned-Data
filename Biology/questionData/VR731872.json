[{"id":"VR731872","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<div><div class=\"stimulus_reference\"><div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a model of the activation of a cyclin C D K complex composed of a cyclin and a C D K. The cyclin is represented by an oval that is touching a square representing the C D K. The figure shows two representations of an inactive cyclin – C D K complex followed one representation of an active cyclin – C D K complex. The figure also includes three enzymes, numbered 1 through 3. A key indicates that a P in a circle represents a phosphate transferred by enzyme 1, and a P in a triangle represents a phosphate transferred by enzyme 2. An arrow points from Enzyme 1 with a P in a circle to Enzyme 1 alone. A second arrow points from Enzyme 2 with a P in a triangle to Enzyme 2 alone. Both Enzyme arrows touch arrows pointing from the first inactive cyclin – C D K complex to the second inactive cyclin – C D K complex. There are no P symbols attached to the first inactive cyclin – C D K complex, but both a P in a circle and a P in a triangle are attached to the C D K of the second inactive cyclin – C D K complex. An arrow points from the second inactive cyclin – C D K complex to the active cyclin – C D K complex. Enzyme 3 is represented above this arrow, and an arrow that points to a P in a triangle branches off this arrow between the second inactive cyclin – C D K complex and the active cyclin – C D K complex. A P in a triangle is the only P attached to the C D K of the active cyclin – C D K complex\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR731872.g03.svg\"/><p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
