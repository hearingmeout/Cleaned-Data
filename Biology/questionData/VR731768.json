Male mice mark the area in which they live with their scent by leaving urine wherever they walk. There are two classes of proteins that are found in mouse urine, major urinary proteins (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M U P s\"><math alttext=\"M U P s\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MUPs</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>) and major histocompatibility complex (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M H C\"><math alttext=\"M H C\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>MHC</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>) proteins. The proteins provide a unique scent for each mouse.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In an experiment, wild male mice were kept isolated in separate cages and their urination patterns were recorded. They were then combined into a single cage that was divided into two compartments by a mesh screen, and again their urination patterns were recorded (Figure 1).</p><div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a diagram of urination patterns in three cages in which two male mice were kept.

The Combined cage is double the size of the Isolated cages and is divided down the middle by a mesh screen with Male 1, Dominant on the one side and Male 2, Subordinate on the other side. It shows a random urination pattern throughout Male 1’s half of the cage, but in Male 2’s half of the cage, all urine is in one corner on the far side of the cage from the screen.\" height=\"278\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR731764.g06.svg\" width=\"388\"/><p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
