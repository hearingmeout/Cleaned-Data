The area above the phospholipid bilayer is labeled Outside of the Cell. The area below the phospholipid bilayer is labeled Inside of the Cell. A protein labeled T R P V 1 has six transmembrane regions, represented by ovals, and two intracellular ends and is embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. From left to right, the diagram of T R P V 1 shows an H 2 N terminus connected inside the cell by a line to the first oval. The first oval is connected by a line outside the cell to a second oval in the phospholipid bilayer. The second oval is connected by a line inside the cell to a third oval in the phospholipid bilayer. The third oval is connected by a line outside the cell to a fourth oval in the phospholipid bilayer. The fourth oval is connected by a line inside the cell to a fifth oval in the phospholipid bilayer. The fifth oval is not immediately adjacent to the sixth oval but is connected by a line outside the cell that crosses halfway into the phospholipid bilayer and back out again before attaching to the sixth oval in the phospholipid bilayer.

The diagram shows a horizonal phospholipid bilayer labeled Cell Membrane. A representation of the T R P V 1 protein as described in Figure 1 is shown in the membrane. T R P V 1 has six transmembrane regions, represented by ovals, and two intracellular ends and is embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Ovals one through five are close to one another and oval six is further away but attached to oval 5 by an extracellular region of the protein. In this figure, there is a gap in the continuity of the phospholipid bilayer between ovals five and six. A black triangle is shown in the middle of the sixth oval and is labeled Capsaicin Bound to its Binding Site. Small black circles that are shown above, below, and in the gap in the cell membrane represent ions and are labeled C a with a plus two charge. An arrow that points through the gap in the cell membrane from the circles on the outside to the circles on the inside of the cell is labeled C a with a plus two charge influx. An arrow indicating activation points from the C a with a plus two charge ions inside the cell to the label Calcineurin. Calcineurin is positioned above an arrow that indicates activation and that points from transcription factor N F A T 2 with a phosphate group attached to N F A T without a phosphate group. A label beneath the arrow says dephosphorylates. Another arrow indicates that N F A T moves from the cytosol into the nucleus, where it is shown bound to D N A. Immediately to the right of N F A T 2 on the D N A, a line with a perpendicular bar indicating inhibition of expression leads to the label A T F 3 that is positioned slightly above the D N A. A second line with a perpendicular bar indicating inhibition of activity leads from A T F 3 to the label p G o G.
