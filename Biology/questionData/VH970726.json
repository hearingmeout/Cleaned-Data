A study was conducted to determine how certain cell proteins were made in a plant cell using a phytochrome. Figures 1 and 2 represent findings from the study.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram of the phytochrome response to red light. In the first part of the diagram, inactive phytochrome P r in the cytoplasm becomes active phytochrome P f r that enters the nucleus in the presence of red light. The next part of the diagram shows that P f r is bound to P I F 3 that is bound to a G Box Promoter and that P f r is also bound to a Transcriptional Complex that is bound to a T A T A box on DNA. A bent arrow above a shaded rectangle to the right of the T A T A box points to the right and is labeled Transcription. An arrow points from the shaded box to a circle labeled M Y B. In the last part of the diagram, the M Y B labeled circle is bound to another Promoter and also contacts a Transcriptional Complex that is bound to a T A T A box on DNA. A bent arrow above a shaded rectangle to the right of the T A T A box points to the right and is labeled Transcription. An arrow points from the shaded box to the label Cell Proteins.\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH970726.g06.png\" width=\"450\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.

In the first part of the diagram, active P f r in the cytoplasm becomes inactive P r in the presence of far red light.

A label above a shaded rectangle to the right of the T A T A box reads No Transcription. A second label below the shaded box reads M Y B Type Transcription Factor. The last part of the diagram shows another Promoter and a T A T A box on DNA. Nothing is bound to the promoter, and a Transcriptional Complex is bound to the T A T A box.
