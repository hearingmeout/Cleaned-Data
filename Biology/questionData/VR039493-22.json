There is no heading for column 1. The species names provided for the five rows in Column 1 are as follows: “Human,” “Gorilla,” “Orangutan,” “Gibbon,” and “Chimpanzee.” The heading for column 2 is “Human.” The heading for column 3 is “Gorilla.” The heading for column 4 is “Orangutan.” The heading for column 5 is “Gibbon.” The heading for column 6 is “Chimpanzee.” There are 5 rows of data in the table.  Data are given for pairings of species, as follows. Note that data are not provided in the table for duplicate pairings of species, or when a species is paired with itself. Row 1: Human and Gorilla, 10.3; Human and Orangutan, 16.1; Human and Gibbon, 18.1; Human and Chimpanzee, 8.8.
