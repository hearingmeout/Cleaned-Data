Scientists have determined that when <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span> is hunting for food, the worms have different patterns of movement that depend on the location and quality of the food source. Scientists hypothesized that <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span> might be attracted to certain chemicals produced by <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Pseudomonas</span>. They tested this hypothesis by placing 100 <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span> in the center of each of a series of petri dishes containing a layer of agar over which the worms could move. A drop of a test chemical diluted in ethanol was placed at one edge of each dish and an equal-sized drop of ethanol was placed at the opposite edge of the dish. The scientists determined the number of worms to reach each spot over a period of time.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> why the location and quality of food sources in the soil are sometimes likely to stimulate random movements by <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span>, but at other times are more likely to stimulate directed movements.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR002086","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Justify</span> the scientists’ use of two different spots on each petri dish and the counting of worms at each of the two spots.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR002086","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:C part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"C\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Under harsh environmental conditions, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span> produces a pheromone, a complex of molecules that affects other <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">C. elegans</span>.
