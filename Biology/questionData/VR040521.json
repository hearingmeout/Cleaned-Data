The vertical axis is labeled “Acetyl-Co A, in micromoles”, and the numbers 0 through 70, in increments of 10, are indicated. Three lines of data are shown on the graph, labeled Condition 1, Condition 2, and Condition 3. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line labeled Condition 1 begins at the origin and moves upwards and to the right at a constant rate until reaching the point 60 seconds comma 60 micromoles, after which it begins to level off to move horizontally to the right at the point 70 seconds comma 65 micromoles. It continues to move horizontally until it ends at the point 90 seconds comma 65 micromoles. The line labeled Condition 2 begins at the origin and curves gradually upwards and to the right, passing through the point 50 seconds comma 30 micromoles, after which it curves even more gradually upwards and to the right, ending at the point 90 seconds comma 38 micromoles. The line labeled Condition 3 begins at the origin and moves steeply upwards and to the right until reaching the point 20 seconds comma 55 micromoles, after which it begins to curve upwards and to the right, leveling off at 30 seconds comma 65 micromoles, and moving horizontally to the right until ending at the point 90 seconds comma 65 micromoles.\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR040504.g04.png\" width=\"285\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Figure 1.
