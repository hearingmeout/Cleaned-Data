His work has focused on hydrothermal vents, which are cracks in the ocean floor. Water heated by molten rock beneath the crust escapes from these vents at very high temperatures, producing hot, high‑pressure environments at the vents on the ocean floor.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In order to provide evidence that these vents may be areas where life originated, which of the following states a null hypothesis Hazen might have used to begin his research?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH982068_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Organic molecules were transported to the hydrothermal vents via a meteorite, thereby seeding them with precursors for more complex molecules.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The temperatures and pressures found in hydrothermal vents resemble conditions described in currently accepted origins of life hypotheses.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Organic waste sinking to the ocean floor would have used the unique hot water environment as an energy source to begin manufacturing food.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Chemosynthetic organisms can best develop in the hydrothermal environment, manufacturing nutrients for other living things to feed on.</p>"],"answer":1}]
