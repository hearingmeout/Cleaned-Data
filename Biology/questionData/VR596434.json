Researchers studying a population of trees in the forest hypothesize that warming will negatively impact the evolutionary fitness of many of the trees. The researchers also hypothesize that warming will shift the range of the population further north to cooler habitats.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> the way the evolutionary fitness of an individual tree is measured.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR596434","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) The range shift of the tree population may result in the fragmentation of the population into several smaller, isolated populations. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Explain</span> how the fragmentation may result in speciation.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR596434","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:C part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"C\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Recent research suggests that the range in which trees can grow is due in large part to their symbiotic relationships with soil microbes that are sensitive to temperature. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Predict</span> the effects on a population of microbes if the average temperature in an area increases above the temperature at which <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">most</span> of the microbes are able to successfully reproduce.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR596434","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:D part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"D\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(d) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Justify</span> your prediction in part (c) using evidence from biological principles.</p></div>\n"}]
