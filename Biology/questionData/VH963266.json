The model begins with Blood Vessel Injury stimulating the conversion of Inactive Clotting Factors to Activated Clotting Factors. The Activated Clotting Factors in turn activate the conversion of Prothrombin to Thrombin. Arrows indicate that Thrombin helps stimulate the conversion of Inactive Clotting Factors to Activated Clotting Factors and also activates the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.
