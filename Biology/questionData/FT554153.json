In a certain plant species, stem trichome density is genetically determined.</p>\n\n<p><br>\nTo investigate variation in stem trichome density within the plant species, a student counted the number of trichomes on the stems of six plants in each of three different populations. The student used the data to calculate the mean trichome density (numbers of hairs per square centimeter) for each population. The results are provided in the table below.<br>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 9 columns and 4 rows.
