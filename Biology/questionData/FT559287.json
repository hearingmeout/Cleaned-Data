Cyanobacteria are found in marine microbial mats that include many species of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms that can participate in mutualistic symbiotic relationships. One recently discovered species of cyanobacteria, UCYN-A, lacks the genes that encode ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo), components of photosystem II, and the Krebs cycle. UCYN-A contains genes enabling nitrogen fixation, which allows the enzymatic conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to biologically available nitrogen compounds such as nitrate. Within the microbial community there is relatively little available nitrogen. The majority of organisms in the microbial mat cannot fix nitrogen. </p>"}]}]
