Each colony was composed of a population of yeast that originated from a single yeast cell that had reproduced asexually to form a population of millions of yeast clones. That plate was used to produce replicate plates of yeast colonies. Each replicate plate was a mirror image of the original cultures, so each colony could be subjected to each treatment group. The replicate plates contained different media as follows.</p></div></div>\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:1\">\n<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Robust media: Contains all nutrients required by yeast in excess amounts</li>\n<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Complete media: Contains all nutrients at a level promoting exponential growth at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"r sub max\"><math alttext=\"r sub max\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>max</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow></msub></mrow></math></span></span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Minimal media: Nutrients available at a low level, allowing growth, but stressing the yeast colonies</li>\n<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Deficient media: Nutrient content less than what is needed to sustain growth, extreme stress on yeast colonies</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">Eight replica plates were made, two plates of each media, and all plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 hours.
