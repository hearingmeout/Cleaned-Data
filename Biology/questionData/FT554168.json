In a study of selection, male and female guppies from genetically diverse populations were collected from different mountain streams and placed together in an isolated environment containing no predators. The study population was maintained for several generations in the isolated area before being separated into two groups. One group was moved to an artificial pond containing a fish predator, while a second group was moved to an artificial pond containing no predators. The two groups went through several generations in their new environments. At different times during the experiment, the mean number of spots per adult male guppy was determined as shown in the figure below. Vertical bars in the figure represent two standard errors of the mean (SEM).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph in the first quadrant. The horizontal axis is labeled Time open parenthesis month close parenthesis and the numbers appearing on it are from zero to 20, in increments of 2.The vertical axis is labeled Mean Number of Spots per Adult Male Guppy and begins with two tildes, the numbers appearing on it, from bottom to top, are from 8 to 14 in increments of one. An arrow is inside the figure on the horizontal axis at position 6 and carries a label: Population Separated into Groups.

The solid line begins at coordinate zero comma 10 and has vertical bars that extend between 8 and 12. The solid line moves to 11 point 8 comma 6 which has vertical bars extending between 11 point 5 and 12 point 1. The broken line descends from the solid line at this point to 10 point 5 comma 10 with vertical bars extending between 10 point 2 and 10 point 8 then 9 point 3 comma 20 with error bars extending between 9 and 9 point 6. The solid lines ascends from 11 point 8 comma 6 to 12 point 4 comma 10 with vertical bars extending between 12 point 2 and 12 point 6 and finally ascends to 13 comma 20 with error bars extending between 12 point 6 and 13 point 4.\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/6f7d042c7a635868f7f4ea625535abaf/original.png\" width=\"374\"></p>\n"}]}]
