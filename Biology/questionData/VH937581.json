The model is as follows. Two pathways, the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway, converge to cause clot formation. The extrinsic pathway begins with damage to the tissue outside a vessel which initiates the release of thromboplastin from the tissue. The intrinsic pathway begins with damage to a blood vessel which triggers a cascade of clotting factors. The thromboplastin and the cascade of clotting factors both mediate the conversion of inactive Factor 10 to activated Factor 10. Activated Factor 10 then triggers the conversion of Prothrombin to Thrombin. Thrombin then triggers the conversion of Fibrinogen to Fibrin. Factor 13 interacts with Fibrin to produce a blood clot.\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH937581.g02.png\" width=\"535\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
