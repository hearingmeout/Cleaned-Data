In an experiment, the scientist creates two groups of twenty highly inbred mice. Because the mice are highly inbred, they are essentially identical to one another. One group is given food with an added substance that is known to be a mutagen. The second group is fed the same food without the mutagen. After several generations, both groups of mice are given a new type of food that is harder to digest than the previous food. After rearing five additional generations of the mice on this new food, the two groups are assessed for how efficiently this new food is digested.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the most reasonable prediction about the results of the experiment?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH975957_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neither group of mice will show any change in the ability to digest the food because thousands of years are required to develop such a change.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both groups of mice will show an increase in the ability to digest the new food, because they experienced the same selective pressures.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The group of mice fed the mutagen will show a greater ability to digest the food, because the higher genetic variation within the group makes it more likely that some individuals will have a combination of genes better adapted to the new food.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The group fed the mutagen will show a decrease in the ability to digest the new food, because the mutagen prevented natural selection from acting on them.</p>"],"answer":2}]
