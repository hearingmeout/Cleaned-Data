On two separate islands, the scientists recorded the number of finches with long tail feathers and the number of finches with short tail feathers. The results are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img alt=\"The table has 7 rows and 3 columns and shows the number of individuals of various phenotypes on two islands, Island 1 and Island 2.  The first row has the column headers as follows, from left to right: Location, Phenotype, and Number of Individuals.  The data in the remaining rows are as follows, from left to right and top to bottom: Row 2: Island 1, Long tail feathers, 1582. Row 3: Island 1, Short tail feathers, 598. Row 4: Island 1, Total count, 2180. Row 5: Island 2, Long tail feathers, 2432. Row 6: Island 2, Short tail feathers, 1110. Row 7: Island 2, Total count, 3542.
