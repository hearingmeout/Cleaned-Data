The cell in pond water is rectangular, and gray shading fills all of the cell except for space occupied by a central vacuole and the nucleus. The cell walls of the cell in the sugar solution are a bit collapsed, the central vacuole has shrunk to about half the size of the vacuole in the pond-water-cell, and gray shading only fills about half of the space unoccupied by the vacuole and nucleus. The cell walls of the cell in distilled water appear pushed out, the central vacuole is about four times the size of the vacuole in the pond-water-cell, and gray shading fills all the rest of the space in the cell except for that occupied by the nucleus.\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH913064.g01.png\" width=\"400\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
