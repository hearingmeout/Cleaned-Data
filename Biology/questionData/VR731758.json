The majority of hares also began the molting process during the same week in the spring, even though the ground was still snow covered. The researchers formulated a hypothesis that the timing of the molting process is influenced by seasonal changes in the daylight period.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Do the genes associated with coat color in both populations have the same sequence of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D N A\"><math alttext=\"D N A\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mtext>DNA</mtext></math></span></span> nucleotides?</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Are hares that have a white coat all year round better able to find food than those that change coat color?</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Is the reproductive fitness greater in hares that have a white coat all year round than in those that change coat colors?</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Is the same genetic code used to produce the enzymes involved in the production of coat color pigments in both populations?</p>"],"answer":0}]
