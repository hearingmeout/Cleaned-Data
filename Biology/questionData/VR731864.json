A key indicates that a rectangle with straight ends represents ethidium bromide and that four other rectangles that differ in shape at one end represent nitrogenous bases. Each D N A molecule is made of two strands and contains pairs of nitrogenous bases that extend horizontally inward from ribbons on the outside of each model. One of the DNA molecules is labeled Normal D N A and includes only nitrogenous bases. The other D N A molecule is labeled D N A in the Presence of Ethidium of Bromide and contains nitrogenous bases plus ethidium bromide scattered between the bases. The ethidium bromide molecules extend horizontally across the model and run parallel to the pairs of nitrogenous bases.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR731864.g03.svg\"/><p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
