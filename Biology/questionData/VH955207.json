One of the circles contains four individual chromosomes, two large and two small. The other circle contains two individual small chromosomes and one large chromosome that is still composed of a pair of chromatids and is labeled nondisjunction.\" height=\"236\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH955207.g02.png\" width=\"235\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
