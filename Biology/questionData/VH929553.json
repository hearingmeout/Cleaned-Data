The horizontal axis is labeled Time, in seconds, and the numbers 0 through 100, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled A T P Production, in kilocalories per kilogram per minute, and the numbers 0 through 45, in increments of 5, are indicated. The three curves are described as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The first curve, labeled Phosphagen, begins at the origin, and moves sharply upwards, reaching a peak at the point 2, comma 42.5. The curve then moves downwards and to the right at a decreasing rate, passing through the point 10, comma 25, the point 30, comma 8, and the point 60, comma 1, ending just above the horizontal axis at the point 100, comma 0. The second curve, labeled Glycolysis, begins at the origin, and moves steeply upwards and to the right, passing through the point 10, comma 23, and reaching a peak at the point 17, comma 25. The curve then moves downwards and to the right at a decreasing rate, passing through the point 50, comma 13, and ending at the point 100, comma 6. The third curve, labeled Mitochondrial respiration, begins at the origin, and moves gradually upwards and to the right at a decreasing rate, passing through the point 30, comma 8 and the point 50, comma 12, then ending at the point 100, comma 15.\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH929553.g03.png\" width=\"400\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1. <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> production by three metabolic pathways following the start of an intense period of exercise</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following correctly uses the data to justify the claim that the phosphagen system is an immediate, short-term source of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> for muscle cells?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH929553_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> production by the phosphagen system increases and decreases rapidly following the start of the exercise period.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> production by the phosphagen system increases gradually and continuously throughout the entire exercise period.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> produced by the phosphagen system contains more energy per molecule than does the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> produced by the other pathways.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A T P\"><math alttext=\"A T P\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>ATP</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> hydrolysis in muscle cells occurs immediately after the start of the exercise period but stops before the end of the exercise period.</p>"],"answer":0}]
