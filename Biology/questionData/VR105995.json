These algal blooms are generally followed by algal death and decomposition, which consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water and results in oxygen levels insufficient to support aerobic respiration. This process is known as eutrophication. The amount of algae present in a body of water can be estimated from the amount of chlorophyll <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">a</span> in a sample of the water. A researcher studying eutrophication collected samples at different times of the year in a freshwater ecosystem. The samples were analyzed for total nitrogen and chlorophyll <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">a</span> concentration (Figure 1) as well as total phosphorus and chlorophyll <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">a</span> concentration (Figure 2).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup align:center cols:2 frame:none\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colsep:0 colwidth:250 rowsep:0\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:center colsep:0 colwidth:250 rowsep:0\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\" class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 presents the graph of a line showing the amount of chlorophyll a in relation to the amount of total nitrogen.
