The dividing cells proceed through the three phases of the cell cycle as shown in the figure. When a person experiences a cut, damaged skin cells secrete a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF). Epidermal (skin) cells in the vicinity of the injury possess proteins in their cell membranes called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)</p>\n"}]}]
