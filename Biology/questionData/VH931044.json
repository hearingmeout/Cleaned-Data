The vertical axis is labeled Relative Activity, and no numbers are indicated along it, although the axis ends in an arrowhead. The line begins at the point p H 0 with 0 relative activity, and moves horizontally to the right to p H 1 and 0 relative activity. The line then slants upwards and to the right at a constant rate until p H 2, then slants sharply upwards and to the right at a fairly constant rate until its peak at p H 5. The line then slants sharply downwards and to the right at a constant rate until p H 6, where the relative activity is half that of the peak. The line continues to slant sharply downwards and to the right at a constant rate until p H 7, where the relative activity is one tenth that of the peak. The line then slants less sharply downwards, and to the right at a constant rate until p H 9, where the relative activity is almost 0.
