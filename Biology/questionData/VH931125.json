The student prepared slides of cells isolated from a growing onion root tip and viewed the slides under a dissecting microscope. The student then made diagrams of cells that were in different stages of mitosis and counted the number of cells that were in each of those stages.

Stage of Mitosis, 2 sets of chromosomes are starting to decondense and the cytoplasm is being divided between the 2 chromosome sets; Number of Cells, 4. Row 3.
