Ten mL of a concentrated starch solution and 1.0 mL of α-amylase solution were placed in a test tube. The test tube was inverted several times to mix the solution and then incubated at 25°C. The amount of product (maltose) present was measured every 10 minutes for an hour. The results are given in the table below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 2 columns and 8 rows. The top row contains the column labels: column one, Time open parenthesis minutes close parenthesis; column two, Maltose Concentration open parenthesis uM micro moles close parenthesis). From top to bottom, the data is as follows: Row two, Time in minutes, zero; Maltose Concentration (uM), zero.  Row three, Time in minutes, ten; Maltose Concentration (uM), five point one.  Row four, Time in minutes, twenty; Maltose Concentration (uM), eight point six.  Row five, Time in minutes, thirty; Maltose Concentration (uM), ten point four.  Row six, Time in minutes, forty; Maltose Concentration (uM), eleven point one.  Row seven, Time in minutes, fifty; Maltose Concentration (uM), eleven point two.  Row eight, Time in minutes, sixty; Maltose Concentration (uM), eleven point five.\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/ad731a8967cb53be2f512a3e63135b72/original.png\" width=\"355\" /></p>\n"}]}]
