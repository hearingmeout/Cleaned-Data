Each group of students assessed the species of plants in four environments and determined the Simpson's Diversity Index for each environment. The Simpson's Diversity Index takes into account the number of species present as well as the abundance of each species. The index values are shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph. The horizontal axis is labeled Type of Environment, and the 4 categories indicated are Light, Moist, then Light, Dry, then Dark, Moist, and finally Dark, Dry. The vertical axis is labeled Simpson’s Diversity Index, and the numbers 0 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. Each category along the horizontal axis corresponds with a bar. The data represented by the bars are as follows. Note that all data values are approximate. The Light, Moist bar extends from 0 to 0.9 and the error bar extends from 0.8 to 0.98. The Light, Dry bar extends from 0 to 0.5 and the error bar extends from 0.42 to 0.55.The Dark, Moist bar extends from 0 to 0.795 and the error bar extends from 0.7 to 0.89.The Dark, Dry bar extends from 0 to 0.35 and the error bar extends from 0.3 to 0.39.\" height=\"195\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR000786.g03.png\" width=\"400\">\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
