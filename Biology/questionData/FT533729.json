There is extracellular fluid on the far right, and then a plasma membrane to the right of the fluid, with the area to the right of the membrane labeled cytoplasm. There is a large oval figure that spans from one side of the plasma membrane to the other. A small figure attaches to the extracellular side of the figure in the membrane, and this is labeled step 1. Step 2 shows a small round figure emerging from the figure in the membrane, the round figure distorts its shape, then distorts its shape again to a long oval. To the right of the cytoplasm is the nucleus. The long oval shape enters the nucleus. Step 3 is a shape approaching a double stranded DNA helix in the nucleus. \" height=\"304\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/74c453405b76484a3409b989b2858dc1/original.png\" width=\"555\" /></p>\n\n<p>The figure above represents a generalized hormone-signaling pathway.
