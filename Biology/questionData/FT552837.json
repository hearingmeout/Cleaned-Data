The dye reduction technique was used. Each chloroplast suspension was mixed with DPIP, an electron acceptor that changes from blue to clear when it is reduced. Each sample was placed individually in a spectrophotometer and the percent transmittance was recorded. The three samples used were prepared as follows.</p><ul><li><p> Sample 1 – chloroplast suspension + DPIP</p></li><li><p> Sample 2 – chloroplast suspension surrounded by foil wrap to provide a dark environment + DPIP</p></li><li><p> Sample 3 – chloroplast suspension that has been boiled + DPIP</p></li></ul>"}]}]
