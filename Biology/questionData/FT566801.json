[{"id":"FT566801","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<p>Fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) with a wild-type phenotype have gray bodies and red eyes. Certain mutations can cause changes to these traits. Mutant flies may have a black body and/or cinnabar eyes. To study the genetics of these traits, a researcher crossed a true-breeding wild-type male fly (with gray body and red eyes) with a true-breeding female fly with a black body and cinnabar eyes. All of the F1 progeny displayed a wild-type phenotype.</p>\n\n<p>Female flies from the F1 generation were crossed with true-breeding male flies with black bodies and cinnabar eyes. The table below represents the predicted outcome and the data obtained from the cross. <strong>Explain</strong> the difference between the expected data and the actual numbers observed.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><img alt=\"A table titled \" height=\"180\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/90e95fb699b344f4eda0481708943dd7/original.jpg\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n"}]
