After being protected from hunting in the early 1900s, a remnant population of otters near Adak Island, Alaska, recovered rapidly. Otters did not return to the environmentally similar nearby island, Alaid Island. Sea otters eat sea urchins, which eat kelp, a brown alga. Researchers surveyed both islands in 1988, to measure sea urchin biomass and kelp density. The data are presented in Table 1.</p>\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Table 1.
