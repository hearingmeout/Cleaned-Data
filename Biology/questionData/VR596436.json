The feral hogs in each age-group of this population are counted once a year. Figure 1 shows the age pyramid of this population in one particular year. Feral hogs reproduce between <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"5\"><math alttext=\"5\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>5</mn></math></span></span> years of age.
