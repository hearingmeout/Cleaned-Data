The first part of the figure shows a cell that has 5 pairs of chromosomes lined up at the equator of the cell. Each chromosome is composed of 2 chromatids. An arrow points to the next part of the figure that shows the same cell with the chromosomes starting to separate. 4 chromosomes and an additional unseparated pair of chromosomes are shown on the left side of the cell. 4 chromosomes are shown on the right side of the cell. Arrows point from the cell to the next part of the figure that shows 2 cells. One of the 2 cells has 6 chromosomes, each composed of a pair of chromatids, all in a single line along the equator of the cell. The other cell has 4 chromosomes, each composed of a pair of chromatids, all in a single line along the equator of the cell. Arrows point from each cell to 2 more cells in the final part of the figure. The 2 cells derived from the cell with 6 chromosomes each have 6 chromosomes. The 2 cells derived from the cell with 4 chromosomes each have 4 chromosomes. These four cells are labeled Gametes.\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH971118.g02.png\" width=\"450\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
