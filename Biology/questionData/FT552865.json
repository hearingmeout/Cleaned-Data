The initial masses of six groups of potato cores were measured. The potato cores were placed in sucrose solutions of various molarities. The masses of the cores were measured again after 24 hours. Percent changes in mass were calculated. The results are shown below.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 2 columns and 7 rows. The top row contains the column labels: column one, Molarity of Sucrose in Beaker; column two, Percent Change in Mass. The data is as follows: Row two: Molarity of Sucrose in Beaker, zero point zero M; Percent Change in Mass, eighteen point zero. Row three: Molarity of Sucrose in Beaker, zero point two; Percent Change in Mass, five point zero. Row four: Molarity of Sucrose in Beaker, zero point four; Percent Change in Mass, negative eight point zero. Row five: Molarity of Sucrose in Beaker, zero point six; Percent Change in Mass, negative sixteen point zero.
