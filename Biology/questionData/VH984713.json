The categories are labeled along the horizontal axis as follows: Grasses, Sedges, Herbaceous Flowering Plants, and Subshrubs. Each category has two bars indicated on it, which are each labeled Lightly grazed and Heavily grazed, respectively. The vertical axis is labeled Number of Species, and the numbers 0 through 50, in increments of 5, are indicated. The data for each bar is presented as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Grasses. Lightly grazed, 20. Heavily grazed, 11. Sedges. Lightly grazed, 1. Heavily grazed, 1. Herbaceous Flowering Plants. Lightly grazed, 44. Heavily grazed, 34.  Subshrubs. Lightly grazed, 9.
