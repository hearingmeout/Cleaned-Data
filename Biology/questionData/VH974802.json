The researchers wish to increase the reliability of their experimental observations before investigating new claims that chemotherapy-resistant tumors are an example of continuing evolution.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Of the following, which is the best next step the researchers might take to increase the reliability of their evidence?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH974802_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increasing the dose of chemotherapy being administered to the mice</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increasing the number of trials and the number of mice in each treatment group</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Plotting the tumor volume data as a graph rather than as a table</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Isolating resistant tumor cells and looking for novel mutations in proto-oncogenes</p>"],"answer":1}]
