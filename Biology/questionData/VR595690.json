Decades of overharvesting have reduced the populations of both blue crabs and rockfish. However, recent efforts have increased the number of rockfish in the bay. Based on Figure&nbsp;1, what is the most likely result of the increase in rockfish?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR595690_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The population of menhaden will increase because the energy available from zooplankton will increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The population of menhaden will decrease because the energy resources available to them will decrease.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The population of zooplankton will decrease because the energy available from algae will decrease.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The population of blue crabs will decrease because predation by rockfish will increase.</p>"],"answer":3}]
