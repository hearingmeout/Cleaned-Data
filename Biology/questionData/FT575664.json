Starting in 1990, researchers sampled fish from the lake every four years and recorded the armor-plate phenotypes of the male sticklebacks in each sample. The armor-plate phenotypes were categorized as either complete (plates extending from head to tail), partial (plates extending from head to abdomen), or low (a few plates near the head only).
