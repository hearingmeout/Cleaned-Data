The scientists calculated the average beak depth of finches in mating pairs and then observed whether or not the pairs produced at least one offspring that survived to the next season. The data are represented in Figure 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 4 bars.
