The initial hypothesis was that an abrupt change in diet will benefit beef cattle by reducing the sizes of bacterial populations living in the digestive systems of the cattle.</p>\n\n<p>In the experiment, the researchers determined the relative abundance of two bacterial species found in the rumen of cattle. The rumen is a part of the stomach that acts as a fermentation chamber in cattle and other ruminants. Shown in the table are the results from before and after an abrupt change in the cattle’s diet. Based on the results, which of the following best explains why the initial hypothesis should be revised?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>The diets were too similar, since cellulose and starch are both carbohydrates obtained from eating plants.</p>","<p>The abundance of one of the bacterial species increased in response to the change in diet.</p>","<p>The change in the diversity of microorganisms had no observable effect on cattle physiology.</p>","<p>The ability of rumen fluid to resist changes in pH counteracted the changes in microorganism diversity.</p>"],"answer":0}]
