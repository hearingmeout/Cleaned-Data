Researchers compared the first 60 amino acids of the neuromodulin protein from each of five different species. The results are shown in the table above.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nBased on the data in the table, <strong>construct</strong> a cladogram on the template provided to represent the evolutionary relatedness of the five species.
