Five tick marks appear on the vertical axis and are labeled, from bottom to top, zero through 20, in increments of 5. On the graph, there are 8 data points connected by a curve drawn through the points. The first and last data points are the start and end of the curve, and the approximate coordinates of the data points are as follows: Point One: one comma 2. Point 2: two comma 2 point five.
