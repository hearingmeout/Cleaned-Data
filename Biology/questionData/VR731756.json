The majority of hares also began the molting process during the same week in the spring, even though the ground was still snow covered. The researchers formulated a hypothesis that the timing of the molting process is influenced by seasonal changes in the daylight period.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">More species that molt seasonally do so when the daylight period is the longest, than when the daylight period is the shortest.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">More species that molt seasonally do so when the daylight period is the shortest, than when the daylight period is the longest.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">More species that molt seasonally are found in the arctic, where the daylight period varies, than near the equator where the daylight period is relatively constant.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">More species that molt seasonally are found near the equator, where the daylight period is relatively constant, than in the arctic, where the daylight period varies.</p>"],"answer":2}]
