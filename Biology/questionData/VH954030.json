The signaling pathway is activated by the binding of epinephrine to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor.

A plasma membrane is shown with two transmembrane structures, a Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor and Adenylyl Cyclase. Epinephrine is shown binding to the extracellular surface of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Bound to the cytosolic surface of the receptor is a G protein made up of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. An arrow indicates that G D P that is bound to the alpha subunit of the G protein is now released from the subunit. A successive arrow points to the G protein subunits dissociated from the adrenergic receptor and the alpha subunit dissociated from a complex of the beta and gamma subunits. G T P is shown binding to the alpha subunit. A successive arrow points from the G T P-modified alpha subunit to the cytosolic region of adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase intersects an arrow that points from A T P to Cyclic A M P. A series of arrows follows. An arrow from Cyclic A M P points to Protein Kinase A. An arrow from Protein Kinase A points to Phosphorylase Kinase and is paired with a curved arrow pointing from A T P to A D P. An arrow from Phosphorylase Kinase points to Glycogen Phosphorylase and is paired with a curved arrow pointing from A T P to A D P. An arrow from Glycogen Phosphorylase points to an arrow indicating the conversion of Glycogen to Glucose-1-Phosphate. A final arrow points from Glucose-1-Phosphate to Glycolysis.\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH953991.g04.png\" width=\"420\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
