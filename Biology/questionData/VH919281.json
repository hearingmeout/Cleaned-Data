The following parts are labeled: nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, cytosol, and new protein in transport vesicle. The transport vesicle containing a new protein is shown in two positions: a start point and an end point. It starts out adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum, and an arrow is drawn upward from the transport vesicle toward an unlabeled component. The unlabeled component appears to be a series of stacked flat sacs. A second arrow is drawn upward from this unlabeled component toward the plasma membrane, where the transport vesicle with new protein is shown at its end point just inside the plasma membrane.\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH919281.g01.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Figure 1.
