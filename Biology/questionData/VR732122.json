An analysis of fossil marine invertebrates that existed during the Late Devonian has revealed that the rate of extinction was relatively constant, as compared with the rates of extinction before and after the Late Devonian. The fossil evidence also suggests that frequent increases in sea level during the Late Devonian effectively removed geographical barriers and allowed generalist species (species that can inhabit a wide range of habitats) to migrate into new areas.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe</span> how the geographical separation of two populations can lead to speciation.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR732122","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Explain</span> how a decrease in biodiversity during the Late Devonian could occur even though the extinction rate was relatively constant.</p></div>\n"},{"id":"VR732122","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:C part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"C\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Scientists claim that the modern rate of biodiversity loss may be even greater than that observed during the Late Devonian.
