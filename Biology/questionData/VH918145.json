Xylem cells are hollow cells stacked together like a straw. A student explains that evaporation of water from the leaf pulls water up from the roots through the xylem, as shown in Figure 1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a diagram of water flow through a plant. Arrows labeled Xylem Tissues Carry Water point from the roots into and up through the stem of the plant. Some of the arrows also point into a leaf. The leaf is shaded and labeled Water from the Soil. Arrows point out from the leaf into the air and are labeled Evaporation of Water from Leaves. A zoomed in portion of the stem shows the xylem in the stem, with dots representing water molecules and arrows pointing up through the xylem. A zoomed in portion of the leaf shows a cross section of the leaf with leaf cells on each side of a row of xylem-like cells that contain the dots that represent water. More dots are shown moving from the leaf into the air through an opening between the leaf cells.\" height=\"263\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH918145.g01.png\" width=\"455\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
