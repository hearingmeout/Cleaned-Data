Tadpole mouthparts can vary significantly, prompting researchers to categorize them as either omnivore-morph or carnivore-morph. Carnivore-morph tadpoles are larger and have mouthparts that are better suited for predation. Remarkably, carnivore-morph tadpoles can change into omnivore-morph tadpoles when the food supply changes.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best describes an advantage of the phenotypic plasticity displayed by the tadpoles?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH955563_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It allows the tadpoles to change their genome in response to environmental pressures.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It enables the tadpoles to develop into a distinct species of toads.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It gives the tadpoles increased versatility with respect to diet.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It allows the tadpoles to delay metamorphosis until there is maximal food available for the adults.</p>"],"answer":2}]
