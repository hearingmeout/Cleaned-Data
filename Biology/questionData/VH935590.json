The synthesis of chlorophyll pigments from precursor molecules is a process that involves many sequential enzyme-catalyzed steps. Researchers studied the growth and photosynthetic ability of a plant that contained a mutant form of one of the enzymes required for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Describe </span>the effect on chlorophyll-containing photosystems when the chlorophyll molecules absorb photons of light.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VH935590_rubric"},{"id":"VH935590","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Identify </span>an appropriate control that the researchers should use when they study the growth and photosynthetic ability of the plant with the mutant enzyme.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VH935590_rubric"},{"id":"VH935590","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:C part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"C\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Scientists claim that a plant that has more than one type of photosynthetic pigment has greater fitness than a plant that has only one type of photosynthetic pigment. <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Provide reasoning</span> to justify this claim.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VH935590_rubric"}]
