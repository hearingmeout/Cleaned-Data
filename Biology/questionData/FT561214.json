At the beginning of the experiment, the plants in group I were dried and the mass was determined. The plants in group II were maintained in light for a week. The plants in group III were maintained in the dark for a week. All conditions, other than light, were the same for groups II and III. At the end of the week, the plants in groups II and III were dried and the mass was determined. The experimental results are provided in the table.</p>\n"}]}]
