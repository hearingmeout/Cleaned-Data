To investigate the ability of various enzymes to digest gelatin, a group of students set up an assay involving camera film. Camera film contains gelatin and appears black when exposed to light but turns clear as the gelatin gets broken down. The students incubated pieces of exposed camera film in test tubes, each containing one of three different enzyme solutions (trypsin, lipase, or amylase) as indicated in Figure&nbsp;1. The students recorded the time it took for the enzymes to digest the gelatin in each test tube, turning the film from black to clear.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a beaker partially filled with a liquid.
