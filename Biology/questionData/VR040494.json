Between 1750 and 1850, hunting had reduced the population from hundreds of thousands to only one thousand individuals. In the early 1900s, a small population of sea otters was discovered in Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in central California near a large human population center. The otters were then protected by the international fur seal treaty, which banned sea otter hunting. The sea otter population has rebounded to nearly three thousand individuals today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Otters live in kelp forests and eelgrass beds and feed on crabs and shellfish (Figure&nbsp;1). Most herbivores in the habitat eat algae that grows on the eelgrass and not the eelgrass itself. If there is too much algae, the eelgrass does not receive enough light for photosynthesis. As the otter population has increased, the eelgrass habitat has increased.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a vertically oriented food chain with 5 organisms depicted and arrows indicating the direction of flow.

Scientists have also observed that otters in the area are experiencing increased mortality because of an increase in harmful algal blooms, which occur as a result of nutrient pollution. The harmful algae are ingested by shellfish, which the otters eat.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Ocean warming will favor population growth of nonnative species as their habitats shift northward.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Ocean warming will decrease eelgrass habitat area as a result of increased herbivory by nonnative species.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Harmful algal blooms will decrease otter populations as a result of increased mortality of otter prey species.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Harmful algal blooms will decrease the availability of nutrients for eelgrass and other algae species.</p>"],"answer":0}]
