An increase in blood glucose levels stimulates beta cells to produce insulin, which facilitates the uptake of glucose by body cells and reduces the glucose levels in the blood. As the blood glucose levels decrease, beta cells are no longer stimulated and stop producing insulin.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following best explains the feedback mechanism that regulates blood glucose levels?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR595671_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Regulation of blood glucose levels demonstrates positive feedback, because as the blood glucose levels increase, insulin acts to raise blood glucose levels.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Regulation of blood glucose levels demonstrates negative feedback, because as the blood glucose levels increase, insulin acts to lower blood glucose levels.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Regulation of blood glucose levels demonstrates positive feedback, because as the production of insulin by beta cells increases, blood glucose levels increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Regulation of blood glucose levels demonstrates negative feedback, because as the production of insulin by beta cells decreases, blood glucose levels decrease.</p>"],"answer":1}]
