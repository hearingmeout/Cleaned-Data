Nothing is added to the other beaker. After two more hours at room temperature, the mass of each bag is determined. There is no change in the mass of the dialysis bag in the beaker to which no albumin was added.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the graphs below best represents the predicted change in mass over time of the dialysis bag in the beaker to which albumin was added?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH907845_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph in the coordinate plane.
