The plant is considered an invasive species in regions outside of its native range. In a particular region, the seeds of <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">A. trifida</span> germinate from early March through the end of the summer, while the seeds of other annual plants require warmer soil temperatures and thus germinate from late April through the end of the summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers studied the influence of <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">A. trifida</span> on the biodiversity of other annual plant species that grow in the same field. In early spring, the researchers marked off identical plots of land in a field that had been plowed the previous fall and not replanted with new crops. All plants that grew on one half of the plots were left untouched (Figure 1A), while all germinating <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">A. trifida</span> seedlings were removed from the other half of the plots throughout the spring and summer (Figure 1B). In late summer, the researchers counted and identified all plants that grew in the plots. The distribution of plants is represented by the symbols in Figures 1A and 1B.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a diagram of two rectangular plots with symbols in the rectangles to represent plants.
