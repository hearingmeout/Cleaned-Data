The paper is a narrow strip with a pointed tip at the bottom. 0 centimeters corresponds to the bottom of the chromatography paper, above the pointed tip, at a line labeled pigment extract, also called origin.  At 1 centimeter a thick line across the chromatography paper is labeled chlorophyll b, or greenish yellow, and directly above that is a thick line labeled chlorophyll a, or blue green. At 3.5 centimeters another thick line across the paper is xanthophyll, or yellow, and above that at 7 centimeters is carotene, or yellow orange.
