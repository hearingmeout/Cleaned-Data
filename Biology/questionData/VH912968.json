The two amino acids are identical except for their R groups. The central atom in each amino acid is a carbon atom. The left side of each amino acid is an N H 2 group in which a nitrogen atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and the right side of each amino acid is a C O O H group in which a carbon atom is double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to the oxygen atom of an O H group. The R group of the first amino acid is labelled R prime, and the R group of the second amino acid is labelled R double prime. The two amino acids are joined by a peptide bond, and a molecule of water is produced. The peptide bond consists of a bond between a carbon and a nitrogen atom. The carbon atom in the peptide bond is also bonded to the carbon atom that bears the R prime group and double bonded to an oxygen atom. The nitrogen atom in the peptide bond is also bonded to the carbon atom that bears the R double prime group and to a hydrogen atom.\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH912968.g01.png\" width=\"275\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
