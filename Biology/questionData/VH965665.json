A primary tool for mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However, mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a schematic line drawing of the transmembrane sodium channel protein in the plasma membrane. The protein consists of four domains, numbered one through four, of almost identical structure. Each domain is formed by six transmembrane segments, and the segments are connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. The beginning of the protein, labeled H 3 N, and the end of the protein, labeled C O O with a negative one charge, are both on the same side of the membrane. An arrow labeled 1014 points to the middle of the sixth transmembrane segment of domain two.\" height=\"141\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH965665.g04.png\" width=\"500\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
