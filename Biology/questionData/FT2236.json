[{"id":"FT2236","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p>A series of crosses is performed with fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) to examine inheritance of the genes <em>vestigial</em> (<em>vg</em>) and <em>cinnabar</em> (<em>cn</em>). The recessive <em>vg</em> allele causes small, malformed wings called vestigial wings. The recessive <em>cn</em> allele causes bright-red eyes called cinnabar eyes.</p>\n\n<p>In the first cross, a female with wild-type wings and eyes is mated with a male with vestigial wings and cinnabar eyes.
