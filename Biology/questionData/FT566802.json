The horizontal axis is labeled days from zero to eleven with tick marks in increments of one and the vertical axis labeled number of individuals per liter from zero to three hundred with tick marks in increments of ten. There are ten data points shown on the graph with error bars for each data point., The growth curve is approximately half of a bell curve. There are two periods on the graph, period one spans from day two to day six, and period two spans from day seven to day nine. Day zero the population is twenty individuals per liter. Day one the population is thirty with an error of ten. Day two the population is seventy with an error of ten. Day three the population is one hundred and thirty, with an error of sixty. Day four the population is one hundred and fifty-five with an error of twenty. Day five the population is two hundred and twenty with an error of twenty. Day six the population is two hundred and sixty with an error of five. Day seven the population is two hundred and sixty-five with an error of fifteen. Day eight the population is two hundred and seventy with an error of ten. Day nine the population is two hundred and seventy five with an error of five.\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/f18d04fc2e3bc9d4823e62950ba6994b/original.png\" width=\"550\" /></p>\n\n<p>In one paragraph, <strong>explain </strong>the biological factors that determine the shape of the growth pattern shown above in both period 1 and period 2.</p>\n"}]
