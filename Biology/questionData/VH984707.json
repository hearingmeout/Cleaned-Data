The horizontal axis is labeled Treatment, and the numbers 1 through 4 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Plant Biomass, in milligrams, and the numbers 0 through 900, in increments of 100, are indicated. A shaded bar corresponds with each treatment along the horizontal axis. The data represented in the bar graph are as follows. Note that all data values are approximate. Treatment 1 is shown to be negative for A M fungi and negative for soil bacteria. The bar for treatment 1 extends from 0 through 290 and the error bar extends from 190 through 390. Treatment 2 is shown to be negative for A M fungi and positive for soil bacteria. The bar for treatment 2 extends from 0 through 20 and the error bar extends from 0 through 40. Treatment 3 is shown to be positive for A M fungi and negative for soil bacteria. The bar for treatment 3 extends from 0 through 630 and the error bar extends from 510 through 780. Treatment 4 is shown to be positive for A M fungi and positive for soil bacteria.
