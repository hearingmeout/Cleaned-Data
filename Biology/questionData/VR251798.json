Stomata help prevent water loss and control gas exchange with the environment to maintain plant homeostasis. The turgor pressure of the guard cells on either side of the stomata determines whether the stomata are open or closed based on the transport of certain ions into and out of the guard cells (Figure 1). A proton pump in the membrane of the guard cells pumps protons into the extracellular space. This makes the interior of the cell more negatively charged than the extracellular space.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 includes a diagram showing models of an Open Stoma and of a Closed Stoma. In each, the vertically positioned central stoma is enclosed on the left and the right sides by a pair of guard cells. The area outside of the guard cells is labeled Extracellular Space. Proteins in the guard cell membranes are indicated. Each model is described as follows. In the Open Stoma model, the stoma is represented as a relatively wide symmetrical concave space, and the guard cells are crescent-shaped. An arrow points from the one H with a plus one charge ion in a guard cell through a membrane channel to three H with a plus one charge ions in the extracellular space. An arrow that is labeled at the beginning with A T P and at the end with A D P plus P i touches the channel. Another arrow points from the one K with a plus one charge ion in the extracellular space through a membrane channel to six K with a plus one charge ions in a guard cell. A final arrow indicates that H 2 O molecules are entering the guard cells by passing through a membrane channel from the extracellular space.  In the Closed Stoma model, the stoma appears as a narrow slit, and the guard cells are flatter in shape than in the Open Stoma model. Three H with a plus one charge ions are inside a guard cell and two are in the extracellular space, and there is no movement of the H with a plus one charge ions across the guard cell membrane. An arrow points from three K with a plus one charge ions inside a guard cell through a membrane channel to three K with a plus one charge ions in the extracellular space. Another arrow indicates that H 2 O molecules are leaving the guard cell through a membrane channel to enter the extracellular space.\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR251798.g01.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"standalone_statement style:1\">Figure 1.

Analysis of the mutant plant showed a mutation in the gene encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase (<span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"C D K\"><math alttext=\"C D K\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>CDK</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>).

In wild-type plants, C D K W T interacts with cyclin, as represented by overlapping labels in the figure. This interaction is shown to the left of an arrow that points from R N A polymerase to R N A polymerase with a phosphate group attached. On the right side of the arrow between R N A polymerase and phosphorylated R N A polymerase is an additional arrow that points from A T P to A D P. A final arrow points from phosphorylated R N A polymerase to a label that says: Normal cell Division, Normal Density of Stomata. In mutant plants, the figure labels for C D K M U T and cyclin do not overlap. The separate labels are shown to the left of an arrow that points from R N A polymerase to an identical unmodified R N A polymerase. The label ATP is shown to the right of the arrow and is unconnected to it. A final arrow points from the second R N A polymerase to a label that says: Increased Epidermal Cell Division, Decreased Density of Stomata.\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR251798.g02.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Figure 2.
