To feed, the moth inserts its proboscis (a long, tubular mouthpart) into the flower to reach the nectary, which is usually at the end of a long tube in the flower. Moths will feed on the nectar of the tobacco plant species whose nectaries they can access. A study determined the proboscis sizes in one tobacco hawk moth population. The data are shown in Figure 1. The most abundant tobacco species in the population’s habitat has a nectary tube that is <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"5 centimeters\"><math alttext=\"5 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.25em\"></mspace><mtext>cm</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> long.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with the Proboscis length distribution in a population of tobacco hawk moths.
