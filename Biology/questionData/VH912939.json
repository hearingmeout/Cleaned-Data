Bonds between alternating sugars and phosphate groups connect three nucleotides on each strand. The end of each strand at the bottom of the figure is labeled, with one strand labeled 3 prime end and the other strand labeled 5 prime end. The order of nitrogenous bases on one strand is guanine, adenine, and cytosine. The corresponding order of nitrogenous bases on the other strand is cytosine, thymine, and guanine. Bonds shown between the nitrogenous bases of the two strands hold the two strands together. Specifically, the guanine is bonded to the cytosine by three bonds, the adenine is bonded to the thymine by two bonds, and the cytosine is bonded to the guanine by three bonds.\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH912939.g03.png\" width=\"480\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"standalone_statement style:1\">Figure 1.
