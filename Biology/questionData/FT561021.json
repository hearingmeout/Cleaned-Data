The data from the study are shown in the table, along with the overall change in the frequency of bacterial resistance in patient samples from 1994 to 2000.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table titled INCIDENCE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN PATIENTS ADMITTED TO ICUs FROM 1994 TO 2000 with 3 columns and 5 rows is shown.
