An arrow points from the plant to a molecule composed of three hexagonal rings joined sequentially by O atoms. Each hexagon has an O atom at the top right point. The five other points of each hexagon have C atoms. O H groups are bonded with each of the two C atoms at the bottom of the hexagon, and a C H 2 O H group is bonded with the fifth C atom that is at the top of the ring immediately to the left of the ring’s O atom. Another arrow points from this molecule to a rabbit. A final arrow points from the rabbit to another molecule. The molecule has a backbone of 16 sequential C atoms. The first C atom is also bonded with an O H group and double bonded with an O atom. The next 14 C atoms are also bonded with two H atoms.
