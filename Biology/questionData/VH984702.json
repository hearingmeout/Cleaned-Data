They collected samples from 58 sites along 11 streams in the same geographical area. Their data were classified by stream type and can be found in Figure&nbsp;1. The stream-type classifications range from the perennial stream type, which always has water, to the intermittent stream type, which is dry for more than nine months during the year.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 4 bars.
