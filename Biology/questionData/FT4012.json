Another pair of alleles determines hair length (short and long). Thus, each gamete will contain one of the coat-color alleles, <em>C</em> or <em>c</em> and one of the hair-length alleles, <em>B</em> or <em>b</em>. In repeated crosses of a specific dark, short-haired dog with an albino, long-haired dog, all the offspring were dark with short hair, as shown in cross I. However, in subsequent crosses of another dark, short-haired dog with a dark, long-haired dog, the ratios shown in cross II below were obtained.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with 3 columns and 3 rows.
