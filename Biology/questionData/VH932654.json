The horizontal axis is labeled Time, and no numbers are indicated along it. The vertical axis is labeled Amount of Product, and no numbers are indicated along it. Both axes end with arrowheads. The curve begins at the intersection of the 2 axes, then moves upwards and to the right at about a 45 degree angle. The curve then levels off, becoming approximately horizontal as it moves to the right.
