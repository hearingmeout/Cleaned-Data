An arrow indicates that glucose enters a cell by crossing the cell membrane through a Glucose Transporter. A series of straight arrows indicate the steps in the pathway, starting with Glucose and ending with the Krebs Cycle. Curved arrows adjacent to some of the straight arrows indicate other reactions that occur simultaneously with the reactions indicated by the straight arrows. Starting with Glucose, an arrow points to Glucose-6-phosphate, and an adjacent curved arrow points from A T P to A D P.  An arrow points from Glucose-6-phosphate to Fructose-6-phosphate. An arrow points from Fructose-6-phosphate to Fructose-1,6-diphosphate, and an adjacent curved arrow points from A T P to A D P. Another arrow labeled Phosphofructokinase points to the arrow between Fructose-6-phosphate and Fructose-1,6-diphosphate. An arrow points from Fructose-1,6-diphosphate to Two Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. An arrow points from Two Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to Two 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate, and an adjacent curved arrow points from 2 N A D with a positive 1 charge to 2 N A D H. An arrow points from Two 1,3-Diphosphoglycerate to Two 3-Phosphoglycerate, and an adjacent curved arrow points from 2 A D P to 2 A T P. An arrow points from Two 3-Phosphoglycerate to Two 2-Phosphoglycerate. An arrow points from Two 2-Phosphoglycerate to Two Phosphoenolpyruvate, and a dashed arrow labeled “Na F Inhibits” points to this arrow between Two 2-Phosphoglycerate and Two Phosphoenolpyruvate. An arrow points from Two Phosphoenolpyruvate to Pyruvate, and an adjacent curved arrow points from 2 A D P to 2 A T P. An arrow labeled “Amino Acids Enter Here” points to the arrow between Two Phosphoenolpyruvate and Pyruvate. An arrow points from Pyruvate to Acetyl Co A, and an arrow labeled “Amino Acids and Fatty Acids Enter Here” points to the arrow between Pyruvate and Acetyl Co A.
