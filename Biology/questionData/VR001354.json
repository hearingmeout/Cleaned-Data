In Costa Rica, two different species of mites, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Rhinoseius colwelli</span> and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Rhinoseius richardsoni</span>, exhibit a high degree of interspecies competition. Both mite species live within the flowers of plants, and adult male mites tend to kill mites if they belong to a different species. An experiment was carried out to determine whether these aggressive interactions have resulted in niche partitioning by <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">R. colwelli</span> and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">R. richardsoni</span>, of different flower species, with each mite species living in different plant species. The results are summarized in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a bar graph with 4 categories. The categories are labeled along the horizontal axis as Species 1 through Species 4. Each category has two bars indicated on it, which are each labeled R. colwelli and R. richardsoni respectively.
