One group of researchers hypothesizes that without functional aquaporins, no water will be able to enter the cell. A different group proposes an alternative hypothesis, stating that even with nonfunctional aquaporins, a small amount of water will still cross the cell membrane. An experiment is set up in which plant cells with mutated (nonfunctional) aquaporins and plant cells with normally functioning aquaporins are both placed in distilled water.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following data would support the alternative hypothesis?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH968142_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cells with functional aquaporins exhibit low turgor pressure and are hypertonic.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cells with functional aquaporins exhibit high turgor pressure and are hypotonic.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cells with mutated aquaporins exhibit an absence of turgor pressure and are completely plasmolyzed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cells with mutated aquaporins exhibit moderate turgor pressure and are hypertonic.</p>"],"answer":3}]
