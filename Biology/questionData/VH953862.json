Between telophase and cytokinesis, the cell divides in two, with each cell receiving half of the replicated chromosomes.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">New chromosomes formed during prophase are doubled during anaphase and are recombined before cytokinesis.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Chromosomes enter metaphase containing two chromatids attached by a centromere. During anaphase, the chromatids are separated, each becoming a chromosome. Cytokinesis distributes the chromosomes into two separate cells.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At anaphase a cell contains two identical copies of each chromosome, but following telophase, one of the copies is broken down into nucleotides.</p>"],"answer":2}]
