The curve is a bell curve with a peak at pH 7.  Graph II has an x-axis labeled pH showing pH six to ten in increments of 2, and a y-axis labeled relative activity. The curve increases exponentially then levels out at pH 7.  Graph III has an x-axis labeled pH showing pH two to six in increments of 2, and a y-axis labeled relative activity. The curve is the second half of a bell curve, starting just before the peak, with a peak at pH 2.  Graph IV has an x-axis labeled pH showing pH four to eight in increments of 2, and a y-axis labeled relative activity. The curve is a slope of zero high on the y-axis, from pH 4 to after pH 8. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/8e00770d868c63f7a80b8da403f5709b/original.png\"/></p>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>I only</p>","<p>IV only</p>","<p>II and III only</p>","<p>III and IV only</p>","I, II, and III only"],"answer":3}]
