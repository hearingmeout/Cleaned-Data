Each part of the figure shows the polypeptide backbone horizontally across the figure, in which an N atom is bonded to a C atom, which is bonded to another C atom, a pattern that is repeated four more times from left to right. Every second C atom of the backbone is also connected to an O atom by a double bond, and the N atom that is next along the backbone is also connected to an H atom by a single bond. Each of the C atoms that precedes the one bonded to the O atom is bonded to an H atom and to an R group that is characteristic of the particular amino acid. The five R groups in the first part of the figure, from left to right, are as follows: In the first R group, a C atom is bonded to an H atom, to an O H group, and to a C H 3 group. In the second R group, a C atom is bonded to two H atoms and to a chain of three sequential C atoms, each also bonded to two H atoms. The last C atom of the chain is also bonded to an N H 3 group, and the N atom has a positive charge. In the third R group, a C atom is bonded to two H atoms and to a second C atom that is bonded to two H atoms and to a C atom that has a double bond with an O atom and a single bond with an O atom with a negative charge. In the fourth R group, a C atom is bonded to an H atom and to two C H 3 groups. The fifth R group is a single H atom. The five R groups in the second part of the figure, from left to right, are as follows: In the first R group, a C atom is bonded to an H atom, to an O H group, and to a C H 3 group. In the second R group, a C atom is bonded to an H atom, to a C H 3 group, and to a C atom that is bonded to two H atoms and to a C H 3 group. In the third R group, a C atom is bonded to a C H 3 group. In the fourth R group, a C atom is bonded to an H atom and to two C H 3 groups.
