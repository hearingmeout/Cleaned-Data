One of the signaling pathways involves the glucocorticoid receptor, an intracellular protein that is activated by binding to a glucocorticoid molecule.

A plasma membrane separates the extracellular space outside the plasma membrane from the cytosol inside the plasma membrane. A glucocorticoid is represented in the extracellular space. An arrow indicates that the glucocorticoid crosses the plasma membrane to the cytosol. In the cytosol the following three stages are represented in order from left to right. First, accessory proteins are associated with an inactive glucocorticoid receptor, then the glucocorticoid approaches the inactive glucocorticoid receptor and the accessory proteins dissociate from the inactive receptor, then the glucocorticoid is bound to the activated glucocorticoid receptor, and this complex moves into the nucleus, where a label indicates that changes in gene expression take place.\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH961329.g02.png\" width=\"400\" />\n<p class=\"caption\">Figure 1.
