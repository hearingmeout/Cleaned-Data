The majority of hares also began the molting process during the same week in the spring, even though the ground was still snow covered. The researchers formulated a hypothesis that the timing of the molting process is influenced by seasonal changes in the daylight period.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The biomass of producers will decrease.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The biomass of the lynx will increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">New predators will feed on the owls.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The lynx and owl populations will decrease.</p>"],"answer":3}]
