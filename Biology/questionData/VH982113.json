The trill call consists of a series of medium-pitched notes given rapidly, while the whistle call consists of a single high-pitched note. The objective of the experiment is to determine the function of each vocalization. Recordings of the calls were played to four different groups of squirrels, and the response of each individual squirrel was documented. The responses are summarized in Table&nbsp;1.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Table 1. Response of ground squirrels to recorded vocalizations</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure presents a 9 column table, titled Response of ground squirrels to recorded vocalizations. Column 1 contains row headers for Groups A through D. The data presented in columns 2 through 9 represent the percentage of Squirrels responding. In columns 2 through 5, the data presents responses for the Trill Alarm Call. In columns 6 through 9, the data presents responses for the Whistle Alarm Call. For each type of Alarm Call, the following four response types are given: Crouching; Posting (standing on hind legs); Run to shelter; and Other or no response. There are 4 rows of data which are presented as follows. Row 1, Group A. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 12 percent. Posting, 65 percent. Run to shelter, 22 percent. Other, 1 percent. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 42 percent. Posting, 2 percent. Run to shelter, 51 percent. Other, 5 percent. Row 2, Group B. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 9 percent. Posting, 58 percent. Run to shelter, 31 percent. Other, 2 percent. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 38 percent. Posting, 0 percent. Run to shelter, 60 percent. Other, 2 percent. Row 3, Group C. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 15 percent. Posting, 64 percent. Run to shelter, 18 percent. Other, 3 percent. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 48 percent. Posting, 4 percent. Run to shelter, 44 percent. Other, 4 percent. Row 4, Group D. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 11 percent. Posting, 66 percent. Run to shelter, 21 percent. Other, 2 percent. Trill Alarm Call. Crouching, 1 percent. Posting, 1 percent. Run to shelter, 57 percent.
