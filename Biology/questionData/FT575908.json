Fructose six phosphate has a ring structure with an oxygen atom at the top of the ring and carbon atoms at the four other vertices of the ring. A hydroxyl group is attached to carbon 1 above the ring and a phosphate group is attached to carbon 6 above the ring. Fructose one six bisphosphate is identical in structure to fructose six phosphate except that it has two phosphate groups because a phosphate group replaces the hydroxyl group attached to carbon 1. An arrow that points from fructose six phosphate to fructose one six bisphosphate has a curved arrow touching it that points from A T P to A D P and is labeled P F K.\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/8732835bbf46818b839c90ce0698d3e1/original.jpg\" width=\"350\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">Figure 1.
