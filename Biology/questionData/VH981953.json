However, there were some individuals in the population with white fur (albino). Genetic analysis revealed that the albino condition is expressed by individuals who are homozygous recessive <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"lowercase g lowercase g\"><math alttext=\"lowercase g lowercase g\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>g</mi><mi>g</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
