The figure includes several cellular organelles, and arrows between the organelles indicate the path insulin takes in the cell. A representation of a nucleus is at the top of the figure, and an organelle with many folds and dots on its outer surface is immediately below the nucleus. An arrow points from a collection of tiny dots in an interior portion of this organelle to a single circular structure with tiny dots inside. The next arrow points from this circular structure to an organelle composed on several layers of flat sacs. The next arrow points from a collection of tiny dots in one of the flat sacs to another single circular structure with tiny dots inside. The final arrow points from the circular structure to the plasma membrane.
