[{"id":"FT559165","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"Normal tooth brushing effectively removes much of the plaque from the flat surfaces of teeth but cannot reach the surfaces between teeth. Many commercial toothpastes contain alkaline components, which raise the pH of the mouth. <strong>Predict</strong> how the population sizes of <em>S. mutans</em> AND <em>S. sanguinis</em> in the bacterial community in the plaque between the teeth are likely to change when these toothpastes are used.","features":[{"type":"sharedpassage","html":"<p>Many species of bacteria grow in the mouths of animals and can form biofilms on teeth (plaque). Within plaque, the outer layers contain high levels of oxygen and the layers closest to the tooth contain low levels of oxygen. The surface of the tooth is covered in a hard layer of enamel, which can be dissolved under acidic conditions. When the enamel breaks down, the bacteria in plaque can extract nutrients from the tooth and cause cavities. </p><p></p><p>Certain types of bacteria (e.g.,<em> Streptococcus mutans</em>) thrive in the innermost anaerobic layers of the plaque and are associated with cavities. Other types of bacteria (<em>Streptococcus sanguinis</em>) compete with <em>S. mutans</em> but are unable to thrive in acidic environments. </p>"}]}]
