In one part of the figure, arrows indicate a transport vesicle moving from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and further arrows indicate lysosomes that have pinched off from the Golgi apparatus. In another part of the figure, a food particle is shown in an invagination of the plasma membrane, a process that is labeled phagocytosis. An arrow indicates that the food particle is now moving through the cytosol in a food vacuole.
