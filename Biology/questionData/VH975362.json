The diagram begins with a large circle labeled Original Species, which is to the left of a rectangle labeled Geographic Barrier. From the Original Species, two arrows point to the right, one points above and the other points below the Geographic Barrier. The arrow pointing above the barrier points to medium sized Circle A. An arrow points to the right from Circle A to Square A, both appear to have the same height. The arrow pointing below the barrier points to medium sized Circle B.
