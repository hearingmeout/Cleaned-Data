One strategy is to introduce guppies, a type of freshwater fish, into areas where mosquitoes are a problem. Guppies can consume large numbers of mosquito larvae, which cuts down on the number of mosquitoes living to adulthood.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Researchers assessing the effectiveness of the guppy solution are concerned that the introduction of guppies might cause more problems than it is fixing.
