The mass begins at twenty percent on the vertical axis and zero on the horizontal axis and decreases steadily to a negative twenty-five percent change in mass at a molarity of zero point eight. At molarity of zero point two the percent change is five, at  zero point four molarity the percent change is negative eight, at zero point six molarity the percent change is negative sixteen, and then it remains constant at negative twenty-five from  zero point eight to one molarity.\" height=\"227\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/1cfb42d0-a5bc-436c-8989-4ec0aa37ca11.png\" width=\"325\" /></p>\n\n<p>Water enters and leaves the plant cells primarily by</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>endocytosis</p>","<p>phagocytosis</p>","<p>osmosis</p>","<p>active transport</p>","<p>facilitated diffusion</p>"],"answer":1}]
