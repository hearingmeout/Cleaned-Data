The x-axis is labeled time in minutes from zero to eight in increments of 1. There are four curves representing the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism. The first curve is a mouse at twelve degrees Celsius, the curve increases steadily until two minutes then the rate increases, reaching 100 just after three minutes. The second curve is a mouse at twenty degrees Celsius. The curve has an increasing rate, reaching 100 between five and six minutes. The third curve is rat at twelve degrees Celsius. The rate is increasing, reaching 100 between seven and eight minutes. The fourth curve is a rat at twenty degrees Celsius. The curve increases steadily until two minutes, then there is an increase in the rate, reaching 50 between seven and eight minutes. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/65c15b2fa03637bdfae8aef0c23ce3d3/original.png\"/></p><p></p><p></p>"}],"choicesHtml":["Metabolic rate per gram of tissue is higher&nbsp;in smaller mammals.","<p>Metabolic rate per gram of tissue is not related to body mass. </p>","<p>Mice produce less CO<sub>2 </sub>per gram of tissue than do rats. </p>","<p>Rats consume more food per gram of tissue than do mice.</p>","<p>Rats lose more heat per gram of tissue than do mice.</p>"],"answer":-1}]
