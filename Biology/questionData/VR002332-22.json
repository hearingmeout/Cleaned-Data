The game reserve encompasses a variety of habitats, from open grassland to wooded areas around rivers and streams. It contains most of the indigenous mammal species and an adequate availability of their prey. For the most part, the leopards and lions show similar habitat preferences in the reserve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The mass of the average lion is about three times that of the average leopard. The scientists analyzed several factors that might influence the abundance of each population, including the sizes of the animals preyed on by each species (Table 1).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Table 1.

The line moves up to 97 about two thirds of the way through year 2 and then gradually drops to 72 about half way through year 3, where it then moves up to 81 at the end of year 3. The line moves horizontally and then up to 87 about one third of the way through year 4, then horizontally and then up to 92 half way through year 4. Then the line dips briefly to 89 and moves back up to 101 at the end of year 4. The line then moves gradually down and to the right to 68 about two thirds of the way through year 5, then back up to 84 at the end of year 5. The line drops sharply to 75 one fourth of the way through year 6, then moves horizontally until half way through year 6, when it drops sharply to 65 three fourths of the way through year 6 before moving back up to 71 at the end of year 6.
