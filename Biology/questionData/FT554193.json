Circadian rhythms are controlled by both genetics and environmental conditions, including light.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers investigated the effect of light on mouse behavior by using a running wheel with a motion sensor to record activity on actograms, as shown in Figure 1.<br>\n<img alt=\"Figure 1: An actogram with x-axis labeled time in hours from zero to twenty-four, and y-axis labeled days from one to seven.

Strategy for recording mouse activity data. When a mouse is active on the running wheel, the activity is recorded as a dark horizontal line on an actogram. When the mouse is inactive, no dark line is recorded.</p>\n\n<p>For the investigation, adult male mice were individually housed in cages in a soundproof room at 25°C. Each mouse was provided with adequate food, water, bedding material, and a running wheel. The mice were exposed to daily periods of 12 hours of light (L) and 12 hours of dark (D) (L12:D12) for 14 days, and their activity was continuously monitored. The activity data are shown in Figure 2.<br>\n<img alt=\"Figure 2: An actogram with x-axis labeled Time in hours from zero to twenty-four, and y-axis labeled Days from one to fourteen. Hours zero to twelve are labeled Light, and hours twelve to twenty-four are labeled Dark. There are four days that have a very short dark line during the light period between zero and twelve hours that represents approximately one half hour or less of activity. On all other days there are no dark lines during the light period. In the dark period each day has a dark horizontal line from twelve to twenty four hours, except for eight days that have one or two gaps in the horizontal line representing a break in activity for approximately one hour around hour twenty-two.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/cbb2bb5d6b4607a5895510b402212ce4/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Figure 2.

Each row represents a 24-hour period, and the dark horizontal lines represent activity on the running wheel.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n<br>\nAfter 14 days in L12:D12, the mice were placed in continuous darkness (DD), and their activity on the running wheel was recorded as before. The activity data under DD conditions are shown in Figure 3.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Figure 3: An actogram with x-axis labeled time in hours from zero to twenty-four, and y-axis labeled days from one to forty. The activity follows a pattern of approximately eleven hours of activity followed by eleven hours of inactivity, which is depicted as a dark horizontal line for eleven hours followed by no line for eleven hours into the following day.  The horizontal line followed by no line shifts each day by approximately two hours. On day one activity begins at hour ten and ends at hour twenty-one, then begins the next day at hour eight and ends at hour twenty. The horizontal lines are not always continuous, and there are some small sections of horizontal line during the non-active times, but the data are fairly consistent with the above parameters.\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/70be509e6c7000b86c83cd872c4dc95f/original.png\" width=\"365\"></p>\n\n<p>Figure 3.
