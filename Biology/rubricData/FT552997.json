The column headers are Organelle, Structure 1 point per box, Maximum 2 points, and Function 1 point per box, Maximum 2 points. The table reads as follows, row-wise. Row 1, Organelle: Mitochondria; Structure: Indicate two membranes with either (with either is underlined), A sublist below reads as follows, infolding of the inner membrane, cristae, or matrix; Function: cellular or aerobic respiration (Krebs, E T S), production of A T P, release of chemical energy. Row 2, Organelle: Chloroplasts; Structure: Indicate two membranes with either (with either is underlined), A sublist below reads as follows, flattened sacs (thylakoids), flattened stacks (grana), stroma; Function: photosynthesis or description of photosynthesis, production of 3-Carbon molecules (sugars, P G A L, glucose). Row 3, Organelle: Endoplasmic Reticulum (E R); Structure: interconnected membranes, vesicles or sacs, rough E R has attached ribosomes and/or smooth E R without ribosomes; Function: synthesis of lipids (for example, steroids) and/or proteins, detoxification of poisons, alcohol, transport, calcium signaling/storage, If rough and smooth E R are the two named organelles, synthesis of proteins. Row 4, Organelle: Golgi apparatus; Structure: series of flattened sacs; Function: modification of molecules, packaging molecules, processing molecules, vesicles (sacs) and their contents can be targeted for various locations in the cell and to its exterior. Row 5, Organelle: Lysosome; Structure: vesicle (bag, sac) with enzymes; Function: digestion or breakdown of molecules waste materials and food with digestive enzymes (for example, nucleases), cell lysis, recycling organelles. Row 6, Organelle: Peroxisome (glyoxysomes); Structure: vesicle (bag, sac) with enzymes; Function: breakdown or detoxify free radicals or peroxides. Row 7, Organelle: Vacuoles; Structure: vesicle (bag, sac); Function: water balance, turgidity, storage water, ions, nutrients, or waste. Row 8, Organelle: Contractile vacuole; Structure: vesicle (bag, sac); Function: expulsion of water from cell. Row 9, Organelle: Vesicles; Structure: sac (bag, sac); Function: transporting materials to/from E R, Golgi, or cell membrane. Row 10, Organelle: Leucoplast; Structure: Indicate two membranes with starch; Function: storing starch. Row 11, Organelle: Chromoplast; Structure: Indicate two membranes with pigments; Function: storing pigments.\"></p>"]}]
