The table reads as follows, row-wise. Row 1, Description of change in abiotic condition: Increase in soil quantity; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): More detritus increases humus; decreased erosion because more plants hold soil in place; Explanation (why it enhances succession): Provides more anchoring for plants. Row 2, Description of change in abiotic condition: Improvement in soil quality; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Soil gains organic matter (humus); Explanation (why it enhances succession): Provides more nutrients for plant growth. Row 3, Description of change in abiotic condition: More N available to ecosystem; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Caused by decomposition and/or by nitrogen fixation. Explanation (why it enhances succession): Favors plants with higher nitrogen needs. Row 4, Description of change in abiotic condition: More P available; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Caused by decomposition; Explanation (why it enhances succession): Favors plants with higher phosphorus needs. Row 5, Description of change in abiotic condition: Increase in water retained in soil; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Increased organic matter retains water; increased shading reduces evaporation from the soil; Explanation (why it enhances succession): More water is available for plants. Row 6, Description of change in abiotic condition: Decrease in p H of soil; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Acids released during decomposition lower pH; Explanation (why it enhances succession): Mobilizes cations facilitating mineral uptake (for example, Ferrous cation Calcium cation); favors acid-tolerant plants. Row 7, Description of change in abiotic condition: Increase in p H of soil; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Soil gets more basic with increase in ammonia (N H 3); Explanation (why it enhances succession): Favors plants with higher N requirement; favors alkaline-tolerant plants. Row 8, Description of change in abiotic condition: Decrease in light availability; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Caused by shading; Explanation (why it enhances succession): Increased shading favors shade-tolerant species; inhibits shade-intolerant species. Row 9, Description of change in abiotic condition: Decrease in temperature; Explanation (why abiotic condition changes): Caused by shading; Explanation (why it enhances succession): Favors species that are not heat tolerant; inhibits plants needing higher temperatures.
