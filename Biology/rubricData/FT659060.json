The column headers are Predicted consequences on animal community (1 point) and Justification of prediction (1 point). The table reads as follows row-wise.  Row 1: Predicted consequences on animal community: Harm / Death to animals; Justification of prediction Exposure to toxic chemicals, Toxic chemicals accumulate through the food chain Persist in the environment, and Contaminated groundwater.  Row 2, Predicted consequences on animal community: Emigration and Displacement; Justification of prediction: Loss of habitat and/or food, Loss of access, and Exposure to toxic chemicals.
