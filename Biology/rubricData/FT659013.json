The column headers are Definition/Explanation of the Idea (1 point), Description of How It Has Enhanced/Modified Interpretation of Evolution (1 point) Bullet: Direct mention of Darwin’s view is not necessary for points., and Depth of Discussion /Expansion Point (1 point) Witha bulleted list that reads: Discuss evidence, Deeper description of the theory, and Describe applicable technology. The table reads as follows, row-wise. Row 1, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: Definition/Explanation of the Idea - Allele (gene) frequency remains constant over time, Under certain conditions no evolution occurs; Description of How It Has Enhanced/Modified Interpretation of Evolution - D - Ongoing gradual change, H W - Constant allele ratio (must refer to alleles or genes), Hardy-Weinberg equation  (equation is underlined) without explanation of variables within equation equals no points; Depth of Discussion /Expansion Point - Examples: Five (underlined) conditions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium cited correctly (need all 5). A sublist below reads as follows, Very large population size - no drift, No movement in or out of a population, No net mutations, Random mating - no sexual selection, and No natural selection.
