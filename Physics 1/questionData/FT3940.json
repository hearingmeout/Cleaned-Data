The left graph has a pattern of four similar sections. Each section starts at the horizontal axis, rises to a maximum value, is concave down and returns to the horizontal axis. The maximum height of each section decreases as the values for time increase. The first section of the right graph starts almost at the top of the vertical axis and drops steeply to the horizontal axis. The next four sections follow a pattern. Each section starts at the horizontal axis, rises to a maximum value that is less than the starting height of the first section, is concave down and returns to the horizontal axis.
