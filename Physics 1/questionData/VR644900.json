There is a pivot on the right end of the rod. There are 2 forces of magnitude 2 F and 2 forces of magnitude 3 F being exerted on the rod. One of the 2F forces is exerted upward at a distance one quarter of the full length from the left end of the rod. The second 2F force is exerted downward at a distance a quarter of the full length of the rod from the right end of the rod. The  two 3F forces are exerted at the half-way point of the rod. One of them is exerted straight up and the other is exerted straight down.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR644900.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In addition to the force from the pivot, at the instant shown in the top-view figure a horizontal rod has four forces exerted on it with the magnitudes and locations indicated. The rod is free to rotate about a pivot at its right end. A student claims that the rod is in rotational equilibrium. Is the claim correct?
