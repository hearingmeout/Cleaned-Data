Each diagram shows a horizontally oriented spring inside a launcher, with a vertical plate attached to the right end of the spring. Toward the center and at the bottom of the launcher, three evenly spaced tick marks, labeled A, B, and C, are drawn. An arrow indicates that the tick marks represent pins. The first figure is labeled “Figure 1, Uncompressed spring.” In the diagram for Figure 1, the spring with the attached plate is uncompressed and its length extends from the left side of the launcher to the right of tick mark C. The second figure is labeled “Figure 2, Compressed spring.” In the diagram for Figure 2, the spring with the attached plate is compressed and its length extends from the left side of the launcher to tick mark C.
