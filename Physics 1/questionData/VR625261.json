[{"id":"VR625261","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A puck is sliding with constant speed across a smooth, horizontal surface with negligible friction. The puck then reaches a rough, horizontal section with non-negligible friction. A student claims that the translational kinetic energy of the object will be increasing when it is sliding on the rough section.
