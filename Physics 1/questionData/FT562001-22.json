The bumps are evenly spaced a distance d apart, as shown in the figure above. The track is actually much longer than shown, with over 100 bumps. A cart of mass M is released from rest at the top of the track. A student notices that after reaching the 40th bump the cart’s average speed between successive bumps no longer increases, reaching a maximum value v<sub>avg</sub>. This means the time interval taken to move from one bump to the next bump becomes constant.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Consider the cart’s motion between bump 41 and bump 44.</p>\n\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>In the figure below, sketch a graph of the cart’s velocity v as a function of time from the moment it reaches bump 41 until the moment it reaches bump 44.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Over the same time interval, draw a dashed horizontal line at v = v<sub>avg</sub>.
