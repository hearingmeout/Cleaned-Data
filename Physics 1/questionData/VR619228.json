There is a force on the ball from the string directed up and to the left, and a downward gravitational force. There is also a constant flow of air around the ball, and the vector sum of all the forces exerted on the ball is equal to zero. Which of the following statements correctly indicates a possible direction of the force exerted on the ball by the air, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR619228_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">To the right, because it will balance the leftward component of the force from the string</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">To the right, because it will balance the downward gravitational force</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Down and to the left, because it will balance the force from the string</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Down and to the left, because it will balance the downward gravitational force</p>"],"answer":0}]
