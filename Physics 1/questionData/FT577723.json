The incline is in the shape of a right triangle and slopes downward and to the left. The angle formed by the incline and the horizontal is labeled 30 degrees. Two arrows, both labeled ^F,&quot; are drawn extending from the center of the block. One arrow extends vertically upward and one arrow extends horizontally to the left. A dashed arrow is drawn parallel to the incline, representing movement down and to the left along the incline. A dashed-line block is shown at the bottom of the ramp, indicating the block's position at some time after it has been released from rest.
