A force of magnitude <em>F</em> is exerted on the crate at an angle <em>θ</em> to the horizontal, as shown in the figure above, causing the crate to slide to the right. The surface exerts a normal force of magnitude <em>F<sub>N</sub></em> on the crate. As the crate slides a distance <em>d</em>, it gains an amount of kinetic energy ∆<em>K</em>. While <em>F</em> is kept constant, the angle <em>θ</em> is now doubled but is still less than 90<sup>o</sup>.
