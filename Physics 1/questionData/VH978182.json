The meterstick can slide through the cradle so that the horizontal position of a point on the meterstick can be changed in the horizontal direction. Students may hang objects of various masses from the meterstick, as shown in the figure. The students notice that when the meterstick-cradle-object-object system is not balanced, the meterstick will rotate.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The system will rotate in the clockwise direction with a constant angular speed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The system will rotate in the clockwise direction with an increasing angular speed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The system will rotate in the counterclockwise direction with a constant angular speed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The system will rotate in the counterclockwise direction with an increasing angular speed.</p>"],"answer":1}]
