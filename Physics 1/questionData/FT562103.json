[{"id":"FT562103","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"A cart of mass m is moving with negligible friction along a track with known speed <em>v<sub>1</sub></em> to the right. It collides with and sticks to a cart of mass 4<em>m</em> moving with known speed <em>v<sub>2</sub></em> to the right. Which of the two principles, conservation of momentum and conservation of mechanical energy, must be applied to determine the final speed of the carts, and why?","choicesHtml":["<p>Only conservation of momentum, because the momentum lost by one cart is gained by the other and there is only one unknown quantity.</p>","<p>Both conservation of mechanical energy and conservation of momentum, because both principles apply in any collision.</p>","<p>Both conservation of mechanical energy and conservation of momentum, because neither cart changes direction.</p>","<p>Either conservation of momentum or conservation of mechanical energy, because only one equation is required to solve for the one unknown variable.</p>"],"answer":-1}]
