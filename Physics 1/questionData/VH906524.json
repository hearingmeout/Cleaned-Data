The students use a setup that consists of a cart of known mass connected to one end of a string that is looped over a pulley of negligible friction, with its other end connected to a hanging mass. The cart is initially at rest on a horizontal surface and rolls without slipping when released. The inertia of the cart's wheels is negligible. Students have access to common laboratory equipment to make measurements of components of the system.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of a line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane.
