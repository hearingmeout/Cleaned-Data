A student draws the force diagram for brick 2, as shown above. The forces are an upward normal force, a downward force exerted by brick 1, and a downward gravitational force. How many of the forces, if any, in the force diagram are contact forces caused by microscopic interactions?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH907164_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Zero</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Only one</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Only two</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">All three</p>"],"answer":2}]
