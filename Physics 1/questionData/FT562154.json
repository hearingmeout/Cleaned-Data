The student uses the apparatus shown in the figure above, consisting of two disks that are glued together and mounted on a horizontal axle. Blocks of varying mass are hung from a string wound around the smaller disk. The blocks are released from rest, exerting different torques on the disks, and are allowed to fall a fixed distance. For each block, the time of fall <em>t</em> and the final angular velocity <em>ω<sub>f</sub></em> of the disks are measured. There is considerable friction between the disks and the axle.
