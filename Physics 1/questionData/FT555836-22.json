A student is asked to predict whether the final position of the block will be twice as far at <em>x = 6D</em>. The student reasons that since the spring will be compressed twice as much as before, the block will have more energy when it leaves the spring, so it will slide farther along the track before stopping at position <em>x = 6D.</em></p>\n\n<p>b)</p>\n\n<p>i.
