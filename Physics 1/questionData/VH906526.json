The students use a setup that consists of a cart of known mass connected to one end of a string that is looped over a pulley of negligible friction, with its other end connected to a hanging mass. The cart is initially at rest on a horizontal surface and rolls without slipping when released. The inertia of the cart's wheels is negligible. Students have access to common laboratory equipment to make measurements of components of the system.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tension and the acceleration will double.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tension will double, but the acceleration will stay the same.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tension will stay the same, but the acceleration will double.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tension and the acceleration will stay the same.</p>"],"answer":1}]
