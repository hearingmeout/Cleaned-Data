The magnitude of the force is initially 5 N, and the block moves at a constant velocity. While the block is moving, the force is instantaneously increased to 12 N. How much kinetic energy does the block now gain as it moves a distance of 2 m?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>10 J</p>","<p>14 J</p>","<p>24 J</p>","<p>34 J</p>"],"answer":0}]
