The student holds weights out with extended arms and the teacher gives the student a push to cause the student to begin spinning on the platform with constant angular velocity. While spinning, the student pulls the weights in toward the student’s body. Which of the following correctly describes how the angular momentum of the student‑weights system changes, if at all, when the weights are pulled in and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR684288_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular momentum increases, because the student transfers energy to the weights.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular momentum increases, because the angular speed of the student will increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular momentum remains constant, because no energy is transferred to the system.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular momentum remains constant, because no external net torque is exerted on the system.</p>"],"answer":3}]
