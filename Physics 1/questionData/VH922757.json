The two diagrams are labeled Figure 1 and Figure 2. Figure 1 is titled “Experiment 1, Ball Released from Rest,” and shows a ball in midair, to the right of the top of a table. There are two graphs below Figure 1, titled “Position vs Time Graphs for Experiment 1.” The first graph shows 6 data points and a best fit curve line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “t, in seconds,” and the numbers 0 through 0.6, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “x, in meters,” and the numbers 0.0 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The 6 data points on the best fit curve line are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Point 1: 0 seconds, comma 0.0 meters. Point 2: 0.1 second, comma 0.0 meters. Point 3: 0.2 second, comma 0.0 meters. Point 4: 0.3 second, comma 0.0 meters. Point 5: 0.4 second, comma 0.0 meters. Point 6: 0.5 second, comma 0.0 meters. The second graph shows 6 data points on a best fit curve line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “t, in seconds,” and the numbers 0 through 0.6, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “y, in meters,” and the numbers 0.0 through 1.6, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The 6 data points on the best fit curve line are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Point 1: 0 seconds, 1.5 meters. Point 2: 0.1 second, 1.45 meters. Point 3: 0.2 second, 1.35 meters. Point 4: 0.3 second, 1.05 meters. Point 5: 0.4 second, 0.75 meter. Point 6: 0.5 second, 0.3 meter. Figure 2 is titled “Experiment 2, Ball Horizontally Rolls off Table,” and shows a ball on the top right edge of a table, with a rightward pointing arrow drawn from it. There are two graphs below Figure 2, titled “Position vs Time Graphs for Experiment 2.” The first graph shows 6 data points and a best fit curve line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled “t, in seconds,” and the numbers 0 through 0.6, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “x, in meters,” and the numbers 0.0 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The 6 data points on the best fit curve line are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Point 1: 0 seconds, 0.0 meters. Point 2: 0.1 second, 0.2 meter. Point 3: 0.2 second, 0.4 meter. Point 4: 0.3 second, 0.6 meter. Point 5: 0.4 second, 0.8 meter. Point 6: 0.5 second, 1.0 meter. The second graph shows 6 data points and a best fit curve line in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane.

In Experiment 1, the student releases a ball from rest and uses a slow-motion camera to film the ball as it falls to the ground. Using video analysis, the student is able to plot the ball’s horizontal position <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x\"><math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and vertical position <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"y\"><math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> as a function of time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>. In Experiment 2, the student horizontally rolls the same ball off a table, and uses video analysis to plot the ball’s horizontal position <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x\"><math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and vertical position <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"y\"><math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> as a function of time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> starting from the instant the ball leaves the table.
