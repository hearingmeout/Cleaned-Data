In the experiment, frictional forces CANNOT be neglected. The student uses experimental data to create two graphs. Figure 1 is a graph of kinetic energy of the object as a function of time. Figure 2 is a graph of the object-Earth system’s gravitational potential energy as a function of time. How should the student use one or both graphs to determine how much the total mechanical energy changes after <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"5 seconds\"><math alttext=\"5 seconds\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>5</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mtext>s</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> ?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH972473_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Calculate the magnitude of the difference between the final kinetic energy of the object and the final kinetic energy of the object by using the graph in Figure 1.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Calculate the magnitude of the difference between the final gravitational potential energy of the system and the initial gravitational potential energy of the system by using the graph in Figure 2.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Calculate the magnitude of the difference between the final kinetic energy of the object found from the graph in Figure 1 and the final gravitational potential energy of the object-Earth system found from the graph in Figure 2.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Calculate the magnitude of the difference between the final kinetic energy of the object found from the graph in Figure 1 and the initial gravitational potential energy of the object-Earth system found from the graph in Figure 2.</p>"],"answer":3}]
