There are 3 forces exerted in the diagram, starting from a dot. The dot is placed at the center of a 6-by-6 square grid, which is is rotated counterclockwise less than 45 degrees from the horizontal. An xy coordinate system is indicated aligned with the grid and rotated by the same amount. One of the forces is 3 units along the positive x-axis. The second force is 3 units along the positive y-axis. The third force is going straight down, such that it ends at a point that is approximately 3 units in the negative y-direction and 1.5 units in the negative x-direction.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR858935.g03.svg\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"positive x\"><math alttext=\"positive x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></math></span></span> direction</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"negative x\"><math alttext=\"negative x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></math></span></span> direction</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"positive y\"><math alttext=\"positive y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>+</mo><mi>y</mi></math></span></span> direction</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"negative y\"><math alttext=\"negative y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>-</mo><mi>y</mi></math></span></span> direction</p>"],"answer":0}]
