The top end of the string is attached to a horizontal surface, and the other end of the string is attached to the sphere. The sphere is shown at three positions. At position 1, the string slants downward and to the left. At position 2, the string is vertical. At the third position, which is unlabeled, the string slants downward and to the right. The sphere is at its lowest position when at position 2. Axes show that to the right represents the positive horizontal direction, and up represents positive vertical direction.\" height=\"188\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH976794.g04.png\" width=\"265\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents the graph of a sinusoidal curve in the coordinate plane in quadrants one and four.
