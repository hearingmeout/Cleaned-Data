[{"id":"VH910268","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Two experiments are performed on an object to determine how much the object resists a change in its state of motion while at rest and while in motion. In the first experiment, the object is pushed with a constant known force along a horizontal surface. There is negligible friction between the surface and the object. A motion sensor is used to measure the speed of the object as it is pushed. In a second experiment, the object is tied to a string and pulled upward with a constant known force, and a motion sensor is used to measure the speed of the object as it is pulled upward. The student uses the data collected from the motion sensor to determine the mass of the object in both experiments. Which of the following classifies the type of mass that was determined in each experiment?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH910268_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Experiment 1 </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Experiment 2 </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Gravitational mass </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Gravitational mass </td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Experiment 1 </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Experiment 2 </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Inertial mass </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Gravitational mass </td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Experiment 1 </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Experiment 2 </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Gravitational mass </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Inertial mass </td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"></p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Experiment 1 </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Experiment 2 </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Inertial mass </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Inertial mass </td></tr></tbody></table></div>"],"answer":1}]
