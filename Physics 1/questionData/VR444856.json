The meterstick has tick marks indicating each tenth of a meter. Identical forces of magnitude F sub 0 are applied to the meterstick at three locations. Two forces are each applied toward the bottom of the page at 0.1 meter and at 0.9 meter, respectively, from the left end of the meterstick. One force is applied toward the top of the page at 0.6 meter from the left end of the meterstick. Four points labeled A through D are indicated at the following locations, all indicated from the left end of the meterstick. Point A is at 0.3 meter. Point B is at 0.4 meter. Point C is at 0.6 meter.
