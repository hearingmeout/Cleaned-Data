The horizontal axis is labeled &quot;Time, in seconds,&quot; and the numbers 0 through 6, in increments of 1, are indicated.

The line has small amounts of scatter, making the line appear slightly jagged. The line begins at approximately 0 seconds, 0 newtons and moves generally upward and to the right until it reaches approximately 2 seconds, 10 newtons. It then moves horizontally and to the right until it reaches approximately 4 seconds, 10 newtons. It then moves upward and to the right until it ends at approximately 6 seconds, 19 newtons. \" height=\"219\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d8ae7375b8404081199ae9adbf513bf6/original.png\" width=\"250\" /></p>\n\n<p>During an experiment a student records the net horizontal force exerted on an object moving in a straight line along a horizontal frictionless track.
