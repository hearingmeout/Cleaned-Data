The elevator is accelerating upward with constant acceleration and the block is initially at rest with respect to the elevator. The block is then displaced a distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>D</mi></math></span></span> from equilibrium and released from rest at time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t equals 0\"><math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math></span></span>. A motion detector on the floor of the elevator records the distance of the block from the motion detector as a function of time, which is represented in the graph on the right. The elevator then comes to rest and the block is returned to its equilibrium position. The block is again displaced a distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"D\"><math alttext=\"D\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>D</mi></math></span></span> from equilibrium and released from rest. Which of the following correctly indicates how the position-time graph of the block would be different, if at all, than the graph above, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR718739_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The graph would shift upward, because the equilibrium position has shifted upward and the spring constant remains the same.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The graph would shift upward, because the spring constant has increased.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The graph would be compressed horizontally, because the block has a smaller effective mass.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The graph would be compressed horizontally, because the spring constant has decreased.</p>"],"answer":0}]
