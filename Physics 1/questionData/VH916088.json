Then measure the force required to keep each object at a constant speed by using a force sensor, and record the mass of each object by using a mass scale. Perform this experiment multiple times with objects of different masses.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Place an object on a rough surface so that the object is at rest. Use a force sensor to exert a force on the object until just after the object overcomes the force of static friction. Record this force. Repeat the experiment for objects of different masses.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Slide an object of known mass across a rough surface, using a constant applied force that can be measured by a force sensor. Place a motion detector behind the object so that its speed can be measured as it slides across the surface. Repeat the experiment for different applied forces.</p>"],"answer":3}]
