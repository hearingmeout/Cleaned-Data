The left side of the block is attached to a horizontal spring that extends from a wall at the left end of the surface. Block 1 is held at rest about a quarter of the way along the surface. There are 3 points indicated on the surface labeled A, B, and C. Point A is approximately one fourth of the way along the surface, at the midpoint of the bottom side of block 1. Point B is approximately halfway along the surface, and a dashed vertical line is drawn through it. A rightward pointing arrow labeled positive x extends from the vertical line.

Friction between block 1 and the surface is negligible. Block 1 is held at rest at point A, to the left of point B which is the equilibrium position of the spring-block system, as shown in the figure. Block 1 is then released and allowed to oscillate. Some time later, block 1 is momentarily at rest at point C. Consider the positive horizontal direction to be toward the right.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:A part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"A\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) The dot below represents block 1 just after it is released.
