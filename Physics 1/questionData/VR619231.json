A rope extending horizontally to the right is attached to the right side of the left block, such that it is not touching the right block.

The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the vertical axis is labeled “F sub 2 m, comma m, end sub.” The line segment begins on the vertical axis, one unit above the origin, and slants upward and to the right. It passes through a point 3 units to the right of the vertical axis and 2 units above the horizontal axis.
