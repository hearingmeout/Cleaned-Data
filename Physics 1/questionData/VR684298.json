The sphere rolls down the incline without slipping, while the ice cube slides down the incline with negligible friction. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the sphere or the cube has the greater translational speed when it reaches the bottom of the incline, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR684298_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The sphere, because its rolling motion will contribute to its translational motion, while the cube does not have any rolling motion.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The sphere, because work is done on the sphere by both gravity and friction, while only gravity does work on the cube.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The cube, because the cube’s kinetic energy will all be in the form of translational kinetic energy, while some of the sphere’s kinetic energy will be in the form of rotational kinetic energy.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The cube, because none of the mechanical energy of the cube will be dissipated by friction, while some of the mechanical energy of the sphere will be dissipated by friction.</p>"],"answer":2}]
