From the point of view of an observer on either planet, the planets appear to orbit each other while also orbiting the star. The dots on the orbits represent the position of the planets at time<em> t</em><sub>0</sub>, and <em>X</em> is the position of their center of mass at that time. Which of the following arrows best represents the acceleration of the center of mass of the double-planet system when it is at point <em>X</em> ?</p>","choicesHtml":["<img alt=\"An arrow points steeply down and to the left.\" height=\"76\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/6084bc2037c5c0ad9794f55d63284044/original.png\" width=\"70\">","<img alt=\"An arrow points slightly down and to the left.\" height=\"39\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/c59e7d610572533c840876a10cf09670/original.png\" width=\"70\">","<img alt=\"An arrow points up and to the left at about a 45 degree angle.\" height=\"61\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/ae837fed069c582851b9cb293bd062d1/original.png\" width=\"70\">","<img alt=\"An arrow points up and to the right at about a 45 degree angle.\" height=\"82\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d7c86b3dc3fc199b519154b158793b11/original.png\" width=\"70\">"],"answer":-1}]
