A disk slides along the surface toward the right end of the rod in the direction indicated in the figure. When the disk reaches the rod, it sticks to the rod, and the disk and the rod rotate together about the left end of the rod. Friction forces, except those between the disk and the rod, are negligible. Which of the following correctly states whether the angular momentum of the disk-rod system changes as a result of the collision, and provides the best justification for the statement?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR684289_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the rod will begin rotating and the angular momentum will increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because only one component of the disk’s velocity will contribute to the system’s angular momentum and the angular momentum will decrease.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because angular momentum of all systems is always constant.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the torques exerted on the rod and the disk are internal to the system.</p>"],"answer":3}]
