The blocks are then separated and connected by a light spring, as shown in trial 2. The spring is compressed and the blocks are again released from rest on the ramp. Immediately after the blocks are released, is the net force on the two-block system the same or different between trial 1 and trial 2? Immediately after the blocks are released, is the net force on block Y the same or different between trial 1 and trial 2?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR444843_rubric","choicesHtml":["<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\">Force on System</th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Force on Block Y</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Different</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Different</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\">Force on System</th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Force on Block Y</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">Different</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">The same</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\">Force on System</th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Force on Block Y</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">The same</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Different</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","<div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:2\"><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\">Force on System</th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Force on Block Y</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">The same</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">The same</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"],"answer":2}]
