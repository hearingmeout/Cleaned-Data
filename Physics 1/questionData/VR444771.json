The cyclist begins near the top of the ramp, at the left side of the figure. The ramp moves steeply downward and to the right until it levels off and reaches a minimum on the ground. It then moves upward and to the right until it ends at a vertical distance of H sub 0 from the top of the ramp. The angle formed by the ramp and the horizontal at the end of the ramp measures theta sub 0. To the right of where the ramp ends is a row of six cars placed side by side. Directly to the right of the last car is a second ramp that begins at the same height as where the first ramp ended. It extends downward and to the right until it ends. The horizontal distance between the two ramps is X sub 0. A dashed curve that opens downward extends from the end of the first ramp to the beginning of the second ramp, showing the cyclist’s movement over the row of cars. A note states that the figure is not drawn to scale.\" height=\"171\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR444771.g06.png\" width=\"585\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">(7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">A stunt cyclist builds a ramp that will allow the cyclist to coast down the ramp and jump over several parked cars, as shown above.
