The velocity of the ball as it leaves the kicker's foot is 20 meters per second at a angle of 37<sup>o</sup> above the horizontal. The top of the fence is 2.5 meters high. The kicker's foot is in contact with the ball for 0.05 second. The ball hits nothing while in flight and air resistance is negligible.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(a) Determine the magnitude of the average net force exerted on the ball during the kick.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Determine the time it takes for the ball to reach the plane of the fence.</p>\n\n<p>(c) Will the ball hit the fence? If so, how far below the top of the fence will it hit? If not, how far above the top of the fence will it pass?</p>\n\n<p>(d) On the axes below, sketch the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity of the ball as functions of time until the ball reaches the plane of the fence.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img alt=\"The figure shows two identical sets of axes. The y-axis is velocity in meters per second, and has tick marks above and below the origin in increments of 1 meter per second to plus and minus 20 meters per second. Every fifth tick mark is labelled. The x-axis is time in seconds, and has tick marks to the right of the origin in increments of 0.1 second to 5 seconds. Every fifth tick mark is labelled. Horizontal dashed lines are drawn from the labelled tick marks on the y-axis and vertical dashed lines are drawn from the labelled tick marks on the x-axis, forming a dashed grid on the graph. The top graph is for the horizontal component of the velocity, and the bottom graph is for the vertical component of the velocity.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/514f289e45f47c0fa9fa9df1ddf83210/original.png\">"}]
