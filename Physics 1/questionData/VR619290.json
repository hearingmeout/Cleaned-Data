Why or why not?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR619290_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the centripetal force always points toward the center of the circular motion.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the speed of the cart is increasing so there must be a nonzero net force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the cart has both a tangential acceleration parallel to the track and a centripetal acceleration perpendicular to the track.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the speed is increasing and therefore the net force is directed to the right.</p>"],"answer":2}]
