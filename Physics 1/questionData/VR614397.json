The driver is applying the brakes and the truck is slowing down. In the back of the truck, a box is at rest relative to the truck and it remains stationary relative to the truck without slipping. A student draws a free-body diagram to represent the forces acting on the box, as shown in the right figure. Another student looks at the diagram and claims that it is not correct. Which of the following correctly indicates an error in the diagram?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR614397_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The normal force should be directed vertically upward because it always opposes the gravitational force.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The magnitude of the gravitational force should be equal to the magnitude of the normal force because the normal force on an object is always equal to the object’s weight.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The magnitude of the friction force should be smaller than that of the normal force because the coefficient of static friction is always less than <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span>.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The friction force should be directed up the ramp because the box is slowing down and therefore the acceleration of the box is opposite its direction of motion.</p>"],"answer":3}]
