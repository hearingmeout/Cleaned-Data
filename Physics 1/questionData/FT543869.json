When the spring in the toy is compressed a distance x from its uncompressed length <em>L<sub>0</sub></em> and the toy is released, the top of the toy rises to a maximum height <em>h</em> above the point of maximum compression. The students repeat the experiment several times, measuring <em>h</em> with objects of various masses taped to the top of the toy so that the combined mass of the toy and added objects is <em>m</em>. The bottom of the toy and the spring each have negligible mass compared to the top of the toy and the objects taped to it.</p>\n\n<p>(a) Derive an expression for the height h in terms of m, x, k, and fundamental constants.</p>\n\n<p>With the spring compressed a distance <em>x</em> = 0.020 m in each trial, the students obtained the following data for different values of <em>m</em>.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">m (kg)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">h (m)</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.020</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.49</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.030</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.34</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.040</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.28</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.050</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.19</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.060</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">0.18</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(b)</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What quantities should be graphed so that the slope of a best-fit straight line through the data points can be used to calculate the spring constant <em>k</em>?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fill in one or both of the blank columns in the table with calculated values of your quantities, including units.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(c) On the axes below, plot your data and draw a best-fit straight line.
