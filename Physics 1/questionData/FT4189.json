On the horizontal surface a small block labeled m is above a larger block labeled 2m. On the right side of each block is an arrow pointing horizontally to the right. Both arrows are the same size and both are labeled F. The graph in the first quadrant has a horizontal axis labeled t, in units of seconds and increments of one, and the vertical axis is labeled F, in units of newtons and has one labeled coordinate of five point zero. The intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is labeled O. The graph starts at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes and moves along the horizontal axis to just before the coordinate 1 second, where it curves up quickly and travels vertically to the coordinate one second, five point zero newtons. The graph then goes horizontally to the right and stays constant until 2 seconds where it curves down and travels vertically to zero newtons just after 2 seconds where it curves quickly and goes horizontal.
