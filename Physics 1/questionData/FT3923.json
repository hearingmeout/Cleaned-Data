After several seconds, the gazelle notices the lion and accelerates directly toward him, hoping to pass the lion and force him to reverse direction. As the gazelle accelerates toward and past the lion, the lion changes direction and accelerates in pursuit of the gazelle. The lion and the gazelle eventually each reach constant but different speeds. Which of the following sets of graphs shows a reasonable representation of the velocities of the lion and the gazelle as functions of time?</p>","choicesHtml":["<img alt=\"Each option consists of two graphs in the first and fourth quadrants.
