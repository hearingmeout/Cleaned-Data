The rope pulls the crate to the right across a rough horizontal surface at a constant speed. The free-body diagram on the right shows the forces exerted on the crate at the instant shown on the left. As the crate moves across the surface, the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the surface increases but the speed of the crate remains constant. Which of the following free-body diagrams could show the forces exerted on the crate a short time later, after the coefficient of friction has increased?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR614373_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows a free-body diagram with four arrows of varying sizes extending from a common point on a coordinate grid.
