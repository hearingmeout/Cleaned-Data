In both graphs, the horizontal axis is labeled “Time.” Ten vertical gridlines are drawn at equal intervals along the horizontal axis. In the first graph, the vertical axis is labeled “Horizontal Velocity,” and in the second graph, the vertical axis is labeled “Vertical Velocity.” In both graphs, eight horizontal gridlines are drawn at equal intervals along the vertical axis, such that four are above the horizontal axis and four are below the horizontal axis. In the first graph, the line begins on the vertical axis, with a horizontal velocity at the second horizontal gridline above the horizontal axis, and extends horizontally to the right until it ends above the end of the horizontal axis. In the second graph, the line begins on the vertical axis, with a vertical velocity at the third horizontal gridline above the horizontal axis, and extends downward and to the right. It crosses the horizontal axis halfway between the fourth and fifth vertical gridlines and ends at a point that is at the third horizontal gridline below the horizontal axis and the ninth vertical gridline to the right of the vertical axis.\" height=\"147\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR443397.g28.png\" width=\"445\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\"><span style=\"font-size:1.1em;\">An object is subject to multiple forces that result in the object having horizontal and vertical velocity components <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"v sub x\"><math alttext=\"v sub x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"v sub y\"><math alttext=\"v sub y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></math></span></span>, respectively as a function of time, as shown.
