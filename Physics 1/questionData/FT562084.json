In Figure 1, the student pushes the box up an incline with negligible friction. In Figure 2, the student lifts the box straight up from ground level to the loading dock platform. In which case does the student do more work on the box, and why?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>Lifting the box straight up, because it requires a larger applied force to lift it straight up</p>","<p>Pushing the box up the incline, because the force is applied for a longer distance</p>","<p>Lifting the box straight up, because the incline acts as a simple machine and reduces the force required</p>","<p>Neither method, because the work is the same in both cases, since using the ramp decreases the force by the same factor that it increases the distance</p>"],"answer":2}]
