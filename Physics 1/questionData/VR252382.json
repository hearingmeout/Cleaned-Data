The launcher consists of a rectangular plunger attached to a horizontal spring. Two vertical pins are attached to the right edge of the table to prevent the end of the plunger from extending beyond the surface of the table. Figure 1 shows the spring within the launcher at an uncompressed length, with the plunger about halfway out of the launcher. Figure 2 shows that the spring has been compressed by a distance of L, causing the plunger to retract fully. A block of mass m has been positioned against front of the plunger in preparation for launch.\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR252382.g01.png\" width=\"365\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">A spring-loaded launcher can be securely attached to a tabletop. When the spring is at its uncompressed length, the plunger is in the position shown above in Figure 1. A small wood block can be pressed against the end of the plunger, compressing the spring a distance <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L\"><math alttext=\"L\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, as shown in Figure 2. When the block is released, the plunger pushes the block along the tabletop. Two pins are attached to the edge of the table to prevent the plunger from extending beyond the table. When the plunger hits the pins, the block then leaves the table. There is nonnegligible friction between the block and the tabletop.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows two diagrams labeled Table 1 and Table 2, which show the spring-loaded launcher positioned further to the right along the table than in the figures above with the spring and plunger compressed, and a block placed against the plunger. In Table 1, the distance between the plunger and the pins at the right edge of the table is, s equals A, which is slightly less than the distance L that the spring is compressed. In Table 2, the distance between the plunger and the pins at the right edge of the table is, s equals B, which is significantly less than the distance L that the spring can be compressed.\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR252382.g02.png\" width=\"582\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The launcher can be moved closer to or farther from the edge of the tabletop.
