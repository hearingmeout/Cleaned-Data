The block is connected to an identical hanging block by a lightweight string that passes over an ideal pulley as shown. When the blocks are released from rest, the two-block system gains kinetic energy because work is done on the system. Which type of force or forces make a nonzero contribution to the net work done on the two-block system?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR444952_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gravitational force only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gravitational force and tension only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gravitational force and normal force only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Gravitational force, tension, and normal force</p>"],"answer":0}]
