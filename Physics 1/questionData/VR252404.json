When the satellite is at point A in the above figure, it fires a thruster (which exerts a force on the satellite) for a short time, modifying the orbital path.

In the modified orbit, the satellite’s speed at point A, after the thrusters were fired, is the same as it was in the original orbit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Consider the force exerted by the thruster at point A that modifies the satellite's orbit from the dashed-line original orbit to the solid-line new orbit.
