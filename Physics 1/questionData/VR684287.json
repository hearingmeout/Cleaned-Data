Two solid cylinders are placed inside the pipe at the locations shown. The pipe is given an initial angular speed, and the pipe-cylinders system rotates about the axle. As the system rotates, the cylinders slide toward the ends of the pipe. Which of the following correctly indicates how the angular speed of the system changes, if at all, as the cylinders slide and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR684287_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular speed decreases, because the rotational inertia of the system increases.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular speed decreases, because the rotational inertia of the system decreases.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular speed remains constant, because angular momentum is conserved.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The angular speed remains constant, because no external torque is exerted on the system.</p>"],"answer":0}]
