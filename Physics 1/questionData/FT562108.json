The meterstick has 9 evenly spaced tick marks that divide the meterstick into 10 equal intervals. From left to right, the first tickmark is labeled A, the fourth tick mark is labeled B, the sixth tick mark is labeled C, and the ninth tick mark is labeled D. The top point of the fulcrum touches the bottom of the meterstick at the fifth tick mark in the middle of the meterstick. A downward pointing arrow, labeled F, is drawn from the third tick mark. \" height=\"114\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/6eaa136884849a4f61d2e318bc94d042/original.png\" width=\"340\" /></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows a uniform meterstick that is set on a fulcrum at its center.
