The block moves down the slide and off the end of a table of height h<sub>2</sub> , landing on the floor a horizontal distance d from the edge of the table. Friction and air resistance are negligible. The overall height H of the setup is determined by the height of the room. Therefore, if h<sub>1</sub> is increased, h<sub>2</sub> must decrease by the same amount so that the sum h<sub>1</sub> + h<sub>2</sub> remains equal to H.
