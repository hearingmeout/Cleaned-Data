De plus, l‘espérance de vie s’allongeant quelque peu, au moins dans les classes aisées, apparaît un nouveau problème : la calvitié<sup>2</sup>. On trouve la solution dans l’apparition de la perruque, qui devient l’apanage<sup>3</sup> de la noblesse. A Versailes, l’abondance de la perruque révèle le rang social.</p>\n\n<p>La Révolution met un frein au règne incontesté de la perruque masculine. Le dix-neuvième siècle est celui des cheveux courts, même si les romantiques cultivent une juvénile chevelure longue. Et même si celle-ci redevient une marque exclusive de la féminité, la chevelure longue chez un homme est aussi le symbole affiché d’une certaine liberté d’esprit. Ce nouveau point de vue culmine dans la seconde moitiè du vingtième siècle avec l’entrée en scène des Beatles et des Rolling Stones.</p>\n\n<p>1 <em>crinière</em> : chevelure abondante</p>\n\n<p>2 <em>calvitié</em> : “baldness“</p>\n\n<p>3 <em>apanage</em> : privilège</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM French","Unit:3","Unit:2","Skill:Skill 3.A: Interpret the distinguishing features of a text.","Skill:Skill 3.B: Interpret the meaning of a text.","Skill Category:Skill Category 3: Interpret the content of written or audio text (words).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Task Model:Article and Chart"]},"cat":{"t":[307214,307215,307216,307217,307310,307314,307316],"f":{"Unit":["2"],"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Theme":["Personal and Public Identities"],"Task Model":["Article and Chart"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"],"Modes of Communication":["Interpretive Reading"],"Requires Culture Knowledge":["No"],"Geographic Region":["France"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT534720":{"id":"FT534720","q":{"id":"FT534720","t":"mcq","s":"<p>Selon le passage, quelle est la proportion d’accidents mortels causés par le manque de vigilance?</p>","o":[{"v":"i0","l":"<p>1/5</p>"},{"v":"i1","l":"<p>1/4</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p>1/3</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p>1/2</p>"}],"a":"i2","f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_132c3dd3ed3ebd772a75cc55fe7c4503","c":"<p>Directions: Read the following passage carefully.

Et ils savent tout ça grâce … à Astérix, dont la silhouette accompagne les pages du manuel que Mme Noucier-Jhele utilise pour les initier aux mystères de cette France si proche et si lointaine.</p>\n\n<p>Ah! la France… Ils en parlent comme d’une caverne d’Ali Baba, pleine de vins, de fromages, de parfums, de femmes à la mode, de garçons courtois, amoureux… Ils l’aiment cette France mythique, et ça se voit. Pourtant, Susi, Anton, Birgit, Sanne et leurs copains ne découvrent le français qu’en troisième langue. Car, en première langue, tous ont choisi d’apprendre … le latin ! Puis l’anglais, en deuxième langue, « of course, par nécessité utilitaire », selon l’expression de Sanne, qui met dans sa remarque une pointe de mépris pour cette langue « trop simple » … En les écoutant, on se dit que ces adolescents à la tête aussi bien pleine que bien faite sont les dignes héritiers de l’Europe d’Erasme et de Montaigne, les beaux rejetons de cette Europe qui se voulait déjà universelle et qui autorisait leur ancêtre Charles Quint, alors empereur d’Allemagne, prince des Pays-Bas, roi d’Espagne et de Sicile, à proclamer : « Je parle anglais aux commerçants, italien aux femmes, français aux hommes, espagnol à Dieu at allemand à mon cheval... »</p>\n\n<p>On se dit aussi qu’ils font forcément partie de ce que le Haut-Conseil de la francophonie appelle, dans son premier rapport <em>Etat de la francophonie dans le monde</em>, le « versant positif » de l’évolution de l’enseignement du français dans le monde, ce qui met en évidence la « généralité universelle » de l’enseignement du français. En dehors de la langue anglaise, seule la langue française est en effet offerte à l’apprentissage des jeunes et des adultes dans tous les pays du monde et l’Allemagne ne fait évidemment pas exception dans cette vision rassurante du paysage. Bien au contraire. Depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale, si deux pays ont beaucoup fait pour mieux se comprendre en développant leurs liens linguistiques dans leurs champs éducatifs respectifs, ce sont bien la France et l’Allemagne,</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\"><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\">From \"Bons baisers de Germering\" by Alain Roillat&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\"><em>Le Monde de l’Education</em>.<br>\nJuly- August 1996, N<sup>o</sup>. 239,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\">pp. 17-18.

Elle les ajustait sur ses oreilles et suivait ainsi les émissions du poste parisien ou d’autres stations. L’idée me vint un jour de récupérer au marché aux puces un micro que j’installai dans la salle à manger. Ma grand-mère était à l’écoute de son programme favori dans sa chambre. J’embarquai mon frère Guy et des copains pour pirater les émissions et . . . inventer une nouvelle radio dont ma grand-mère allait être, à son insu, l’unique auditrice.

Sa chanson terminée, ma mère retournait à ses occupations et nous donnions les dernières nouvelles. C’était systématiquement épouvantable. Guy (et je crois Jean Soubeyran) se relayaient pour annoncer des émeutes place de l’Opéra, la mort du pape, des coups de feu à la Bastille.

Mais ma grand-mère éprouvait de plus en plus de difficultés à lire à cause de sa vue, aussi avait-elle reporté son intérêt sur la radio, qu’elle écoutait presque toute la journée. Comme elle avait aussi des difficultés d’audition, mes frères et moi lui avions fabriqué un poste avec écouteurs. Elle les ajustait sur ses oreilles et suivait ainsi les émissions du poste parisien ou d’autres stations. L’idée me vint un jour de récupérer au marché aux puces un micro que j’installai dans la salle à manger. Ma grand-mère était à l’écoute de son programme favori dans sa chambre. J’embarquai mon frère Guy et des copains pour pirater les émissions et . . . inventer une nouvelle radio dont ma grand-mère allait être, à son insu, l’unique auditrice. C’est moi qui attaquais, d’une voix de « speaker » : —Voici maintenant notre quart d’heure consacré à la cuisine espagnole, en compagnie de M. Carlos Munera, chef cuisinier à l’ambassade d’Espagne! Je prenais alors l’accent ibérique des opérettes et me lançais dans une sauvage improvisation: —Auzourd’houi, yé vous propose la récette des crévettes à l’houile d’olive et au grouyère! L’imaginaire Carlos Munera expliquait doctement que si le gruyère n’était pas râpé « à l’espagnole », c’est-à-dire sans râpe mais avec des castagnettes, la recette serait ratée. Après quoi nous convoquions ma mère dans la salle à manger pour qu’elle chante devant le micro. J’annonçais : —Nous avons maintenant la joie d’accueillir dans notre studio . . . Édith Piaf, qui va nous interpréter un de ses derniers succès! Ma mère entonnait alors n’importe quelle chanson, mais avec une conviction efficace puisque mon frère Guy entendit ce cri du cœur de ma grand-mère, émue aux larmes: —Oh! Édith! Sa chanson terminée, ma mère retournait à ses occupations et nous donnions les dernières nouvelles. C’était systématiquement épouvantable.

Aujourd’hui, on est peut-être en train de connaître une rupture,» explique Jean-Luc Wingert, auteur du livre «La vie après le pétrole» (éditions Autrement). Une rupture qui, si elle se confirme, est lourde de conséquences pour l’avenir de notre société dont le pétrole est un des piliers. Une voiture, un crayon de couleur, l’aspirine, un détergent, un cosmétique (etc.!) ont tous un point en commun: «l’huile de pierre», comme disaient les Anciens. </p><p>D’où ces questions: peut-on vivre sans pétrole et comment, alors que dans quelques années, les deux tiers de la demande mondiale pourraient venir des pays dits «en développement»? Y a-t-il une ou des énergies de substitution, et lesquelles? Comment résoudre les problèmes d’environnement considérables que pose l’utilisation des énergies fossiles, à commencer par le réchauffement climatique?</p><p>Quel est l’état des réserves de pétrole mondiales?

Aujourd’hui, on est peut-être en train de connaître une rupture,» explique Jean-Luc Wingert, auteur du livre «La vie après le pétrole» (éditions Autrement). Une rupture qui, si elle se confirme, est lourde de conséquences pour l’avenir de notre société dont le pétrole est un des piliers. Une voiture, un crayon de couleur, l’aspirine, un détergent, un cosmétique (etc.!) ont tous un point en commun: «l’huile de pierre», comme disaient les Anciens. </p><p>D’où ces questions: peut-on vivre sans pétrole et comment, alors que dans quelques années, les deux tiers de la demande mondiale pourraient venir des pays dits «en développement»? Y a-t-il une ou des énergies de substitution, et lesquelles? Comment résoudre les problèmes d’environnement considérables que pose l’utilisation des énergies fossiles, à commencer par le réchauffement climatique?</p><p>Quel est l’état des réserves de pétrole mondiales?

Il présente un portrait satirique d'un bureaucrate intransigeant.</em></p><p></p><p><em>Il s'agit ici d’une pauvre marchande, Amaya, qui fait chaque jour le voyage de son village à la grande ville pour vendre avec très peu de profit des bananes, du savon, etc.</em></p><p></p><p>Fallait-il repartir au Beach demain pour cette histoire de carte d`identité perdue? Elle ne voyait vraiment pas comment s’en sortir. Elle était allée trois jours de suite au poste de police du Beach, trois jours de suite était revenue bredouille.* Aujourd’hui, elle s'était levée à cinq heures du matin afin de se trouver parmi les premières à passer; elle avait marché à grands pas comme à son habitude et à six heures et quart elle était devant le guichet de police, en troisième position sur la ﬁle d'attente. C'était son jour de chance aujourd'hui car le responsable du bureau arriva plus tôt que d'habitude, à dix heures. Le temps de ranger ses papiers, de classer des dossiers, de donner des ordres à ses subordonnés., il était onze heures; le tour d’Amaya arriva à onze heures trente. Elle pria intérieurement que le chef fût de bonne humeur.</p><p></p><p>- Qu’est-ce que tu veux? Demanda-t-il tout en arrangeant la médaille portant l’effigie du fondateur de parti, accroché à l’un des revers de sa veste.</p><p></p><p>-- Je reviens au sujet de ma carte d’identité que vous avez perdue.</p><p></p><p>- Je n’ai rien perdu du tout, tonna-t-il. Tout cela est arrivé par votre propre négligence.</p><p></p><p>- Ce sont vos services qui nous ont demandé de laisser les cartes et...</p><p></p><p>- Et quoi encore ? Vous n’avez qu’à ne pas obéir à des ordres absurdes!</p><p></p><p>- Mais ...</p><p></p><p>- Mais quoi?</p><p></p><p>- Non, monsieur camarade chef.</p><p></p><p>- Cette histoire de cartes d’identité perdues commence à m'énerver. Nous allons en ﬁnir une fois pour toutes.</p><p></p><p>Il se retourna pour regarder l'horloge fixée au mur derrière lui. Amaya suivit le mouvement du corps massif, gonﬂé d'autorité. A droite de l’horloge était accroché le portrait juvénile de l’Immortel président, mort assassiné par elle ne savait trop qui, tant les versions présentées étaient contradictoires. Tandis qu’à gauche, le mur était tapissé de slogans qui ne disaient rien à Amaya pour la simple raison qu’elle ne savait pas la langue. Le camarade chef se retourna, consulta sa montre-bracelet, comme pour confirmer I’heure de l’horloge, puis grogna à travers la moustache qui ornait sa délicate bouche \"qui ne mangeait que de la viande\", pour reprendre les paroles du plus célèbre musicien du pays.</p><p>- Comme il est déjà midi, revenez cet après-midi à quatorze heures.</p><p></p><p>- Mais...</p><p>Il claqua la fenêtre du guichet.</p><p></p><p>* bredouille: sans succès </p><p></p>"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM French","Unit:3","Unit:2","Skill:Skill 3.A: Interpret the distinguishing features of a text.","Skill:Skill 3.B: Interpret the meaning of a text.","Skill Category:Skill Category 3: Interpret the content of written or audio text (words).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Task Model:Literary Text"]},"cat":{"t":[307214,307215,307216,307217,307310,307314,307316],"f":{"Unit":["2"],"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Theme":["Personal and Public Identities"],"Task Model":["Literary Text"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"],"Modes of Communication":["Interpretive Reading"],"Requires Culture Knowledge":["No"],"Geographic Region":["Africa (Sub-Saharan)"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT535680":{"id":"FT535680","q":{"id":"FT535680","t":"mcq","s":"<p>D’après le passage, quel groupe apprécie le plus les bienfaits de la science?</p>","o":[{"v":"i0","l":"<p>Les employés</p>"},{"v":"i1","l":"<p>Les ouvriers</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p>Les professeurs</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p>Les agriculteurs</p>"}],"a":"i3","f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_31ea5fe2aa7f38e829b2a5f810fd49f8","c":"<p>Directions: Read the following passage carefully.

Bonheur des voyageurs qui retrouvent pour un moment la douceur d’un intérieur familial. A vrai dire celui-ci n'est pas grand. Deux pièces et une cuisine en enfilade, bordées sur toute la longueur par une étroite baie vitrée. Le père d'Akim a cinquante-neuf ans, il a divorcé voici quelques années, eu trois enfants dans son nouveau ménage, et voici qu'il vient d’être mis à la retraite après bientôt quarante ans d’usine. Il est arrivé en France au début des années 50. Il a connu Aubervilliers avec ses champs et ses jardins, qu’il traversait sur son vélomoteur pour aller travailler chez Motobécane. Il y a longtemps qu’il ne retourne plus en Algérie : de toute façon c’est trop cher. Sa vie est ici. Trop á l’étroit, malheureusement, à cinq dans deux pièces : mais à la mairie on répond qu'il faut s’occuper en priorité des jeunes couples.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Comme la chose la plus naturelle du monde, le père d’Akim a décidé de recevoir les amis inconnus de son fils de la même manière que s’ils étaient quelques cousins débarquant après un long voyage : sa femme a préparé un couscous princier. Autour de la table, ses deux grands fils - Akim et son frère Sadi, cameraman de télévision - et les trois petits. Les deux ainés parlent des soucis qu’ils se font pour la scolarité de leurs cadets: si ceux-ci pouvaient ne pas traverser ce qu’ils ont eux-mêmes connu.

Bonheur des voyageurs qui retrouvent pour un moment la douceur d’un intérieur familial. A vrai dire celui-ci n'est pas grand. Deux pièces et une cuisine en enfilade, bordées sur toute la longueur par une étroite baie vitrée. Le père d'Akim a cinquante-neuf ans, il a divorcé voici quelques années, eu trois enfants dans son nouveau ménage, et voici qu'il vient d’être mis à la retraite après bientôt quarante ans d’usine. Il est arrivé en France au début des années 50. Il a connu Aubervilliers avec ses champs et ses jardins, qu’il traversait sur son vélomoteur pour aller travailler chez Motobécane. Il y a longtemps qu’il ne retourne plus en Algérie : de toute façon c’est trop cher. Sa vie est ici. Trop á l’étroit, malheureusement, à cinq dans deux pièces : mais à la mairie on répond qu'il faut s’occuper en priorité des jeunes couples.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Comme la chose la plus naturelle du monde, le père d’Akim a décidé de recevoir les amis inconnus de son fils de la même manière que s’ils étaient quelques cousins débarquant après un long voyage : sa femme a préparé un couscous princier. Autour de la table, ses deux grands fils - Akim et son frère Sadi, cameraman de télévision - et les trois petits. Les deux ainés parlent des soucis qu’ils se font pour la scolarité de leurs cadets: si ceux-ci pouvaient ne pas traverser ce qu’ils ont eux-mêmes connu. Le problème des cités, dit Akim, c’est qu’elles ne vous lâchent pas facilement : elles sont fermées sur elles-mêmes, elles offrent un territoire, une forme de sécurité. Il y a des gosses qui grandissent dans leur cité d’Auber sans jamais vraiment chercher à connaître d`autres horizons. La bande finit par leur tenir lieu de seconde famille, de société, et tout passe après le rôle, le statut, le prestige qu’ils peuvent obtenir dans son sein : le plus important est de ne pas démériter aux yeux des autres.

L’article original a été publié le 4 février 2010 dans l’Île de la Réunion par le <em>Journal de l’Île de la Réunion</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>La femme et la mer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Être femme de marin-pêcheur, ce n’est pas toujours simple. Rencontrez Yolaine Boutillon et tous les préjugés tombent. Son sourire, son auto-dérision, ses projets autour de la mer et même une association: celle des femmes de marins-pêcheurs de la Réunion.</p>\n\n<p>Une vraie tornade. Elle a un emploi du temps à faire pâlir un ministre. «Je pense vivre avec mon temps!» souligne la présidente depuis plus de cinq années de l’Association des femmes de marins-pêcheurs de La Réunion (AFEMAR). Pour Yolaine Boutillon, tout tourne autour de la mer. C’est un peu son destin... Native de Saint-André, elle a très vite déménagé dans le sud pour asseoir son indépendance car elle trouvait agréable de voir la mer en ville. «Installée à Saint-Pierre, j’ai fait plusieurs petits boulots, travaillé notamment dix années dans une station service. Quand j’ai rencontré mon époux, Jean, il était infirmier libéral. Il est devenu pêcheur-professionnel à Saint-Pierre car c’était sa passion. Je me suis trompée sur la marchandise!», explique cette mère de deux filles en éclatant de rire. À la naissance de sa première fille, Lisa, elle arrête de travailler et rencontre alors d’autres femmes de marins-pêcheurs. «J’avais entendu parler de l’association qui était en sommeil depuis une vingtaine d’années. On a décidé de la remettre en activité.» Son but: rassembler les femmes de marins-pêcheurs afin qu’elles s’entraident quand leur mari est en mer ou s’il a un accident. «Au départ, je voulais réunir toutes les femmes des pêcheurs de toute l’île, mais c’est compliqué. Même si les membres n’habitent qu’à Saint-Pierre, on accepte tout le monde.» Au fur et à mesure, Yolaine apprécie cet esprit de partage, de soutien et de solidarité. Elle est de plus en plus dynamique au sein de l’association pour en devenir même la présidente en 2005.</p>\n\n<p>Entre ses deux filles Lisa et Emmy, son époux, son travail qui consiste à vendre le poisson sur le port de Saint-Pierre, l’association, «Yoyo» comme l’appelle ses amis, trouve le temps de monter un musée dédié à la mer et d’endosser son rôle de conseillère inter-quartier. «Il existe une commission municipale où on a l’opportunité de rapporter ce qui ne va pas.

Nous travaillons en partenariat avec la Fédération Française de Cyclisme, les mairies, et différents organismes humanitaires installés un peu partout dans le monde, et nous sommes fiers d’annoncer que depuis nos trois ans d’existence, nous avons déjà fait don de plus de 2000 bicyclettes.</p>\n\n<p>Le principe est simple et part d’une constatation navrante: combien d’entre nous avons un, deux, voire trois vélos dormant sous une épaisse couche de poussière, remisés depuis des lustres dans un coin obscur du garage, ne sortant que pour une occasionnelle randonnée estivale, pour n’être finalement plus qu’un souvenir de l’histoire familiale?</p>\n\n<p>Si «Un vélo dans la tête» propose à chacun de redécouvrir les routes de France et les joies des ballades nez au vent, «Vélocratie» propose aux autres de donner leurs illustres vélos pour la bonne cause. Les dons ainsi recueillis trouvent une seconde vie dans les endroits les plus communs comme les plus inattendus, de l’université de Créteil aux écoles de Sierra Leone, en passant par l’orphelinat de la Poste. Depuis l’an dernier, chaque personne ayant fait don d’un vélo peut désormais, si elle le souhaite, suivre le trajet parcouru par celui-ci, du centre de dépôt au point de livraison finale. Il suffit pour cela de remplir la fiche disponible dans les centres de dépôts. Vous pouvez voir sur notre site Internet par exemple, le périple du vélo de Madame Charbonnier, parti depuis le «Décathlon» de Limoges jusqu’à la mairie de Vic-La-Gardiole, un parcours de plus de 900 kilomètres! Le vélo a finalement été distribué dans un foyer éducatif où il a permis à un enfant de plus de se joindre au groupe lors de randonnées cyclistes. Nous disposons de plus de 30 centres de dépôt et travaillons sur l’ouverture d’une vingtaine d’autres d’ici à la fin de l’année.</p>\n\n<p>Pour toute question concernant notre association, que vous vouliez faire un don ou bien devenir membre de notre réseau de dépôt, vous pouvez consulter notre site Internet ou bien nous contacter directement au 02-89-36-00-01.</p>\n\n<p>Nous espérons que notre lettre aura attiré votre attention, et que vous voudrez bien la publier dans votre journal dont nous sommes fans.</p>\n\n<p>Sincères salutations,</p>\n\n<p>Jeanne Chaudet, présidente de Vélocratie</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM French","Unit:5","Unit:6","Skill:Skill 3.A: Interpret the distinguishing features of a text.","Skill:Skill 3.B: Interpret the meaning of a text.","Skill Category:Skill Category 3: Interpret the content of written or audio text (words).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Task Model:Letter"]},"cat":{"t":[307214,307215,307216,307217,307310,307314,307317,379628],"f":{"Unit":["5"],"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Theme":["Contemporary Life"],"Task Model":["Letter"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"],"Modes of Communication":["Interpretive Reading"],"Requires Culture Knowledge":["No"],"Geographic Region":["France"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT536160":{"id":"FT536160","q":{"id":"FT536160","t":"mcq","s":"<p>Quel est le but principal de la lettre de Jeanne Chaudet?</p>","o":[{"v":"i0","l":"<p>Accroître la visibilité de «Vélocratie»</p>"},{"v":"i1","l":"<p>Trouver des soutiens financiers</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p>Présenter les membres de «Vélocratie»</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p>Soutenir l’initiative d’«Un vélo dans la tête»</p>"}],"a":"i0","f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_538ec49698e799dca196a4ee6c6aad2f","c":"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The selection below is accompanied by a number of questions.

Je suis la présidente de «Vélocratie», une association composée d’une quinzaine de volontaires, et dédiée à la réinsertion des vélos d’occasion dans un but charitable. Nous travaillons en partenariat avec la Fédération Française de Cyclisme, les mairies, et différents organismes humanitaires installés un peu partout dans le monde, et nous sommes fiers d’annoncer que depuis nos trois ans d’existence, nous avons déjà fait don de plus de 2000 bicyclettes.</p>\n\n<p>Le principe est simple et part d’une constatation navrante: combien d’entre nous avons un, deux, voire trois vélos dormant sous une épaisse couche de poussière, remisés depuis des lustres dans un coin obscur du garage, ne sortant que pour une occasionnelle randonnée estivale, pour n’être finalement plus qu’un souvenir de l’histoire familiale?</p>\n\n<p>Si «Un vélo dans la tête» propose à chacun de redécouvrir les routes de France et les joies des ballades nez au vent, «Vélocratie» propose aux autres de donner leurs illustres vélos pour la bonne cause. Les dons ainsi recueillis trouvent une seconde vie dans les endroits les plus communs comme les plus inattendus, de l’université de Créteil aux écoles de Sierra Leone, en passant par l’orphelinat de la Poste. Depuis l’an dernier, chaque personne ayant fait don d’un vélo peut désormais, si elle le souhaite, suivre le trajet parcouru par celui-ci, du centre de dépôt au point de livraison finale. Il suffit pour cela de remplir la fiche disponible dans les centres de dépôts. Vous pouvez voir sur notre site Internet par exemple, le périple du vélo de Madame Charbonnier, parti depuis le «Décathlon» de Limoges jusqu’à la mairie de Vic-La-Gardiole, un parcours de plus de 900 kilomètres! Le vélo a finalement été distribué dans un foyer éducatif où il a permis à un enfant de plus de se joindre au groupe lors de randonnées cyclistes. Nous disposons de plus de 30 centres de dépôt et travaillons sur l’ouverture d’une vingtaine d’autres d’ici à la fin de l’année.</p>\n\n<p>Pour toute question concernant notre association, que vous vouliez faire un don ou bien devenir membre de notre réseau de dépôt, vous pouvez consulter notre site Internet ou bien nous contacter directement au 02-89-36-00-01.</p>\n\n<p>Nous espérons que notre lettre aura attiré votre attention, et que vous voudrez bien la publier dans votre journal dont nous sommes fans.</p>\n\n<p>Sincères salutations,</p>\n\n<p>Jeanne Chaudet, présidente de Vélocratie</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM French","Unit:5","Unit:6","Skill:Skill 3.A: Interpret the distinguishing features of a text.","Skill:Skill 3.B: Interpret the meaning of a text.","Skill Category:Skill Category 3: Interpret the content of written or audio text (words).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Task Model:Letter"]},"cat":{"t":[307214,307215,307216,307217,307310,307314,307317,379628],"f":{"Unit":["5"],"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Theme":["Contemporary Life"],"Task Model":["Letter"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"],"Modes of Communication":["Interpretive Reading"],"Requires Culture Knowledge":["No"],"Geographic Region":["France"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT536211":{"id":"FT536211","q":{"id":"FT536211","t":"longtextV2","s":"<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You will write a reply to an e-mail message.

L’extrait suivant est tiré d’une lettre originale publiée le 7 décembre 2009 en France par un collectif d’associations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Langue française: état d’urgence</strong></p>\n\n<p>L’heure est donc venue d’appeler tous les citoyens à la résistance linguistique.</p>\n\n<p>Nos associations en appellent au peuple français et à tous les francophones du monde, à tous ceux qui savent ce que la liberté, l’égalité, la fraternité, mais aussi la littérature, la philosophie, le droit et les sciences doivent à la langue des Molière, Césaire, Verhaeren et Senghor.</p>\n\n<p>Depuis longtemps, on n’en est plus aux seuls emprunts massifs à l’anglo-américain; nombre de grandes entreprises s’emploient à basculer au tout-anglais une bonne part de leurs pratiques langagières: <em>Time to move!</em> est le titre du programme de mutations que France-Telecom impose à ses salariés, ajoutant l’humiliation linguistique à l’effrayante dégradation de leurs conditions de travail. Dans la distribution, Carrefour, Auchan...basculent leurs produits et enseignes à l’anglais de bazar, imités par des services publics comme la SNCF, La Poste ou Air France. Sommet du «dialogue social»: c’est en anglais que les ouvriers de Continental-Clairoix, réunis dans leur cour d’usine, ont appris leur licenciement collectif! Les choses sont déjà si avancées, tels les fromages forts, que des syndicats de diverses obédiences ont dû monter au créneau pour «défendre le droit de travailler en français en France».</p>\n\n<p>Voyez aussi les travaux de la recherche scientifique française: des siècles après l’acte révolutionnaire de Descartes publiant en français le <em>Discours de la méthode</em>, ils ne sont souvent plus pensés et écrits par nos chercheurs qu’en anglo-américain, même pas toujours traduits en français. Passons sur la chanson, sur les pubs en anglais qui, aux heures de grande écoute, ciblent surtout les jeunes, les enfants. On ne voit que trop qui sert cette politique d’anéantissement linguistique sous son emballage pseudo-moderne: elle sert cette «élite» et ces privilégiés qui, pas seulement à droite, n’hésitent pas à désintégrer leur langue maternelle pour mieux intégrer l’élite mondialisée et ressembler à leurs maîtres! Les «gens de peu», pour leur part, sont voués à une discrimination linguistique plus forte que jamais. Quant à nos cadres moyens qui croient s’en tirer en ingurgitant le <em>Wall Street English</em> promu dans le métro parisien, le basculement au tout-anglais consacre leur aliénation dans un travail de plus en plus dévalorisé.</p>\n\n<p>Face aux coups portés, le silence des autorités inquiète. Pis: des ministres approuvent ou annoncent diverses mesures de substitution de l’anglais au français, des petites classes jusqu’à l’enseignement supérieur. Ainsi la nouvelle antenne de Reims de Sciences-Po dispensera-t-elle tous ses cours en anglais. Ainsi le chef de l’État annonce-t-il que des enseignements fondamentaux du second degré pourraient être dispensés «en langues étrangères» (traduisons: en anglais).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source numéro 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introduction</p>\n\n<p>Dans cette sélection il s’agit du statut du français comme langue de traduction à la Commission européenne.

For each question, select the best response according to your understanding of the passage, and mark your answer.</p><p></p><p>Depuis bientôt six ans, Jean-Barthélémy Yombi Mondembom exerce le métier de pâtissier, chocolatier, confiseur et glacier. D'abord apprenti chez un maître à Paris dans le troisième arrondissement, il suit des cours à Pantin. Par l'intermédiaire d'un de ses professeurs, c'est là qu'il découvre l'existence du programme SESAM.* Sélectionné par son école, et après trois mois d'initiation à la langue allemande, il part à Francfort pour huit mois de formation. Les contacts établis avec son employeur, qui possède sept salons de thé, ont tout de suite été très cordiaux. Responsable de la pâtisserie française, comme il se doit, Jean-Barthélémy est en fait resté dix-huit mois en Allemagne. De Ia fabrication des pains et gâteaux au contact avec la clientèle, il a franchi toutes les étapes de son métier.</p><p>Ce qu'il dit avoir appris là-bas? \"Le professionnalisme, la rigueur dans l'exercice de [son] métier.\" Il a aussi perfectionné \"[ses] aptitudes à gérer [son] temps et le travail en équipe.\" D'origine camerounaise, Jean-Barthélémy a peut-être été moins dépaysé que d'autres de ses camarades, car lui savait ce que c'est qu' \"être considéré comme étranger dans un pays.\" Mais sa curiosité, son attirance pour tout ce qui  se passe ailleurs, ont facilité son intégration. Son passage par le  SESAM et son séjour en Allemagne ont ensuite constitué une étape décisive pour toutes Jes expériences.</p><p>Depuis près de trois ans qu'il est rentré en France, Jean-Barthélémy a multiplié les projets. Il a d'abord travaillé pendant quatre mois dans une société de pâtissier-traiteur. Puis, après avoir mis de l'argent de côté, il est parti tenir un salon de thé dans les Pyrénées avec un camarade qui s'occupait de la gestion commerciale. Au bout de huit mois, ils ont été contraints de s'arrêter. Pas facile de créer une entreprise et de travailler à son compte quand on se heurte à des problémes administratifs!</p><p>Une entreprise anglo-saxonne lui propose alors un poste en Grande-Bretagne. Bien que très motivé, il ne peut l'accepter, l'administration britannique lui refusant de travailler sur son sol. SESAM n'ouvre, hélas! pas toutes les portes ... Même dans l'Union européenne. D'un naturel plutôt entreprenant, Jean-Barthélémy est peu enclin à se laisser décourager et retombe vite sur ses pieds: il accepte la proposition d'une société semi-industrielle, spécialisée dans les \"extras \". Cela fait six mois qu'il travaille dans une pâtisserie-boulangerie de huit personnes près de Paris. Il y est responsable de la cuisson et de la finition de toute la pâtisserie. Avant de réaliser les autres projets qu'il a en tête.</p><p>Travaillant tour à tour a son compte, dans des boulangeries-pâtisseries traditionnelles et chez des pâtissiers-traiteurs de taille plus importante, en France comme à l'étranger, Jean-Barthélémy s'est nourri de ces expériences diverses, alors qu'il n'a pas encore vingt-cinq ans. Sensible au côté artistique \"ou l'on prend son temps pour bien faire\" de l'artisan-boulanger, il apprécie tout autant l'efficacité de structures plus industrielles où l'on sait produire des aliments de bonne qualité. Arriver à  cumuler les deux est son ambition.</p><p></p><p>*SESAM: Stages européens en alternance dans les métiers (apprentissage dans une entreprise étrangère-s'adresse aux jeunes âgés de 18 à 25 ans)</p>"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM French","Unit:5","Unit:2","Skill:Skill 3.A: Interpret the distinguishing features of a text.","Skill:Skill 3.B: Interpret the meaning of a text.","Skill Category:Skill Category 3: Interpret the content of written or audio text (words).","Assessment Type:Summative","Question Type:MCQ","Task Model:Article and Chart"]},"cat":{"t":[307214,307215,307216,307217,307310,307314,307315],"f":{"Unit":["2"],"Exam Alignment":["Partial"],"Theme":["Personal and Public Identities"],"Task Model":["Article and Chart"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"],"Modes of Communication":["Interpretive Reading"],"Requires Culture Knowledge":["Yes"],"Geographic Region":["France"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"FT556456":{"id":"FT556456","q":{"id":"FT556456","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p>You will write a reply to an e-mail message.

L’article original a été publié le 6 septembre 2014 en France par le site Web blog.seniorenforme.com.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Faut-il interdire la conduite aux seniors ?</strong><br />\n<br />\nUn village de l’Ain a lancé une pétition afin de retirer le permis de conduire à un retraité de 77 ans à l’origine de 3 accidents mortels ! Un procureur veut poursuivre les familles des chauffards seniors ! « Vieillir ou conduire, il faut choisir », cette citation est particulièrement d’actualité. En effet, certains préconisent depuis longtemps un test d’aptitude à la conduite à partir d’un certain âge.<br />\n<br />\nPourquoi stigmatiser une partie de la population ? Les seniors sont-ils plus maladroits que les autres classes d’âge au volant ? Certains veulent mettre un V à l’arrière des voitures pour signifier vieux conducteur comme le A ! Inadmissible !</p>\n\n<p>Il faut tordre l’idée reçue que les seniors sont des dangers sur les routes car en proportion ils ont moins d’accidents que les autres ! Ce qu’il faut aussi retenir, c’est que les accidents de voiture causés par les seniors ne sont dûs ni à l’alcool, ni à la vitesse, mais souvent à des fautes d’inattention comme un refus de priorité. Les personnes de plus de 65 ans ont des accidents principalement dans les intersections.</p>\n\n<p>Vous vous souvenez que déjà en 2002, le gouvernement voulait imposer un contrôle médical régulier à partir de 70 ans chez son médecin traitant.</p>\n\n<p>Cependant cette idée a été vite abandonnée car elle coûtait trop cher ! Cependant, dans de nombreux pays d’Europe les contrôles d’aptitude sont de mise comme en Espagne à partir de 60 ans ou en Suisse à partir de 70 ans. Mais vous imaginez la responsabilité de votre médecin traitant vous empêchant de prendre la voiture ? Pour certains, ne plus conduire est un signe de perte d’autonomie et de fin de liberté. Ne stigmatise-t-on pas les gens uniquement en fonction de leur âge ?</p>\n\n<p>La proposition de loi soumettant à un examen de santé les plus de 70 ans qui conduisent encore n’est-elle pas blessante quand on sait, selon les chiffres officiels, que les âgés n’ont pas plus d’accidents que les autres ? Bien sûr, les médias vont mettre en avant une personne de 80 ans qui a pris l’autoroute à l’envers, ou une autre qui s’est endormie au volant. Certes, mais ces conduites dangereuses sont-elles seulement l’apanage des seniors ?</p>\n\n<p>Cependant, il ne faut pas nier que conduire après un certain âge nécessite quelques adaptations simples et principes élémentaires de sécurité :<br />\n• Faites contrôler régulièrement votre vue et votre audition,<br />\n• D’autre part, il faut savoir que la Prévention Routière propose des stages de « remise à niveau » aux seniors,<br />\n• Faites attention dans les trajets du quotidien car les accidents surviennent le plus souvent à proximité du domicile,<br />\n• Et puis surtout écoutez votre entourage s’il s’inquiète de vous voir au volant à votre âge. C’est peut-être dur à entendre mais ils vous aiment et vous veulent du bien.</p>\n\n<p><sub>Used by permission</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Source numéro 2</strong><br />\nIntroduction<br />\nDans cette sélection il s’agit des titulaires d’un permis selon l’âge.

L’article original a été publié le 25 juin 2004 en France par le journaliste Alpha Barry.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Les premiers pas vers les OGM</strong></p>\n\n<p>Les États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest viennent de s’engager en faveur d’une introduction de la biotechnologie, c’est-à-dire les OGM, dans l’agriculture africaine à l’issue d’une conférence organisée du 21 au 23 juin à Ouagadougou sur l’initiative des gouvernements burkinabè et américain Alors que les organisations de la société civile appellent à la prudence, pour les décideurs des pays concernés, c’est un «premier et important» pas qui est franchi dans la modernisation de l’agriculture africaine.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nPour les Africains, le débat sur les OGM est simple: dans un continent qui a faim, c’est le seul moyen d’augmenter de façon substantielle la productivité agricole et donc d’assurer la sécurité alimentaire aux populations. Selon les estimations des experts, l’Afrique dépassera à l’horizon 2025 1,2 milliards d’habitants. Le continent devra accroître sa production actuelle de 10 à 12 fois pour satisfaire les besoins de cette population. «Cela n’est pas possible sans une maîtrise et une adaptation des biotechnologies pour accroître rapidement la production alimentaire», estime Blaise Compaoré le président burkinabè, hôte de cette première conférence en Afrique.</p>\n\n<p>La réunion de Ouagadougou fait suite à une première organisée l’année dernière à Sacramento (États-Unis) par le gouvernement américain dans le but de convaincre les États africains d’introduire les OGM 30 dans leur agriculture. Le premier d’entre eux à mordre à l’hameçon tendu par les Américains est le Burkina Faso. Deuxième producteur de coton graine en Afrique de l’Ouest après le Mali avec 500 000 tonnes, le Burkina s’est lancé en 2003 avec la firme américaine Monsanto dans l’expérimentation «en milieu confiné» du coton transgénique. «On a bien réussi à augmenter notre production dans les conditions actuelles, mais il sera difficile de dépasser un million de tonnes. Or, avec la baisse des cours, nous n’avons pas d’autre choix que de produire en quantité. Et la biotechnologie peut nous permettre d’atteindre 2 à 3 millions de tonnes», explique Salif est presque Diallo, ministre burkinabè de l’agriculture.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nAutre exemple cité par les pro-OGM, celui de la<br />\nproduction laitière. Alors que sous d’autres cieux, les vaches issues de différents croisements produisent 40 à 50 litres de lait par jour, en Afrique on est à 1 litre «Est-ce que nous devons continuer à faire venir par avion des races du Brésil comme cela a été le cas il y a quelques années au Burkina?», s’interroge le professeur Hamidou Boly, directeur de l’Institut burkinabè de recherche agricole et enseignant de génétique animale dans différentes universités européennes. «Observer un moratoire ne veut pas dire qu’il faut se croiser les bras et attendre qu’un jour les Européens nous disent que les OGM sont sans danger avant de commencer les expérimentations», réagit le professeur Boly aux critiques des organisations burkinabè de la société civile.</p>\n\n<p><sub>Copyright © 2004 by RFI.

L’article original a été publié le 20 avril 2012 en France par le professeur français Didier Maus de l’université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Non, au droit de vote à 16 ans: «Impossible de faire preuve de discernement politique si jeune»</strong></p>\n\n<p><br>\nIl existe une tendance historique à abaisser l’âge de la majorité, qu’il s’agisse de la majorité civile, de la majorité sociale. C’est ainsi que la majorité civique de 21 ans a été ramenée à 18 ans à l’initiative de Valéry Giscard d’Estaing en 1974. Il s’en est suivi que l’âge d’éligibilité a lui-même été fixé à 18 ans, supprimant ainsi la sorte de stage qui existait antérieurement entre l’âge d’accès au droit de vote et celui auquel on peut se présenter. La dernière étape a été celle du Sénat, même s’il est encore nécessaire d’être âgé de 24 ans pour pouvoir se présenter à une élection sénatoriale.</p>\n\n<p>Il est évidemment nécessaire de déterminer un plancher en deçà duquel l’octroi du droit de vote n’aurait guère de signification.</p>\n\n<p>Est-il envisageable de le déterminer de manière rationnelle? Sans doute pas. Chaque individu accède à la conscience politique, et par conséquent à la capacité de participer à la décision collective à un âge différent. Cela dépend de nombreux facteurs, y compris les circonstances historiques. Les jeunes adolescents engagés dans la Résistance possédaient une expérience politique réelle. Le code électoral a d’ailleurs comporté pendant longtemps une disposition qui permettait d’accorder le droit de vote avant 21 ans à ceux qui avaient été décorés très jeune pour fait de guerre. Aujourd’hui il faut garder raison et ne pas céder à la tentation d’aligner le droit de vote sur le droit de participer aux élections professionnelles, à partir de l’âge légal d’accès au travail, c’est-à-dire 16 ans.</p>\n\n<p>Le jeune qui travaille a, par définition, quitté le système scolaire de l’enseignement secondaire et est entré dans le monde des adultes. La plupart des garçons et filles de 16 ans sont encore scolarisés. C’est un argument de poids pour considérer qu’ils n’ont pas encore rejoint la communauté politique nationale. Certes le constat pourrait être transposé pour les jeunes de 18 ans, mais en règle générale ils sont sortis du système scolaire ou sont en passe de le faire. Si l’on estime que les collèges et les lycées doivent mieux préparer à la vie civique, il faut maintenir la majorité à 18 ans.</p>\n\n<p>Honnêtement, 18 ans est un âge très généralement admis dans les démocraties européennes. Ne cédons pas à la manie de vouloir que la France soit systématiquement une exception.</p>\n\n<p><sub>http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/impossible-disposer-veritable-discernement-politique-16-ans-eva-joly-philippe-poutou-didier-maus-336402.html.

Au rang des produits incriminés: les viandes rouges mais aussi les viandes transformées ( charcuteries, saucisses, boudin, pâté, corned-beef ...). En revanche, la volaille et le poisson ne semblent pas augmenter le risque. L’explication tiendrait au fer contenu dans les viandes rouges. Ce qui explique que les viandes blanches et les poissons beaucoup moins riches en fer n’augmentent pas les risques.</p>\n\n<p>Mais si une consommation excessive de viande est nocive, ne pas en manger du tout permet-il de protéger sa santé? Il semble bien que non. Si les recherches menées sur des populations suffisamment importantes sont rares, on retiendra néanmoins que les végétariens sont globalement plus minces que les autres, et qu’ils ont moins de problèmes de cholestérol. Mais pour les cancers, les résultats sont mitigés. Les études sur le cancer du sein, de l’estomac, des poumons ne montrent d’ailleurs aucune différence. Certes difficile de conclure à partir de ces petites études. D’autant que végétarien n’est pas toujours synonyme d’alimentation équilibrée ...</p>\n\n<p>Alors, que faire en pratique? Comme le souligne Elio Riboli, responsable de l’Agence Internationale pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (IARC) , pas question d’arrêter de manger la viande. Car le fait de supprimer du jour au lendemain un aliment faisant partie intégrante de notre alimentation risque de provoquer d’importants déséquilibres. Il ne faut pas oublier que la viande rouge est une source de protéines, de fer et de vitamines du groupe B. La règle: diminuer sa consommation de viande rouge (une à deux fois par semaine maximum) et augmenter la part de volailles et de poisson.</p>\n\n<p><sub>Used by permission</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Source numéro 2</strong><br />\n<br />\nIntroduction<br />\nDans cette sélection il s’agit du taux de consommation de viande en France dans les années récentes.

L’article original a été publié le 15 novembre 2009 en France par Radio France Internationale.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>La France plaide pour le &lt;&lt;droit a l'oubli&gt;&gt; sur Internet</strong></p>\n\n<p>La secrétaire d’État française à l’économie numérique, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, va plaider au 4e Forum sur la gouvernance de l’Internet (IGF) pour un «droit à l’oubli» numérique, pour mieux protéger la vie privée. Ce Forum de l’IGF, consacré à la sécurité sur la Toile et l’impact des réseaux&nbsp;de socialisation, s’est ouvert dimanche 15 novembre à Charm el Cheikh, en Égypte.</p>\n\n<p>La secrétaire d’État à l’économie numérique, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, a lancé le 12 novembre une consultation nationale sur le droit à l’oubli sur Internet. Un site Internet sera ouvert le 25 novembre pour que les internautes fassent connaître leurs propositions. L’objectif serait de permettre aux individus de mieux contrôler les traces et données personnelles qu’ils laissent sur Internet, avec comme visée, la rédaction d’une charte de bonne conduite.</p>\n\n<p>Le «droit à l’oubli» sur Internet est fondamental pour deux raisons. D’abord, parce qu’aujourd’hui, cet outil nous expose à des risques, en mettant à portée d’institutions ou d’entreprises des données personnelles que nous avons oubliées ou que nous ne souhaitons pas conserver. Mais aussi parce que l’oubli, autant que la mémoire, est essentiel à l’humain. C’est la thèse de Viktor Mayer Schönberger, auteur d’un livre sur la question:</p>\n\n<p>«La capacité d’oublier est ce qui fait de nous des êtres humains. Si vous ne savez pas oublier, vous aurez toujours des confrontations, des rappels de détails du passé. On ne serait pas capables d’agir, de décider et de fonctionner dans le présent.»</p>\n\n<p>Pour effacer les données personnelles, il ne suffit pas, selon lui, d’un outil technologique. Il propose une solution où l’individu participe activement au tri des données qui le concerne:</p>\n\n<p>«Quand les gens ont envie de sauvegarder ou de partager des informations avec d’autres, ils y attacheraient une date d’expiration. Et quand cette date d’expiration serait atteinte, l’information serait effacée. Nous avons besoin en tant que citoyens d’être maîtres de cette décision, de choisir nous-mêmes de ce qui de nos informations personnelles sera retenu ou effacé. Ce ne doit pas être le choix des grosses corporations, ou des gouvernements de nos pays.»</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<sub>“La France plaide,” copyright © by Radio France Internationale.

L’article original a été publié le 27 septembre 2010 au Maroc par Jaouad Mdidech, journaliste à <em>La Vie éco.</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A web browser's blank search bar is shown\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/78fdce22d11b8866fe6de7eea52a0a7b/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ils ont 35 ans et plus et vivent encore chez leurs parents</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pas facile de quitter le nid familial quand on y est choyé et quand l’argent qu’on gagne ne profite qu’à celui qui l’engrange. A qui la faute ? Aux enfants qui en profitent ? Aux parents qui au fond d’eux-mêmes ont du mal à se séparer de leur progéniture ? Ou à la société qui n’arrive pas à assurer le travail à ces millions de jeunes adultes pour qu’ils puissent avoir leur propre vie loin de leurs parents ? La responsabilité est partagée, mais celle des parents qui n’ont pas su inculquer à leurs enfants le sens de l’indépendance est plus grande. Leur rôle est en effet de « faire en sorte que leurs enfants gagnent cette capacité à voler de leurs propres ailes. Toute personne adulte dispose en théorie de ce libre arbitre », estime Mohssine Benzakour, psychosociologue. Le grand désavantage de nos jeunes actuels, à la différence des générations précédentes, analyse Mohamed El Aouad, professeur de sociologie à la faculté de droit de Salé, est qu’« ils n’entrent pas de plain-pied dans la vie active juste après l’adolescence. La période des études devient très longue, la formation n’est pas adaptée au marché de l’emploi. Résultat : pas de travail, pas de logement et pas de mariage, les trois conditions essentielles pour accéder réellement à l’âge adulte ».</p>\n\n<p>Ce sont donc des considérations financières, en premier lieu, qui entravent l’exercice de ce « libre arbitre » dont parle M. Benzakour. L’écrasante majorité des jeunes adultes qui continuent de vivre sous le toit de leurs parents le font par manque de moyens pour se payer leur propre logement. On pourrait même avancer que c’est la règle générale pour les adultes célibataires, pour les femmes en particulier, de continuer à partager le toit parental. Et leur nombre ne cesse d’augmenter. L’aspect financier est donc primordial, « le taux de chômage pour cette tranche d’âge est assez fort, le loyer est à des prix exorbitants, le pouvoir d’achat par rapport au coût de la vie est très inférieur », confirme M. Benzakour.</p>\n\n<p>L’allongement des études, la précarité économique et le chômage y sont pour beaucoup. Mais cela n’explique pas tout. Habiter avec ses parents à 30 et 40 ans, tant qu’on n’est pas marié, n’est pas stigmatisé outre mesure dans la société marocaine. Car « il y a l’idée persistante et qui trouve ses sources dans notre culture », enchaîne M. Benzakour. « Tant qu’on est célibataire, on n’a pas le droit de vivre séparé de ses parents ».</p>\n\n<p>La raison économique et la raison culturelle ne sont pas seules à expliquer le prolongement de cette cohabitation des enfants adultes avec leurs parents. Il y en a qui travaillent, mais qui restent chez leurs parents n’osant pas franchir le pas. A cause d’un manque de confiance, mais aussi à cause de parents trop possessifs, estime M. Benzakour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source numéro 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Introduction</p>\n\n<p>Dans cette sélection il s’agit de jeunes adultes habitant avec leurs parents au Canada.

C’est avec plaisir que je réponds à vos questions sur<br />\nnotre stage d’art dramatique pour enfants sourds ou malentendants qui a lieu chaque année dans les<br />\n<strong>(5)&nbsp;</strong>mois de juillet-août.</p>\n\n<p>Fondée en 1983, l’association Théâtre des mains qui parlent s’est donnée pour tâche d’accueillir et<br />\nd’instruire dans les arts du théâtre des jeunes âgés de dix à quinze ans ayant des troubles de<br />\nl’audition. Nos locaux se trouvent dans les environs d’Aix-en-Provence, une des plus belles régions<br />\nde France. Nous recevons une trentaine d’enfants pour un séjour de trois semaines. À&nbsp;ces jeunes qui<br />\n<strong>(10)&nbsp;</strong>utilisent principalement la langue des signes, des professionnels offrent des cours et des ateliers dans<br />\nles domaines du théâtre, de l’art et de la photographie. À&nbsp;la fin du stage on présentera la pièce à<br />\nlaquelle tout le monde aura contribué. On aura aussi une exposition des oeuvres créées au cours des<br />\ntrois semaines.</p>\n\n<p>Les moniteurs qui nous aident dans ce travail doivent avoir des compétences en langue des signes<br />\n<strong>(15)&nbsp;</strong>aussi bien qu’une formation approfondie dans un domaine artistique.

L’inauguration de cette bibliothèque,<br />\nbaptisée « Bibliothèque Melchior Leridon », sera<br />\nsuivie de la rénovation de deux autres centres<br />\n<strong>(10)&nbsp;</strong>documentaires dans le cadre du projet « Belles<br />\nBibliothèques du Bénin ».<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; La cérémonie s’est déroulée en présence des<br />\nministres béninois de la Jeunesse et de la culture,<br />\nMessieurs Daplogan et Abimbola, de l’Ambassadeur<br />\n<strong>(15)&nbsp;</strong>de France au Bénin, Jean-Paul Monchau, et des<br />\nco-présidents d’AAD, Gervanne et Matthias Leridon.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Cette bibliothèque, implantée dans le quartier<br />\npopulaire d’Agla, est entièrement dédiée à l’accès des<br />\njeunes Béninois à la lecture.<br />\n<strong>(20)&nbsp;</strong>L’accès à l’éducation pour tous, et plus<br />\nparticulièrement l’alphabétisation, ont clairement été<br />\nérigés en priorité par les Nations Unies à travers les<br />\n<em>Objectifs du millénaire pour le développement 2015</em>.<br />\nConvaincu que la lecture est un pivot essentiel du<br />\n<strong>(25)</strong> développement, Artistes africains pour le&nbsp;<br />\ndéveloppement (AAD) met ainsi à disposition des<br />\nenfants et adolescents de Cotonou plus de 1 200<br />\nouvrages en français, en accès libre, constituant un<br />\ntrès important fonds documentaire destiné à la<br />\n<strong>(30)&nbsp;</strong>jeunesse.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Par la lecture, véritable porte d’entrée du<br />\ndéveloppement, AAD s’engage ainsi à faire des<br />\nlecteurs d’aujourd’hui les citoyens de demain.<br />\nComme le soulignent les co-présidents d’AAD, « il<br />\n<strong>(35)&nbsp;</strong>n’existe pas de moyen d’évasion et d’émancipation<br />\nplus fort que le livre. Parce que nous sommes<br />\nconvaincus qu’un développement n’est efficace et<br />\ndurable que s’il est producteur de sens, nous sommes<br />\naujourd’hui fiers de pouvoir contribuer à l’accès de<br />\n<strong>(40)</strong> tous à la lecture ».<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Cette initiative a été encouragée par la réussite du<br />\nprojet « Les Bulles de Bukavu », la distribution<br />\ngratuite du plus grand tirage jamais réalisé d’une BD<br />\nen Afrique (100 000 exemplaires).<br />\n<strong>(45)&nbsp;</strong>Parce que pour AAD, un développement humain<br />\ndurable passe nécessairement par l’engagement<br />\nculturel, chacun de ses programmes mobilise un<br />\nartiste contemporain africain qui, en réalisant une<br />\ncréation inédite liée au projet, démultiplie ainsi son<br />\n<strong>(50)</strong> rayonnement et lui confère un ancrage dans la durée<br />\ngrâce à des « alliances de progrès ». C’est dans cette<br />\nlogique qu’AAD a confié à l’artiste béninois Zinkpè<br />\nla réalisation de la pièce centrale de cette<br />\nbibliothèque, un mobile suspendu, premier contact<br />\n<strong>(55)</strong> entre ces jeunes lecteurs et l’art contemporain, qui<br />\névolueront à ses côtés.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Cette première bibliothèque est baptisée « Melchior<br />\nLeridon », en référence au fils aîné des fondateurs<br />\nd’AAD, pour insister sur la nécessité de créer des<br />\n<strong>(60)</strong> passerelles culturelles entre enfants béninois et<br />\nfrançais.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">African Artists for Development. www.aad-fund.org.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source numéro 2</strong><br />\nVous aurez 2 minutes pour lire l’introduction et parcourir les questions.<br />\nIntroduction<br />\nDans cette sélection il s’agit des bibliothèques au Bénin.

Rien de tel pour écouler un produit à bon prix que de le revendre «comme neuf», c’est-à-dire de<br />\n<strong>(25)&nbsp;</strong>préserver son emballage d’origine, et idéalement de ne pas du tout le déballer.</p>\n\n<p>2. Beaucoup d’internautes proposent les mêmes biens culturels, généralement des best-sellers,<br />\ntypiquement les ouvrages primés cette année. Leur décote étant rapide, mieux vaut se dépêcher.</p>\n\n<p>3. En fixant un prix de vente légèrement inférieur au moins cher des vendeurs en concurrence, vous<br />\nne pouvez pas vous tromper.</p>\n\n<p><b>(30)&nbsp;</b>4.

Mais elle n’est pas sans limites. Au Québec, on n’a pas le droit de critiquer son employeur ni ses activités. C’est contre l’obligation de loyauté prévue au Code civil. Si on a un profil Facebook, même privé, c’est considéré comme public, selon le Code civil.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Si les réseaux sociaux rapprochent les gens et permettent à tous le droit de parole publique, ils poussent les entreprises à revoir leur politique d’usage technologique. «&nbsp;Il y a deux ans, on a ajouté les mots ‘médias sociaux’ dans le code de conduite de l’entreprise&nbsp;», mentionne Isabelle Arthur, chef du service, relations avec les médias d'Air Canada. «&nbsp;On a communiqué avec nos 27 000 employés, tant les pilotes que le personnel de bureau et de maintenance, pour les informer que les réseaux sociaux sont maintenant inclus dans les médias traditionnels, d’une certaine façon.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">«&nbsp;Dans la dernière année, bon nombre d’entreprises ont été conscientisées&nbsp;», souligne Bruno Guglielminetti, directeur, communication numérique, du cabinet de relations publiques National. «&nbsp;Un peu comme à l’époque de l'arrivée des ordinateurs dans les lieux de travail, puis d’Internet, des portables et du téléphone cellulaire, les administrateurs ont dû encadrer leur utilisation. La différence avec les réseaux sociaux, c’est qu’on encadre le lien qui existe entre l’individu et l’entreprise.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">National dit être plus sollicité que jamais pour former employeurs et employés à cette nouvelle réalité. «&nbsp;Les formations ont doublé en deux ans&nbsp;», note Bruno Guglielminetti. «&nbsp;Tant chez les cabinets d’avocats que chez les banques et les compagnies d’assurances.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais malgré toutes les précautions prises, les entreprises doivent jauger, au cas par cas, ce qui relève du domaine privé et ce qui relève du domaine public. «&nbsp;Il y a des zones grises&nbsp;», concède Éloïse Gratton.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Isabelle Massé / La Presse</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des employés qui se connectent à Internet au travail.

Pour les dimanches et jours fériés le prix est majoré à 60 euros. Pour certaines excursions, il faut en plus prévoir un transport en minibus et ajouter à ces frais le prix d’un forfait kilométrique.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Nous pourrions vous proposer une visite à pied d’une durée de 4 heures à travers les rues de la ville afin que vous puissiez découvrir la richesse de son patrimoine architectural et culturel. Vous seriez en mesure de visiter la Grand-Place, l’Hôtel de Ville et ses jardins ainsi que le célèbre beffroi baroque qui surplombe la ville. Sous réserve d’accessibilité, nous proposons de même la visite de la fameuse Collégiale Sainte-Waudru renommée pour ses verrières du 16<sup>e </sup>siècle.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Vous n’êtes pas sans savoir que la ville de Mons a été choisie comme « Capitale européenne de la culture » en 2015.

Si on a un profil Facebook, même privé, c’est considéré comme public, selon le Code civil.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Si les réseaux sociaux rapprochent les gens et permettent à tous le droit de parole publique, ils poussent les entreprises à revoir leur politique d’usage technologique. «&nbsp;Il y a deux ans, on a ajouté les mots ‘médias sociaux’ dans le code de conduite de l’entreprise&nbsp;», mentionne Isabelle Arthur, chef du service, relations avec les médias d'Air Canada. «&nbsp;On a communiqué avec nos 27 000 employés, tant les pilotes que le personnel de bureau et de maintenance, pour les informer que les réseaux sociaux sont maintenant inclus dans les médias traditionnels, d’une certaine façon.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">«&nbsp;Dans la dernière année, bon nombre d’entreprises ont été conscientisées&nbsp;», souligne Bruno Guglielminetti, directeur, communication numérique, du cabinet de relations publiques National. «&nbsp;Un peu comme à l’époque de l'arrivée des ordinateurs dans les lieux de travail, puis d’Internet, des portables et du téléphone cellulaire, les administrateurs ont dû encadrer leur utilisation. La différence avec les réseaux sociaux, c’est qu’on encadre le lien qui existe entre l’individu et l’entreprise.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">National dit être plus sollicité que jamais pour former employeurs et employés à cette nouvelle réalité. «&nbsp;Les formations ont doublé en deux ans&nbsp;», note Bruno Guglielminetti. «&nbsp;Tant chez les cabinets d’avocats que chez les banques et les compagnies d’assurances.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais malgré toutes les précautions prises, les entreprises doivent jauger, au cas par cas, ce qui relève du domaine privé et ce qui relève du domaine public. «&nbsp;Il y a des zones grises&nbsp;», concède Éloïse Gratton.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Isabelle Massé / La Presse</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des employés qui se connectent à Internet au travail.

Le gouvernement encourage les gens avec la remise de crédits d’impôt et des économies pourront se faire avec l’essence, mais la différence de prix reste encore élevée et compenser le coût du véhicule prendra plusieurs années.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Bien que les voitures hybrides soient très économes en ville, c’est toutefois moins le cas pour l’autoroute. Souvent, c’est même difficile de percevoir l’économie d’essence sur l’autoroute parce que seulement le moteur thermique fait avancer le véhicule. Mais en ville, le moteur électrique est beaucoup plus sollicité et la différence peut être très grande en comparaison avec un véhicule à essence traditionnel. Il faut aussi mentionner que, puisque la voiture est silencieuse les piétons n’entendent pas sa venue et un certain danger les guette. Toutefois, les compagnies intègrent de plus en plus une technologie qui émet un léger son afin de prévenir les piétons de son arrivée.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Certaines batteries sont fabriquées à partir d’éléments néfastes pour l’environnement. C’est de plus en plus rare, mais il serait intéressant de poser la question lors de l’achat, à savoir si elle est recyclable. Chez les constructeurs automobiles, les batteries de dernière génération fabriquées à partir de lithium-ion sont de plus en plus populaires grâce à leurs propriétés. Elles permettent entre autres une grande charge électrique, elles sont capables de stocker plus d’énergie que le nickel et le cadmium. Également, ces batteries n’ont pas une vie éternelle et devront un jour ou l’autre être changées. Le problème c’est que le coût de remplacement des batteries est assez élevé. Plusieurs sont garanties pour plusieurs années, mais c’est à vérifier. Pour la voiture électrique, une des grandes peurs des gens est évidemment de manquer d’énergie, donc de rester en panne.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Pour l’entretien et la réparation, ces systèmes électriques sont relativement nouveaux et les mécaniciens ne sont pas encore familiers avec cela. Étant donné qu’une grande partie du groupe motopropulseur fonctionne avec des composants électroniques, il peut parfois s’avérer difficile de trouver le problème s’il y en a un.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Les voitures électriques et hybrides sont plus profitables dans un contexte urbain. Toutefois, les gens qui habitent en ville n’ont souvent pas accès à une prise électrique extérieure pour pouvoir recharger les batteries de certains véhicules. Ceci amène donc la question des infrastructures, qui est encore peu courante au Québec. Toutefois, avec la demande qui grimpe sans cesse, il est évident que les infrastructures deviendront de plus en plus présentes un peu partout.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Material republished with the express permission of Autonet.ca, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"multimedia_script\">\n<div class=\"scene\">\n<div class=\"displayed_content\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du côté moins écologique de la voiture électrique.

D’abord pour dire qu’ils n’étaient pas au courant que voilà 50 ans, les premiers Marocains arrivaient sur le territoire belge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">On entend souvent parler des jeunes d’origine marocaine. En réalité, que reste-t-il de «&nbsp;marocain&nbsp;» chez eux&nbsp;? L’identité multiple qui les habite montre que ce n’est qu’une partie de ce qu’ils sont. Une partie qui semble devenir de plus en plus petite, au profit d’autres éléments. Mais cette complexité identitaire est difficile à vivre pour les jeunes. Ils sont à la fois d’ici et de là-bas. Un là-bas qui fait parfois référence au pays d’origine, mais plus souvent à une région, ou un village d’origine. Ici, c’est la difficulté de vivre la culture occidentale et une certaine forme de religiosité à la fois. Difficulté d’être accepté par l’autre comme étant d’ici aussi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Difficile aussi de discuter de l’histoire de l’immigration avec ces jeunes. Toutes nos questions sur le moment de leur arrivée en Europe, le chemin parcouru, les raisons du départ, la manière dont ils ont vécu ce moment, leurs rêves, sont restées sans réactions ou font l’objet de réponses approximatives et incertaines. Par contre, ils sont conscients du rêve de leurs parents pour eux, leurs enfants. «&nbsp;Leur sentiment est que leur famille s’est sacrifiée. Pour eux, leur père et leur mère ont dû assumer le coût du déracinement et de l’exil &nbsp;».</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En ce qui concerne l’héritage ouvrier des pères, la réponse doit être plus nuancée. D’une part, ils ont souvent mal connu leur père qui partait tôt le matin et revenait tard le soir fatigué. De quoi amener les jeunes et, souvent leurs parents, à refuser d’imaginer le même avenir. On voit du coup des élèves qui s’inscrivent dans les filières perçues comme «&nbsp;intellectuelles&nbsp;» de l’enseignement professionnel. La recherche d’une possible ascension sociale risque en fait de mener droit au statu quo. Ces filières de l’enseignement professionnel ne préparant pas réellement à un métier. Mais, d’autre part, l’héritage ouvrier des pères est souvent cité par les jeunes pour justifier leur place dans la ville. Ainsi, le rôle des parents dans la construction de la ville est mis en avant comme ayant permis à Bruxelles d’être la ville qu’elle est aujourd’hui. Soheib&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Sans nos parents, à Bruxelles il n’y aurait pas de routes et de rails de tram&nbsp;! C’est eux qui ont construit cette ville&nbsp;». Des propos qui permettent, comme l’explique le sociologue Didier Lapeyronnie, de légitimer la présence sur le sol du pays qu’ils habitent. Cela montre aussi qu’ils s’affirment comme étant d’ici. À partir du moment où l’on a construit cette ville, qui peut encore nous dire qu’on n’est pas d’ici&nbsp;?</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des raisons de l’immigration en Belgique.

D’abord pour dire qu’ils n’étaient pas au courant que voilà 50 ans, les premiers Marocains arrivaient sur le territoire belge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">On entend souvent parler des jeunes d’origine marocaine. En réalité, que reste-t-il de «&nbsp;marocain&nbsp;» chez eux&nbsp;? L’identité multiple qui les habite montre que ce n’est qu’une partie de ce qu’ils sont. Une partie qui semble devenir de plus en plus petite, au profit d’autres éléments. Mais cette complexité identitaire est difficile à vivre pour les jeunes. Ils sont à la fois d’ici et de là-bas. Un là-bas qui fait parfois référence au pays d’origine, mais plus souvent à une région, ou un village d’origine. Ici, c’est la difficulté de vivre la culture occidentale et une certaine forme de religiosité à la fois. Difficulté d’être accepté par l’autre comme étant d’ici aussi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Difficile aussi de discuter de l’histoire de l’immigration avec ces jeunes. Toutes nos questions sur le moment de leur arrivée en Europe, le chemin parcouru, les raisons du départ, la manière dont ils ont vécu ce moment, leurs rêves, sont restées sans réactions ou font l’objet de réponses approximatives et incertaines. Par contre, ils sont conscients du rêve de leurs parents pour eux, leurs enfants. «&nbsp;Leur sentiment est que leur famille s’est sacrifiée. Pour eux, leur père et leur mère ont dû assumer le coût du déracinement et de l’exil &nbsp;».</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En ce qui concerne l’héritage ouvrier des pères, la réponse doit être plus nuancée. D’une part, ils ont souvent mal connu leur père qui partait tôt le matin et revenait tard le soir fatigué. De quoi amener les jeunes et, souvent leurs parents, à refuser d’imaginer le même avenir. On voit du coup des élèves qui s’inscrivent dans les filières perçues comme «&nbsp;intellectuelles&nbsp;» de l’enseignement professionnel. La recherche d’une possible ascension sociale risque en fait de mener droit au statu quo. Ces filières de l’enseignement professionnel ne préparant pas réellement à un métier. Mais, d’autre part, l’héritage ouvrier des pères est souvent cité par les jeunes pour justifier leur place dans la ville. Ainsi, le rôle des parents dans la construction de la ville est mis en avant comme ayant permis à Bruxelles d’être la ville qu’elle est aujourd’hui. Soheib&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Sans nos parents, à Bruxelles il n’y aurait pas de routes et de rails de tram&nbsp;! C’est eux qui ont construit cette ville&nbsp;». Des propos qui permettent, comme l’explique le sociologue Didier Lapeyronnie, de légitimer la présence sur le sol du pays qu’ils habitent. Cela montre aussi qu’ils s’affirment comme étant d’ici.

L’article original a été publié le 31 janvier 2017 en France par Dynamique-mag.com.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">L’influence de la publicité sur les consommateurs</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La publicité se présente comme une forme de communication. Elle cherche à attirer l’attention d’une cible définie au préalable. Son but est clairement incitatif et vise à adopter un comportement souhaité, par exemple, l’achat d’un produit ou d’un service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"font_weight:bold formatted_text\">Des objectifs publicitaires déterminés</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">C’est le besoin qui reste toutefois à l’origine de la majorité des actes d’achats. Les consommateurs qui vont acheter un produit ou un service n’exprime toutefois pas nécessairement de besoin. Un des rôles de la publicité est de créer le besoin. Des personnes qui n’auraient pas forcément besoin d’un produit ou service au départ sont ainsi amenées à avoir l’impression qu’elles en ont tout de même besoin. La publicité crée un sentiment de besoin par l’envie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En termes de communication, la publicité a pour objectif de délivrer un message construit de manière spécifique. Ce message doit être clair, synthétique et argumenté en vue de convaincre le public auquel il s’adresse. Surtout, il est primordial que ce message soit intelligible, c’est-à-dire qu’il soit compréhensible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La publicité promeut des marques et offre au consommateur la possibilité d’appartenir à un certain groupe social. Par exemple, l’influence des marques vestimentaires connaît un fort impact chez les jeunes. Ces derniers voient en cela un moyen d’identification, d’acceptation et d’appartenance à un certain groupe social. Ils constituent une cible très prisée des marques car ils ne se détachent pas de la société de consommation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Les publicités alimentaires se placent comme les principales publicités. La moitié des publicités concernent un produit de nature comestible. Dans une logique concurrentielle, elles se veulent toujours plus appétissantes les unes que les autres. De plus en plus attirantes, et souvent glissées entre les films, elles se montrent très persuasives quand il s’agit d’inciter à l’achat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Après le domaine alimentaire, s’en suit le domaine matériel.

L’article original a été publié le 13&nbsp;février 2018 en Belgique par la journaliste belge Marine Roucourt.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose prose_type:news_article style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Qu’est-ce que la transformation numérique des entreprises&nbsp;?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">De plus en plus souvent sur la toile, on entend parler de transformation numérique (ou digitale) des entreprises. De nombreux articles pullulent dans le but de vanter les bienfaits de ce type de transition pour les entreprises, ses opportunités, ses défis, ses dangers et les procédures à mettre en place afin de devenir cette entreprise numérique sacralisée.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">L’expression «&nbsp;transformation numérique&nbsp;» devient un terme générique derrière lequel on inscrit tout un tas de concepts et d’utilisations, mais qu’est-ce que cela signifie réellement&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Si elle est souvent comprise comme telle, la transformation numérique des activités d’une entreprise ne se limite pas à l’adoption de nouveaux outils créés en masse par l’arrivée des nouvelles technologies. Il ne suffit pas de créer un site d’e-commerce, quelques pages sur les réseaux sociaux et d’installer un intranet pour affirmer que l’entreprise a réalisé une transformation numérique. Si l’adoption de ces nouveaux outils accompagne la transition de l’organisation, cela ne suffit certainement pas à la définir.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En effet, cette transformation comprend l’ensemble des étapes par lesquelles une entreprise devra passer pour évoluer depuis ce qu’elle est aujourd’hui vers ce qu’elle souhaite devenir numériquement. Il s’agit d’un processus complet qui va intégrer de nouveaux usages dans le but de faire évoluer l’entreprise et d’améliorer sa performance et sa compétitivité. La transformation digitale va intégrer les nouvelles technologies afin de soutenir l’organisation et transformer son mode de fonctionnement tout en s’alignant sur les stratégies existantes de l’entreprise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Avec l’essor des nouvelles technologies, le monde et ses habitants sont devenus de plus en plus connectés. Les comportements des consommateurs et des salariés ont changé, de nouveaux usages et besoins sont apparus et ils attendent de l’entreprise qu’elle soit capable d’y répondre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Pouvez-vous encore imaginer demander des informations au sujet d’une entreprise et ne recevoir une réponse que trois semaines plus tard&nbsp;? Ou commander un article et n’être livré qu’au bout de deux semaines&nbsp;? Non. Nous vivons dans un monde où l’immédiateté est devenue la norme et où le consommateur et le salarié ne sont plus patients. Les mentalités ont changé, il semble donc naturel que le monde entrepreneurial en fasse autant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Une organisation qui transforme verra son mode habituel de fonctionnement bouleversé. De nombreux chantiers vont éclore au sein de l’entreprise qui sera poussée à revoir certains de ses aspects opérationnels. L’organisation va devoir apprendre à évoluer dans un monde nouveau sans pour autant rompre avec ses valeurs et son identité.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La révolution numérique ne se suffit pas à elle-même. On constate qu’elle s’accompagne d’une révolution culturelle liée à l’apparition de ces nouveaux usages, modes de communication et commerces. Les mentalités changent, les frontières physiques de l’entreprise s’estompent tellement qu’il devient difficile de les discerner et les salariés demandent plus de flexibilité que jamais. Dans de telles conditions, il est impensable de vouloir à tout prix conserver les modèles traditionnels des organisations.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© INV_2019-7</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des bénéfices perçus de la transformation numérique.

L’article original a été publié en avril 2017 en France sur le site Web Les Échos.fr.  Comment Renault se prépare à la voiture autonome  Le constructeur déploie ses tests en France et vise une commercialisation en 2020. Le mode autonome sera activable seulement dans certaines conditions de sécurité.  Le pilote met le clignotant, lâche le volant, et la voiture glisse d’elle-même sur la file de gauche, en s’insérant naturellement dans sa voie… Bienvenue dans le prototype de voiture autonome de Renault, à bord duquel « Les Echos » ont pu monter ce vendredi. Depuis plus d’un an, la firme au Losange fait ainsi rouler six modèles Espace bardés de multiples capteurs sur les routes de l’Ouest francilien – en l’occurrence sur la N118 à proximité de Boulogne-Billancourt, en direction de Vélizy.  « Dès l’année prochaine, on aura plusieurs dizaines de véhicules sur les routes », indique Laurent Taupin, ingénieur en chef du véhicule autonome de Renault. Dans les prochaines semaines, le groupe va déployer des « tests lambdas » en invitant des clients non experts à se mettre au volant afin de mieux appréhender la réaction de l’individu dans cet environnement totalement nouveau.  Une équipe de 50 personnes (regroupant des ingénieurs maison, mais aussi des partenaires spécialistes en intelligence artificielle, en software, en data…) pilote le programme et multiplie les cas de figures, avec une attention particulièrement poussée sur les situations les plus complexes (tunnels, ponts, chantiers…). Certains scénarios obligent à prendre des largesses par rapport au code de la route. « Par exemple, la réglementation prévoit des distances de sécurité de deux secondes. Mais, dans le cas où un véhicule vous fait une queue de poisson, plutôt que de piler violemment, on va programmer un freinage plus progressif. »  L’objectif final : parvenir au niveau 4 de la conduite autonome, baptisé dans le jargon « hands off, eyes off », avec une commercialisation des premiers modèles en 2020. « À ce stade, le système doit être capable d’assumer seul la conduite dans certaines situations, et le pilote peut alors s’adonner à d’autres activités », poursuit l’ingénieur. Précision importante : la voiture ne sera pas autonome de A à Z mais proposera un mode autonome lorsque les conditions seront totalement réunies. Ainsi, des routes enneigées ou très pluvieuses, ou encore des zones d’accident, devraient rester en mode manuel. « Notre objectif est de redonner du temps aux gens avec une sécurité totale. On ne transige pas là-dessus. »  Certes, certaines marques proposent déjà des assistances à la conduite très évoluées (Tesla, Mercedes), mais à chaque fois le conducteur doit rester impérativement vigilant, les mains sur le volant. Pour pouvoir lire à bord ou regarder ses e-mails, la technologie doit être éprouvée dans le temps, et le cadre réglementaire clarifié (responsabilité en cas d’accident, assurances…).  « Comment Renault se prépare à la voiture autonome », Maxime Amiot, Les Échos.fr, 2017 Dans cette sélection il s’agit de l’avenir de la voiture autonome.

Depuis plus d’un an, la firme au Losange fait ainsi rouler six modèles Espace bardés de multiples capteurs sur les routes de l’Ouest francilien – en l’occurrence sur la N118 à proximité de Boulogne-Billancourt, en direction de Vélizy.  « Dès l’année prochaine, on aura plusieurs dizaines de véhicules sur les routes », indique Laurent Taupin, ingénieur en chef du véhicule autonome de Renault.

Précision importante : la voiture ne sera pas autonome de A à Z mais proposera un mode autonome lorsque les conditions seront totalement réunies.

Le ministère de l’intérieur a assuré que le système à la base de la polémique, UberPOP, ne sera plus au 1<sup>er</sup> janvier prochain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le gouvernement français a annoncé lundi, à la satisfaction des chauffeurs de taxi en colère, l’interdiction au 1<sup>er</sup> janvier de l’application UberPOP, offre payante de transport entre particuliers proposée par la société américaine Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le porte-parole du ministère de l’intérieur a expliqué que ce serait chose faite avec l’entrée en vigueur de la loi Thévenoud sur la régulation de la concurrence avec les taxis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">À la question «&nbsp;Cette application sera-t-elle interdite à brève échéance&nbsp;?&nbsp;», Pierre-Henry Brandet a répondu «&nbsp;absolument&nbsp;» sur iTELE, au moment où les taxis ralentissaient les accès à Paris pour dénoncer cette application, qui constitue selon eux une «&nbsp;concurrence déloyale&nbsp;» et n’a pas été interdite en urgence vendredi par le tribunal de commerce.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La mise en relation de particuliers grâce à des systèmes comme UberPOP sera passible de deux ans de prison et de 300 000 euros d’amende, a indiqué le porte-parole du ministère de l’intérieur&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Non seulement c’est illégal de se prêter à ce service mais en plus pour le consommateur il y a un véritable danger&nbsp;», a-t-il poursuivi, soulignant que les conducteurs n’avaient pas d’assurance adéquate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">«&nbsp;La loi qui a été votée et portée par le gouvernement de réglementation de la profession de taxi, des VTC (voitures de tourisme avec chauffeur), qui entrera en vigueur le 1<sup>er</sup> janvier prochain, est encore plus contraignante pour ce genre de société&nbsp;», a encore dit Pierre-Henry Brandet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le Premier ministre, Manuel Valls, s’est défendu de prendre parti pour la corporation des taxis. «&nbsp;Nous ne cédons à aucune corporation, nous appliquons la loi&nbsp;», a-t-il dit en marge d’un déplacement, soulignant que les décrets d’application de la loi Thévenoud pourraient être signés dans les prochains jours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Dans un communiqué, l’Union nationale des taxis (UNT) a dit accueillir «&nbsp;avec beaucoup de satisfaction&nbsp;» les déclarations du gouvernement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">«&nbsp;Il n’était pas concevable que le gouvernement laisse une start-up américaine organiser du travail clandestin en France en toute impunité&nbsp;», écrit dans un communiqué son président, Alain Griset.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La branche française d’Uber a été condamnée en octobre dernier à une amende de 100 000 euros pour «&nbsp;pratiques commerciales trompeuses&nbsp;» pour avoir présenté UberPOP comme du covoiturage. Uber a fait appel de cette décision et continue de proposer ce service.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© L'argus.fr</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du covoiturage dans différents pays européens.

Cette interdiction devrait voir le jour en 2018.</p>\n\n<p class=\"standalone_statement style:1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Les effets sont désastreux pour la sociabilité en classe</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"standalone_statement style:1\">Philippe Donatien, Secrétaire général du Syndicat indépendant des personnels de direction de l’éducation nationale</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Les portables perturbent le fonctionnement d’un établissement, et ce à plusieurs niveaux. Ils ont un impact négatif, déjà connu depuis longtemps, en termes pédagogiques et disciplinaires. Avec Internet, il est devenu ingérable de lutter contre la triche, et les professeurs ne sont pas là pour traquer les téléphones pendant les contrôles. Par ailleurs, je pense que le droit à la déconnexion devrait aussi concerner les enfants, et que nous sommes face à un réel enjeu de santé publique. Les effets sont désastreux pour la sociabilité en classe. Les téléphones mobiles et la fascination qu’ils exercent n’aident pas les enfants à devenir des citoyens. Certains n’échangent plus du tout avec les autres élèves pendant le temps scolaire et connaissent à peine leurs camarades. Il faut que les parents arrêtent de légitimer cet usage permanent. Il est inadmissible qu’ils tentent de communiquer avec leur enfant lorsqu’il est en classe. En cas d’authentique urgence, je sais par expérience que le rôle d’intermédiaire du personnel éducatif est essentiel. L’école se doit d’éloigner les portables parce que son rôle est aussi de préserver les enfants de situations familiales parfois compliquées. Enfin, cela provoque des dysfonctionnements importants dans les établissements. Les élèves peuvent envoyer en direct depuis la classe des informations complètement erronées à leurs parents. J’ai connu des cas où ces derniers faisaient irruption dans la salle de cours en pleine journée pour s’en prendre à un enseignant qui aurait causé du tort à leur enfant, et c’est évidemment inacceptable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Pour toutes ces raisons, je suis favorable à l’interdiction des portables. Mais de tels effets d’annonce peuvent s’avérer pervers s’ils ne sont pas suivis de faits. Cela nous décrédibilise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En revanche, je me demande quelle décision on peut prendre pour que ce soit applicable. Soyons réalistes, pour que le portable soit interdit à l’entrée des collèges, il faudrait prévoir un lieu où les élèves le déposent chaque matin, et s’assurer que chacun récupère bien le sien le soir. Ce serait l’idéal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais aujourd’hui, c’est techniquement impossible. Je crains qu’on n’aboutisse à la même position paradoxale qu’avec la cigarette, dont l’interdiction théorique ne s’est jamais concrétisée, faute de consigne claire. J’appelle donc à ce qu’on nous donne le cadre légal nécessaire. Dans le cas contraire, nous serons forcément ridicules, et les parents pourront contester nos mesures. Le problème dans ce genre de débats, c’est qu’on nous envoie toujours au front sans garanties.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">«&nbsp;La question du jour&nbsp;: Faut-il interdire les téléphones portables au collège&nbsp;?&nbsp;», Lucie Alexandre, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">La Croix</span>, 2017</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit de l’interdiction de l’usage des téléphones portables.

L’article original a été publié le 13&nbsp;février 2018 en Belgique par la journaliste belge Marine Roucourt.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose prose_type:news_article style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Qu’est-ce que la transformation numérique des entreprises&nbsp;?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">De plus en plus souvent sur la toile, on entend parler de transformation numérique (ou digitale) des entreprises. De nombreux articles pullulent dans le but de vanter les bienfaits de ce type de transition pour les entreprises, ses opportunités, ses défis, ses dangers et les procédures à mettre en place afin de devenir cette entreprise numérique sacralisée.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">L’expression «&nbsp;transformation numérique&nbsp;» devient un terme générique derrière lequel on inscrit tout un tas de concepts et d’utilisations, mais qu’est-ce que cela signifie réellement&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Si elle est souvent comprise comme telle, la transformation numérique des activités d’une entreprise ne se limite pas à l’adoption de nouveaux outils créés en masse par l’arrivée des nouvelles technologies. Il ne suffit pas de créer un site d’e-commerce, quelques pages sur les réseaux sociaux et d’installer un intranet pour affirmer que l’entreprise a réalisé une transformation numérique. Si l’adoption de ces nouveaux outils accompagne la transition de l’organisation, cela ne suffit certainement pas à la définir.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En effet, cette transformation comprend l’ensemble des étapes par lesquelles une entreprise devra passer pour évoluer depuis ce qu’elle est aujourd’hui vers ce qu’elle souhaite devenir numériquement. Il s’agit d’un processus complet qui va intégrer de nouveaux usages dans le but de faire évoluer l’entreprise et d’améliorer sa performance et sa compétitivité. La transformation digitale va intégrer les nouvelles technologies afin de soutenir l’organisation et transformer son mode de fonctionnement tout en s’alignant sur les stratégies existantes de l’entreprise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Avec l’essor des nouvelles technologies, le monde et ses habitants sont devenus de plus en plus connectés. Les comportements des consommateurs et des salariés ont changé, de nouveaux usages et besoins sont apparus et ils attendent de l’entreprise qu’elle soit capable d’y répondre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Pouvez-vous encore imaginer demander des informations au sujet d’une entreprise et ne recevoir une réponse que trois semaines plus tard&nbsp;? Ou commander un article et n’être livré qu’au bout de deux semaines&nbsp;? Non. Nous vivons dans un monde où l’immédiateté est devenue la norme et où le consommateur et le salarié ne sont plus patients. Les mentalités ont changé, il semble donc naturel que le monde entrepreneurial en fasse autant.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Une organisation qui transforme verra son mode habituel de fonctionnement bouleversé. De nombreux chantiers vont éclore au sein de l’entreprise qui sera poussée à revoir certains de ses aspects opérationnels. L’organisation va devoir apprendre à évoluer dans un monde nouveau sans pour autant rompre avec ses valeurs et son identité.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La révolution numérique ne se suffit pas à elle-même. On constate qu’elle s’accompagne d’une révolution culturelle liée à l’apparition de ces nouveaux usages, modes de communication et commerces. Les mentalités changent, les frontières physiques de l’entreprise s’estompent tellement qu’il devient difficile de les discerner et les salariés demandent plus de flexibilité que jamais. Dans de telles conditions, il est impensable de vouloir à tout prix conserver les modèles traditionnels des organisations.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© INV_2019-7</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des bénéfices perçus de la transformation numérique.

L’article original a été publié en avril 2017 en France sur le site Web Les Échos.fr.  Comment Renault se prépare à la voiture autonome  Le constructeur déploie ses tests en France et vise une commercialisation en 2020. Le mode autonome sera activable seulement dans certaines conditions de sécurité.  Le pilote met le clignotant, lâche le volant, et la voiture glisse d’elle-même sur la file de gauche, en s’insérant naturellement dans sa voie… Bienvenue dans le prototype de voiture autonome de Renault, à bord duquel « Les Echos » ont pu monter ce vendredi. Depuis plus d’un an, la firme au Losange fait ainsi rouler six modèles Espace bardés de multiples capteurs sur les routes de l’Ouest francilien – en l’occurrence sur la N118 à proximité de Boulogne-Billancourt, en direction de Vélizy.  « Dès l’année prochaine, on aura plusieurs dizaines de véhicules sur les routes », indique Laurent Taupin, ingénieur en chef du véhicule autonome de Renault. Dans les prochaines semaines, le groupe va déployer des « tests lambdas » en invitant des clients non experts à se mettre au volant afin de mieux appréhender la réaction de l’individu dans cet environnement totalement nouveau.  Une équipe de 50 personnes (regroupant des ingénieurs maison, mais aussi des partenaires spécialistes en intelligence artificielle, en software, en data…) pilote le programme et multiplie les cas de figures, avec une attention particulièrement poussée sur les situations les plus complexes (tunnels, ponts, chantiers…). Certains scénarios obligent à prendre des largesses par rapport au code de la route. « Par exemple, la réglementation prévoit des distances de sécurité de deux secondes. Mais, dans le cas où un véhicule vous fait une queue de poisson, plutôt que de piler violemment, on va programmer un freinage plus progressif. »  L’objectif final : parvenir au niveau 4 de la conduite autonome, baptisé dans le jargon « hands off, eyes off », avec une commercialisation des premiers modèles en 2020. « À ce stade, le système doit être capable d’assumer seul la conduite dans certaines situations, et le pilote peut alors s’adonner à d’autres activités », poursuit l’ingénieur. Précision importante : la voiture ne sera pas autonome de A à Z mais proposera un mode autonome lorsque les conditions seront totalement réunies. Ainsi, des routes enneigées ou très pluvieuses, ou encore des zones d’accident, devraient rester en mode manuel. « Notre objectif est de redonner du temps aux gens avec une sécurité totale. On ne transige pas là-dessus. »  Certes, certaines marques proposent déjà des assistances à la conduite très évoluées (Tesla, Mercedes), mais à chaque fois le conducteur doit rester impérativement vigilant, les mains sur le volant. Pour pouvoir lire à bord ou regarder ses e-mails, la technologie doit être éprouvée dans le temps, et le cadre réglementaire clarifié (responsabilité en cas d’accident, assurances…).  « Comment Renault se prépare à la voiture autonome », Maxime Amiot, Les Échos.fr, 2017 Dans cette sélection il s’agit de l’avenir de la voiture autonome.

Derrière cette grande fête du livre se cache toutefois une dure réalité.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En 2008, 65&nbsp;% des écrivains québécois ont tiré moins de 5&nbsp;000&nbsp;$ de leur travail de création littéraire, contre 22&nbsp;% qui ont réussi à gagner de 5&nbsp;000&nbsp;$ à 19&nbsp;999&nbsp;$, révèle l’Enquête auprès des écrivains (2010) de l’Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ) et de l’Observatoire de la culture et des communications du Québec (OCCQ). Avec de tels revenus, difficile de vivre simplement de son œuvre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">C’est le cas de Louise Portal. Elle a écrit 16 livres, dont un best-seller qui s’est vendu à 25&nbsp;000 exemplaires. Malgré cela, elle ne peut pas compter seulement sur ses talents d’écrivaine. «&nbsp;J’ai eu un assez bon chèque de droits d’auteur, mais je suis très loin de pouvoir gagner ma vie avec ma plume. Et c’est pour ça qu’on doit parler de cette journée du livre et du droit d’auteur&nbsp;», plaide-t-elle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Comme les auteurs reçoivent en redevances en moyenne 10&nbsp;% du montant de chaque livre vendu, il faut connaître tout un succès en librairie pour s’enrichir avec son écriture. Grâce à ses séries à succès dont <span class=\"published_title\">Les Chevaliers d’Émeraude</span> et <span class=\"published_title\">A.N.G.E.</span>, l’écrivaine Anne Robillard fait partie de la poignée d’écrivains québécois qui vivent de leur plume. Son secret&nbsp;? «&nbsp;Il faut écrire beaucoup, ça, je peux vous le dire. Mon surnom dans le milieu, c’est la machine. J’aime écrire. C’est mon travail de 6 h le matin à 9 h le soir&nbsp;», confie-t-elle. Avec 57 ouvrages à son actif, elle affirme avoir vendu près de 5 millions de livres en 13 ans. Elle ajoute que si elle réussit à se consacrer à plein temps à l’écriture, c’est parce qu’elle reçoit 40&nbsp;% de redevances et non pas 10&nbsp;%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais publier à compte d’auteur, c’est aussi cumuler une autre charge de travail, et n’obtenir aucune subvention du gouvernement, «&nbsp;parce qu’on n’est pas éditeur&nbsp;».</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Toujours selon l’ISQ et l’OCCQ, il s’est vendu au Québec en 2015 pour plus de 608 millions de dollars de livres.

L’article original a été publié le 5 septembre 2014 en Belgique par Marie Daffe, stagiaire au site Web FocusVif.be.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Les œuvres d’art doivent-elles être rendues à leur pays d’origine&nbsp;?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La question se pose à chaque restitution d’œuvre d’un pays à un autre. Mais la réponse n’est ni simple, ni unique, car les enjeux vont bien au-delà de l’aspect purement patrimonial.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Il y a à peine quelques jours, l’Espagne a rendu à la Colombie près de 700 objets d’art précolombien. L’ensemble avait été saisi lors d’une opération anti-drogue en... 2003&nbsp;! La Colombie a dû batailler ferme pour éviter que les objets ne restent en Espagne indéfiniment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"font_weight:bold formatted_text\">Souci de préservation</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Ce qui freine les demandes de restitution, c’est la peur des musées occidentaux de voir les objets conservés dans de mauvaises conditions, voire victimes de vandalisme. Une crainte qui n’est pas totalement sans fondement. Lors de troubles politiques en 1997, une trentaine d’objets restitués par la Belgique au Congo ont été dérobés au Musée national de Kinshasa. Les musées égyptiens ont également souffert de vandalisme et de pillages durant le Printemps arabe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"font_weight:bold formatted_text\">Œuvre d’art contre pétrole</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais certains ont flairé un bon filon avec la restitution d’objets d’art. Et ne s’en cachent pas. En 2008, l’Italie rend à la Libye la <span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">Vénus de Cyrène</span>, une statue de marbre dont elle s’était emparée à l’époque où la Libye formait l’une de ses colonies. La restitution intervient après un «&nbsp;accord d’amitié&nbsp;» entre les dirigeants des deux pays, à l’époque Silvio Berlusconi et Mouammar Kadhafi. Un accord avant tout guidé par l’intérêt économique, comme l’explique sans détour Berlusconi au travers de déclarations surprenantes&nbsp;: «&nbsp;L’accord nous permettra d’avoir moins de clandestins et plus de gaz et de pétrole libyen, qui est d’une excellente qualité.&nbsp;» Là encore, les bonnes intentions n’étaient qu’une façade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"font_weight:bold formatted_text\">En Belgique</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Les demandes de restitution n’émanent pas toutes d’anciennes colonies. C’est ainsi que la Belgique réclame depuis plusieurs années au Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes le retour du <span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">Triomphe de Judas Macchabée</span>, un tableau de Rubens. L’œuvre a été dérobée en 1794 dans la cathédrale de Tournai par des révolutionnaires français. Les dernières nouvelles ne sont pas bonnes pour la Belgique, puisque l’ancienne ministre de la culture française a refusé en avril de rendre le tableau à la ville de Tournai. Pour la ministre, la question de la restitution d’œuvres dérobées par les révolutionnaires a été réglée en 1815 par la Conférence de Vienne. Conférence à laquelle la Belgique n’a pas participé puisqu’elle n’existait tout simplement pas encore&nbsp;! Richard Miller (MR), qui est à l’initiative de la demande, a d’ores et déjà fait savoir qu’il continuerait à réclamer le tableau au nouveau gouvernement français.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des musées ayant une importante collection d’antiquités égyptiennes.

Le roman original intitulé <span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">Le Don</span> a été publié en 1987 au Canada par les écrivains canadiens Yves Beauchesne et David Schinkel. Joëlle parle de l’héritage qu’elle vient de recevoir.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose prose_type:short_story style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">À son pupitre, elle tira sur la petite chaîne qui pendait d’un abat-jour en verre vert. Sous la lumière, les contours de plusieurs taches d’eau se précisèrent sur l’enveloppe froissée. C’était pourtant le paquet qui intriguait Joëlle. La lettre, elle, pouvait attendre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Ça devait être un bijou ancien que sa tante lui avait légué là. Peut-être même un rang de perles. Joëlle n’avait bien sûr aucune raison véritable de soupçonner cela. C’était une impression, rien de plus. Mais n’était-ce pas le genre de chose que les vieilles filles avaient l’habitude de donner&nbsp;? Cela serait comme un héritage qu’elle pourrait à son tour donner en partage à sa propre fille. Elle cassa la ficelle et arracha le papier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Une odeur de lavande lui chatouilla les narines. Une fragrance faible et comme venue de très loin. Lorsqu’elle ouvrit le paquet, une pluie de fleurs séchées s’épandit sur le pupitre. Joëlle en cueillit une et la porta à son nez. Comme tante Émilie était morte depuis plusieurs années, ces fleurs-là devaient être bien vieilles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le papier gercé comme une peau usée se craquela quand vint le moment de révéler enfin son précieux secret. À la vue de l’objet, le désenchantement s’empara de Joëlle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Ce n’était rien d’autre qu’un livre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Un tout petit livre recouvert de velours marron, usé jusqu’au beige vers la tranche, mais paré encore de beaux reflets moirés presque partout. D’une main, Joëlle le souleva, soufflant la lavande séchée qui voulait s’y accrocher. Au centre, vers le bas, elle remarqua quelque chose d’inscrit en lettres dorées et en relief. Elle rapprocha le livre de la lumière et lut : JOURNAL.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Son journal, c’était donc ça le cadeau de tante Émilie.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">D’un coup de pouce, Joëlle ouvrit la couverture et feuilleta le livre en commençant par la fin. Toutes les pages semblaient intactes. Le papier était épais et vieilli ; la tranche, elle, était raboteuse, comme si les feuilles avaient été déchirées, plutôt que coupées, aux dimensions du livre. Il sembla à Joëlle que ce journal devait déjà être ancien lorsque tante Émilie l’avait rangé en lieu sûr.

L’article original a été publié le 30 janvier 2017 en France par le site Web du journal <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Contrepoints</span>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Idée reçue&nbsp;:&nbsp;«&nbsp;le capitalisme est anti-écologique&nbsp;»</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Le système capitaliste, c’est mauvais pour la planète&nbsp;? Au contraire, la propriété privée incite à mieux respecter l’environnement.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La rengaine est connue, notre société de consommation nous mènerait au désastre, le capitalisme est mauvais pour la planète.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">C’est vite oublier que par essence le capitalisme est un système qui tend à optimiser la gestion des ressources, y compris les ressources naturelles, et que malheureusement les désastres écologiques ont plus souvent eu lieu sous des régimes collectivistes que sous des régimes capitalistes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Dans une économie capitaliste, les droits de propriété sont respectés, les individus sont libres et l’intervention du gouvernement est limitée. Un système collectiviste est l’exact opposé&nbsp;: la propriété privée est abolie, les individus ne sont pas libres et l’État dicte la vie de ses citoyens.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Un exemple de gestion privée et de gestion publique </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Maintenant que ces bases sont posées, prenons deux pays&nbsp;: la Capitalie et la Collectivie. Ces deux pays se partagent une île où règne une grande forêt luxuriante abritant quantité d’animaux sauvages, arbres fruitiers et sources d’eau fraîche. Néanmoins, au gré de leur histoire, la Capitalie et la Collectivie ont opté pour deux modèles différents de société&nbsp;: la Capitalie a choisi le système capitaliste, la Collectivie, le système collectiviste.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En Collectivie, la forêt appartient à chacun puisque c’est un bien public. Dès lors chacun est libre de l’utiliser comme il le souhaite, si c’est à tout le monde, c’est un peu à moi aussi. Certains individus commencent alors à scier les arbres pour construire des maisons et se chauffer. D’autres en voyant que certains avaient pris la liberté de scier les arbres de la forêt se disent&nbsp;: si eux le font, j’en ai aussi le droit puisque la forêt est un bien public.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En Capitalie, la forêt est découpée en portions qui sont la propriété des individus. Ces derniers, parce qu’ils sont propriétaires effectifs d’une portion ont tout intérêt à ne pas abattre trop d’arbres au risque de perdre leur portion de forêt. Cette dernière mettant beaucoup de temps à repousser, chacun est poussé à gérer au mieux sa portion afin de ne pas détruire trop vite ses ressources en bois.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Nous pourrions continuer cette comparaison sur bien d’autres points, néanmoins, je pense que vous avez compris l’idée sous-jacente. Un système collectiviste dilue la responsabilité si bien que personne ne se sent responsable de rien et personne ne cherche à mieux gérer les ressources naturelles. À l’inverse, un système capitaliste pousse les individus à mieux gérer leurs ressources, que celles-ci soient financières, humaines ou naturelles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Parce qu’il déresponsabilise les individus, le collectivisme encourage les individus à consommer plus qu’ils ne l’auraient fait si les biens et services avaient appartenu à des personnes définies. Son aboutissement ne peut donc être que la pénurie, y compris de ressources naturelles. Comme le disait Milton Friedman, «&nbsp;<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">if you put the Federal Government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there’d be a shortage of sand.</span>&nbsp;»</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit de l’opinion des Français sur le sujet du capitalisme.

Selon le Raft, les patients maliens qui ont bénéficié d’une échographie à distance ont économisé en moyenne 35 000 francs CFA (53 €) par consultation, sur le coût du transport s’ils avaient dû se rendre à Bamako. « De toute façon, si on leur dit de faire 1 000 kilomètres pour passer un examen à la capitale, la plupart des patients ne partent pas, ils restent chez eux », poursuit le docteur Bakayoko.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Autre avantage : une meilleure surveillance des épidémies et des maladies qui se répandent rapidement, notamment le paludisme. Au Mali, des petits centres de santé à l’intérieur du pays recueillent les données épidémiologiques et les envoient par téléphone portable au niveau régional, puis national.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">La télémédecine, une aubaine pour les pays d’Afrique aux systèmes de santé globalement défaillants ? Le professeur ivoirien Ehua en est convaincu. « Les nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication (NTIC) permettent d’améliorer les soins et rendre leur accès plus équitable », résume-t-il.</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><div class=\"multimedia_script\"><div class=\"scene\"><div class=\"displayed_content\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des points faibles de la médecine à distance.

Parlant des difficultés auxquelles sont confrontés chefs d’entreprise et particuliers dans son pays, le Congolais évoque une situation qui frise l’absurde. « Si vous allez au fin fond du Congo, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver un réseau téléphonique. En revanche, si la batterie de votre téléphone est déchargée, vous êtes paumé... Parce que vous ne pourrez pas la recharger faute d’électricité. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Le vice-président du Forum des chefs d’entreprise (FCE) et directeur du Management Development International Institute (MDI), Brahim Benabdeslem, raconte cette anecdote pour démontrer la nécessité de nouer des partenariats entre les opérateurs économiques algériens et subsahariens. « L’Algérie affiche le taux d’électrification le plus important du continent. Il est de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"99 %\"><math alttext=\"99 %\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>99</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mtext>  %</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> pour un territoire de plus de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2,3\"><math alttext=\"2,3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> millions de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"kilomètres carrés\"><math alttext=\"kilomètres carrés\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math></span></span>.

Et dans bien d’autres encore. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Ces deux verbes seront conjugués à tous les temps lors du grand rendez-vous qui va se tenir début décembre au tout nouveau Centre international des conférences Abdelatif-Rahal d’Alger, inauguré en septembre.

Débats et échanges s’articuleront autour de plusieurs thématiques : sécurité alimentaire et développement de l’agriculture, sécurité énergétique, énergies renouvelables, financement, transition numérique et capital humain.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Pourquoi un forum d’affaires africain ? « Les pays du continent ont enregistré au cours des dix dernières années des taux de croissance à deux chiffres. Cette croissance offre d’immenses opportunités pour les investissements », note Toufik Lerari, cofondateur de l’agence de communication Allégorie.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Toutefois, ce potentiel de développement n’est pas suffisamment exploité. Ce forum doit donc nous permettre de réfléchir aux problématiques d’affaires et d’investissements sur l’ensemble du continent. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">L’Algérie a des atouts à faire valoir aussi bien sur le plan de son histoire et de sa diplomatie que sur celui de son économie. « Notre pays est le plus grand d’Afrique de par sa superficie, il possède le plus vaste réseau routier avec <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"112 000 kilomètres\"><math alttext=\"112 000 kilomètres\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>112</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mn>000</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> et des réserves de change évaluées à près de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"126\"><math alttext=\"126\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>126</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> milliards de dollars », rappelle Brahim Benabdeslem.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Notre marché doit être orienté vers l’Afrique, et j’encourage tous les investisseurs algériens à réfléchir pour développer l’exportation sur le continent », martèle Ali Haddad, président du FCE et PDG du groupe ETRHB. « Nous avons déjà commencé à préparer le terrain, notamment avec le Sénégal », poursuit-il. « Mais demain, les trams et les autorails fabriqués à Annaba (est du pays) pourraient satisfaire les besoins de toute l’Afrique. »</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du commerce extérieur de l’Algérie par région.

Parlant des difficultés auxquelles sont confrontés chefs d’entreprise et particuliers dans son pays, le Congolais évoque une situation qui frise l’absurde. « Si vous allez au fin fond du Congo, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver un réseau téléphonique. En revanche, si la batterie de votre téléphone est déchargée, vous êtes paumé... Parce que vous ne pourrez pas la recharger faute d’électricité. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Le vice-président du Forum des chefs d’entreprise (FCE) et directeur du Management Development International Institute (MDI), Brahim Benabdeslem, raconte cette anecdote pour démontrer la nécessité de nouer des partenariats entre les opérateurs économiques algériens et subsahariens. « L’Algérie affiche le taux d’électrification le plus important du continent. Il est de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"99 %\"><math alttext=\"99 %\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>99</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mtext>  %</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> pour un territoire de plus de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2,3\"><math alttext=\"2,3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> millions de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"kilomètres carrés\"><math alttext=\"kilomètres carrés\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math></span></span>. Nous pouvons donc <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">partager</span> et <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">exporter</span> l’expertise algérienne dans ce domaine. Et dans bien d’autres encore. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Ces deux verbes seront conjugués à tous les temps lors du grand rendez-vous qui va se tenir début décembre au tout nouveau Centre international des conférences Abdelatif-Rahal d’Alger, inauguré en septembre. En partenariat avec le ministère algérien des Affaires étrangères et celui de l’Industrie et des Mines, le FCE organise, du <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"3\"><math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> au 5 décembre, son premier Forum africain d’investissements et d’affaires.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Les organisateurs de ce forum attendent une participation remarquable, tant en quantité qu’en qualité. Débats et échanges s’articuleront autour de plusieurs thématiques : sécurité alimentaire et développement de l’agriculture, sécurité énergétique, énergies renouvelables, financement, transition numérique et capital humain.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Pourquoi un forum d’affaires africain ? « Les pays du continent ont enregistré au cours des dix dernières années des taux de croissance à deux chiffres. Cette croissance offre d’immenses opportunités pour les investissements », note Toufik Lerari, cofondateur de l’agence de communication Allégorie.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Toutefois, ce potentiel de développement n’est pas suffisamment exploité. Ce forum doit donc nous permettre de réfléchir aux problématiques d’affaires et d’investissements sur l’ensemble du continent. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">L’Algérie a des atouts à faire valoir aussi bien sur le plan de son histoire et de sa diplomatie que sur celui de son économie. « Notre pays est le plus grand d’Afrique de par sa superficie, il possède le plus vaste réseau routier avec <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"112 000 kilomètres\"><math alttext=\"112 000 kilomètres\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>112</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mn>000</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> et des réserves de change évaluées à près de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"126\"><math alttext=\"126\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>126</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> milliards de dollars », rappelle Brahim Benabdeslem.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Notre marché doit être orienté vers l’Afrique, et j’encourage tous les investisseurs algériens à réfléchir pour développer l’exportation sur le continent », martèle Ali Haddad, président du FCE et PDG du groupe ETRHB. « Nous avons déjà commencé à préparer le terrain, notamment avec le Sénégal », poursuit-il. « Mais demain, les trams et les autorails fabriqués à Annaba (est du pays) pourraient satisfaire les besoins de toute l’Afrique. »</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du commerce extérieur de l’Algérie par région.

Parlant des difficultés auxquelles sont confrontés chefs d’entreprise et particuliers dans son pays, le Congolais évoque une situation qui frise l’absurde. « Si vous allez au fin fond du Congo, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver un réseau téléphonique. En revanche, si la batterie de votre téléphone est déchargée, vous êtes paumé... Parce que vous ne pourrez pas la recharger faute d’électricité. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Le vice-président du Forum des chefs d’entreprise (FCE) et directeur du Management Development International Institute (MDI), Brahim Benabdeslem, raconte cette anecdote pour démontrer la nécessité de nouer des partenariats entre les opérateurs économiques algériens et subsahariens. « L’Algérie affiche le taux d’électrification le plus important du continent. Il est de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"99 %\"><math alttext=\"99 %\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>99</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mtext>  %</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> pour un territoire de plus de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"2,3\"><math alttext=\"2,3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> millions de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"kilomètres carrés\"><math alttext=\"kilomètres carrés\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msup><mrow><mstyle><mrow><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math></span></span>. Nous pouvons donc <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">partager</span> et <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">exporter</span> l’expertise algérienne dans ce domaine. Et dans bien d’autres encore. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Ces deux verbes seront conjugués à tous les temps lors du grand rendez-vous qui va se tenir début décembre au tout nouveau Centre international des conférences Abdelatif-Rahal d’Alger, inauguré en septembre. En partenariat avec le ministère algérien des Affaires étrangères et celui de l’Industrie et des Mines, le FCE organise, du <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"3\"><math alttext=\"3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> au 5 décembre, son premier Forum africain d’investissements et d’affaires.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Les organisateurs de ce forum attendent une participation remarquable, tant en quantité qu’en qualité. Débats et échanges s’articuleront autour de plusieurs thématiques : sécurité alimentaire et développement de l’agriculture, sécurité énergétique, énergies renouvelables, financement, transition numérique et capital humain.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Pourquoi un forum d’affaires africain ? « Les pays du continent ont enregistré au cours des dix dernières années des taux de croissance à deux chiffres. Cette croissance offre d’immenses opportunités pour les investissements », note Toufik Lerari, cofondateur de l’agence de communication Allégorie.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Toutefois, ce potentiel de développement n’est pas suffisamment exploité. Ce forum doit donc nous permettre de réfléchir aux problématiques d’affaires et d’investissements sur l’ensemble du continent. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">L’Algérie a des atouts à faire valoir aussi bien sur le plan de son histoire et de sa diplomatie que sur celui de son économie. « Notre pays est le plus grand d’Afrique de par sa superficie, il possède le plus vaste réseau routier avec <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"112 000 kilomètres\"><math alttext=\"112 000 kilomètres\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>112</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mn>000</mn><mspace depth=\"0.0ex\" height=\"0.0ex\" width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mstyle mathvariant=\"normal\"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> et des réserves de change évaluées à près de <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"126\"><math alttext=\"126\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>126</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> milliards de dollars », rappelle Brahim Benabdeslem.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Notre marché doit être orienté vers l’Afrique, et j’encourage tous les investisseurs algériens à réfléchir pour développer l’exportation sur le continent », martèle Ali Haddad, président du FCE et PDG du groupe ETRHB. « Nous avons déjà commencé à préparer le terrain, notamment avec le Sénégal », poursuit-il. « Mais demain, les trams et les autorails fabriqués à Annaba (est du pays) pourraient satisfaire les besoins de toute l’Afrique. »</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du commerce extérieur de l’Algérie par région.

Parlant des difficultés auxquelles sont confrontés chefs d’entreprise et particuliers dans son pays, le Congolais évoque une situation qui frise l’absurde. « Si vous allez au fin fond du Congo, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver un réseau téléphonique. En revanche, si la batterie de votre téléphone est déchargée, vous êtes paumé... Parce que vous ne pourrez pas la recharger faute d’électricité. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Le vice-président du Forum des chefs d’entreprise (FCE) et directeur du Management Development International Institute (MDI), Brahim Benabdeslem, raconte cette anecdote pour démontrer la nécessité de nouer des partenariats entre les opérateurs économiques algériens et subsahariens. « L’Algérie affiche le taux d’électrification le plus important du continent.

class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit du développement des pratiques médicales à distance en Afrique. L’article original a été publié le 10 juin 2013 en France par le journaliste français Olivier Monnier.</p><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose prose_type:news_article style:1\"><div class=\"title\"><p class=\"title_line passage-title\">La télémédecine, une chance pour l’Afrique</p></div><p class=\"passage_para\">Les pratiques médicales à distance par Internet se développent depuis quelques années sur tout le continent africain. Elles permettent de combler certaines lacunes de systèmes de santé défaillants et inéquitables.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Ce matin-là, François Akagblan, stomatologue au centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) de Cocody à Abidjan, discute le cas d’un patient avec l’un de ses confrères. Scène banale, à ceci près que ce confrère travaille au CHU de Strasbourg, à plusieurs milliers de kilomètres.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Le patient a été blessé au visage. Le chirurgien de Strasbourg demande des éléments précis en vue d’une éventuelle opération. « Je lui envoie régulièrement des photos du patient pour lui montrer l’évolution des blessures », poursuit François Akagblan. « Le numérique a bouleversé notre façon de travailler. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">L’an passé au Mali, ils sont près de 2 000 patients à avoir pu effectuer une échographie à distance, et un peu plus de 1 000 à avoir passé un électrocardiogramme dans des conditions similaires. Ces patients dépendent de cinq hôpitaux de district, dans des zones reculées du pays, qui n’ont ni radiologues ni cardiologues. Ces hôpitaux de district sont reliés aux centres médicaux de Bamako, si bien que les examens qui y sont effectués peuvent être interprétés par des spécialistes basés dans la capitale. C’est ce que l’on appelle la téléconsultation ou télé-expertise.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« Le but premier est d’éviter les évacuations sanitaires inutiles et d’appuyer la prise en charge des patients sur place », explique le docteur Cheikh Oumar Bakayoko, coordinateur du Réseau en Afrique francophone pour la télémédecine (Raft), qui regroupe 18 pays. Fort de son succès au Mali, la téléconsultation échographique et cardiologique est en train de se développer un peu partout sur le continent : en République démocratique du Congo, en Mauritanie, en Guinée-Conakry et au Tchad ; le Sénégal et le Burkina Faso devraient suivre.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Parmi les nombreux avantages de la télémédecine, celui de son faible coût est généralement mis en avant. Selon le Raft, les patients maliens qui ont bénéficié d’une échographie à distance ont économisé en moyenne 35 000 francs CFA (53 €) par consultation, sur le coût du transport s’ils avaient dû se rendre à Bamako. « De toute façon, si on leur dit de faire 1 000 kilomètres pour passer un examen à la capitale, la plupart des patients ne partent pas, ils restent chez eux », poursuit le docteur Bakayoko.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Autre avantage : une meilleure surveillance des épidémies et des maladies qui se répandent rapidement, notamment le paludisme. Au Mali, des petits centres de santé à l’intérieur du pays recueillent les données épidémiologiques et les envoient par téléphone portable au niveau régional, puis national.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">La télémédecine, une aubaine pour les pays d’Afrique aux systèmes de santé globalement défaillants ? Le professeur ivoirien Ehua en est convaincu. « Les nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la communication (NTIC) permettent d’améliorer les soins et rendre leur accès plus équitable », résume-t-il.</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><div class=\"multimedia_script\"><div class=\"scene\"><div class=\"displayed_content\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des points faibles de la médecine à distance.

Tous ces artistes se sont engagés dans une coalition pour promouvoir l’<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Histoire générale de l’Afrique</span>. Cette série de huit volumes pédagogiques entamée en 1964 a demandé 35 ans de travail aux plus de 230 historiens mobilisés par l’Unesco. En 2015, l’institution a lancé cette initiative de la coalition des artistes. Avec Cheick Tidiane Seck, Ray Lema en est le porte-parole : « Les artistes doivent se mouiller pour que la connaissance des peuples africains passe dans l’imaginaire des gens. Il ne s’agit pas seulement d'enseigner cette histoire dans les manuels scolaires. On a aussi un rôle important de transmission à jouer. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Également membre de la coalition, Rokia Traoré estime quant à elle que cette initiative peut « mener à une meilleure connaissance de l’histoire de l’Afrique par les Africains et par le reste du monde. Cette histoire multiple, à l’image du continent, doit être examinée dans le détail. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Histoire générale de l’Afrique</span> prouve que cette histoire est chronologiquement traçable. À ce jour, il y a très peu d’informations sur trop d’événements importants sur le continent. La perturbation qu’a représentée la colonisation n’a pas arrangé les choses. La tradition orale, qui est très fragile, a été perturbée. Certaines données fragiles et complexes qui étaient véhiculées par les organisations sociales ont été perturbées pendant plusieurs décennies. C’est pour cela qu’on parle d’histoire générale de l’Afrique... Alors qu’on ne parle pas d’histoire générale de l’Europe. Il faut commencer quelque part cet énorme puzzle fait de tous petits morceaux. »</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Pour reconstituer ce puzzle, la chanteuse malienne a déjà mené des recherches actives : « J’en ai appris un rayon en faisant des recherches pour un monologue musical sur l’empire du Mandé. J'ai été stupéfaite de constater à quel point il n’y a pas d’écrits sur l’histoire de cet empire. J’ai dû m’adresser aux griots de mon pays, qui ne m’ont pas toujours bien accueillie. Bako Dagnon a été une des rares à avoir vraiment pris le temps de me donner des explications. Au départ, nous étions parties pour faire une série de trois interviews. Finalement ça a duré six mois ! » Rokia Traoré tire la sonnette d’alarme sur ce patrimoine malien (et africain) menacé par l’oubli : « C’est une initiative disparate. Il faut vraiment aller chercher les informations. Bako Dagnon a disparu très jeune en emportant beaucoup de connaissances. Il est important de préciser l’histoire liée aux royaumes et empires africains avant qu’il ne soit trop tard. Il faut récolter les témoignages de gens qui ne vont pas tarder à disparaître. Ils sont probablement les derniers à porter des connaissances qui leur ont été transmises par leurs parents selon la tradition orale. »</p><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div></div></div><div class=\"stimulus_block\"><div class=\"multimedia_script\"><div class=\"scene\"><div class=\"displayed_content\"><p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit de l’<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Histoire générale de l’Afrique</span>.

L’engouement est tel que l’offre a dû être augmentée.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Sur une mélodie allègre, pantoufles, pieds nus, baskets et chaussettes anti-glisse frappent le sol en cadence. « Que doit-on faire ? » demande l’un des participants. « Jouer les modèles et marcher comme des stars », lui explique sa voisine.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Sommes-nous à la répétition d’un défilé de mode pour débutants ? Pas du tout, c’est un nouveau cours de rythmique pour seniors ! Lancé en fin d’année dernière par le Conservatoire de musique neuchâtelois, ce dernier a remporté tant de succès qu’il a dû être immédiatement triplé à Neuchâtel et doublé à La Chaux-de-Fonds. Un engouement qui s’explique, entre autres, par la parution d’une nouvelle étude sur les bienfaits de la méthode Jaques-Dalcroze. Celle-ci, menée par le Département de réhabilitation et gériatrie des Hôpitaux universitaires de Genève et l’Institut Jaques-Dalcroze, souligne en effet que la rythmique permet de réduire de moitié les risques de chute pour les personnes âgées. La méthode a également un effet bénéfique sur l’orientation spatiale, la communication, la concentration, la mémoire, le sommeil et le moral.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">« La base de la rythmique pour les seniors reste la même que celle pour les enfants », explique Catherine Oppliger, enseignante au Conservatoire de musique neuchâtelois. « C’est la manière d’amener les exercices qui est différente, ainsi que la vitesse. Il y a aussi certaines limitations : alors que les enfants adorent les exercices à terre, on les évitera pour les personnes du troisième âge. Et on choisira d’autres musiques ! » L’élément musical est d’ailleurs primordial, puisque l’enseignante improvise ses airs au piano en les adaptant aux mouvements et aux rythmes du groupe.

Le roman original intitulé <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Les Yeux baissés</span> a été publié en janvier 1991 en France par l’écrivain marocain Tahar Ben Jelloun. La jeune fille raconte un souvenir d’enfance.</p><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">Mon père m’avait acheté un dictionnaire pour enfants. Ce fut mon premier cadeau. Un livre d’images où les mots étaient écrits en gros, expliqués et illustrés. J’apprenais des mots par cœur sans toujours les comprendre. Quand j’allais à la boulangerie, je ne montrais plus du doigt une baguette de pain, et je n’offrais plus ma main ouverte pleine de monnaie ; je disais comme tout le monde : « Deux baguettes bien cuites » ; j’ouvrais le porte-monnaie et je payais la somme exacte.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Je dormais souvent le dictionnaire sous l’oreiller. J’étais persuadée que les mots allaient, la nuit, le traverser et venir s’installer dans des cases prêtes pour le rangement. Les mots quitteraient ainsi les pages et viendraient s’imprimer dans ma tête. Je serais savante le jour où, dans le livre, il n’y aurait que des pages blanches. Tous les matins, je vérifiais l’état des choses. La première page dont j’avais avalé les mots était celle consacrée à la pierre. Je savais tout des pierres. Tout était enregistré dans ma tête. Je jubilais. C’était formidable. J’en traduisais quelques passages en berbère. La pierre m’obsédait et les mots qui la décrivaient m’enchantaient.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Une nuit, je supprimai l’oreiller et mis ma tête directement sur le livre magique. J’eus du mal à m’endormir. Ce n’était pas confortable. C’était peut-être à cause de ce manque de respect pour le livre que je fis un cauchemar.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Je me trouvais de nouveau au village, assise sous l’arbre, à garder les vaches. Tout d’un coup, je vis arriver vers moi des mots géants, tous armés de pelles. Ils marchaient en se dandinant. Ceux qui avaient aux pieds des<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> l</span> avançaient sans problème, mais ceux qui se terminaient par des <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">s</span> ou des <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">y</span>, avaient du mal à suivre le rythme de l’invasion. Le verbe « prendre » ramassait tout ce que j’avais appris sur la « pierre ». Il y eut une petite guerre brève mais efficace entre les mots français et les mots berbères.

Le roman original intitulé <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Les Yeux baissés</span> a été publié en janvier 1991 en France par l’écrivain marocain Tahar Ben Jelloun. La jeune fille raconte un souvenir d’enfance.</p><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">Mon père m’avait acheté un dictionnaire pour enfants. Ce fut mon premier cadeau. Un livre d’images où les mots étaient écrits en gros, expliqués et illustrés. J’apprenais des mots par cœur sans toujours les comprendre. Quand j’allais à la boulangerie, je ne montrais plus du doigt une baguette de pain, et je n’offrais plus ma main ouverte pleine de monnaie ; je disais comme tout le monde : « Deux baguettes bien cuites » ; j’ouvrais le porte-monnaie et je payais la somme exacte.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Je dormais souvent le dictionnaire sous l’oreiller. J’étais persuadée que les mots allaient, la nuit, le traverser et venir s’installer dans des cases prêtes pour le rangement. Les mots quitteraient ainsi les pages et viendraient s’imprimer dans ma tête. Je serais savante le jour où, dans le livre, il n’y aurait que des pages blanches. Tous les matins, je vérifiais l’état des choses. La première page dont j’avais avalé les mots était celle consacrée à la pierre. Je savais tout des pierres. Tout était enregistré dans ma tête. Je jubilais. C’était formidable. J’en traduisais quelques passages en berbère. La pierre m’obsédait et les mots qui la décrivaient m’enchantaient.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Une nuit, je supprimai l’oreiller et mis ma tête directement sur le livre magique. J’eus du mal à m’endormir. Ce n’était pas confortable. C’était peut-être à cause de ce manque de respect pour le livre que je fis un cauchemar.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Je me trouvais de nouveau au village, assise sous l’arbre, à garder les vaches.

L’article original a été publié le 13 novembre 2014 en Belgique par le journaliste et enseignant belge David D’Hondt.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose prose_type:news_article style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Vivre ensemble&nbsp;: Les 50 ans de l’immigration marocaine&nbsp;? «&nbsp;Je savais même pas&nbsp;»</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Lorsque nous avons demandé à des jeunes d’une école secondaire professionnelle de Molenbeek s’ils avaient participé aux activités de célébration des 50 ans de l’immigration marocaine, les réactions ont fusé. D’abord pour dire qu’ils n’étaient pas au courant que voilà 50 ans, les premiers Marocains arrivaient sur le territoire belge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">On entend souvent parler des jeunes d’origine marocaine. En réalité, que reste-t-il de «&nbsp;marocain&nbsp;» chez eux&nbsp;? L’identité multiple qui les habite montre que ce n’est qu’une partie de ce qu’ils sont. Une partie qui semble devenir de plus en plus petite, au profit d’autres éléments. Mais cette complexité identitaire est difficile à vivre pour les jeunes. Ils sont à la fois d’ici et de là-bas. Un là-bas qui fait parfois référence au pays d’origine, mais plus souvent à une région, ou un village d’origine. Ici, c’est la difficulté de vivre la culture occidentale et une certaine forme de religiosité à la fois. Difficulté d’être accepté par l’autre comme étant d’ici aussi.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Difficile aussi de discuter de l’histoire de l’immigration avec ces jeunes. Toutes nos questions sur le moment de leur arrivée en Europe, le chemin parcouru, les raisons du départ, la manière dont ils ont vécu ce moment, leurs rêves, sont restées sans réactions ou font l’objet de réponses approximatives et incertaines. Par contre, ils sont conscients du rêve de leurs parents pour eux, leurs enfants. «&nbsp;Leur sentiment est que leur famille s’est sacrifiée. Pour eux, leur père et leur mère ont dû assumer le coût du déracinement et de l’exil &nbsp;».</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En ce qui concerne l’héritage ouvrier des pères, la réponse doit être plus nuancée. D’une part, ils ont souvent mal connu leur père qui partait tôt le matin et revenait tard le soir fatigué. De quoi amener les jeunes et, souvent leurs parents, à refuser d’imaginer le même avenir. On voit du coup des élèves qui s’inscrivent dans les filières perçues comme «&nbsp;intellectuelles&nbsp;» de l’enseignement professionnel. La recherche d’une possible ascension sociale risque en fait de mener droit au statu quo. Ces filières de l’enseignement professionnel ne préparant pas réellement à un métier. Mais, d’autre part, l’héritage ouvrier des pères est souvent cité par les jeunes pour justifier leur place dans la ville. Ainsi, le rôle des parents dans la construction de la ville est mis en avant comme ayant permis à Bruxelles d’être la ville qu’elle est aujourd’hui. Soheib&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Sans nos parents, à Bruxelles il n’y aurait pas de routes et de rails de tram&nbsp;! C’est eux qui ont construit cette ville&nbsp;». Des propos qui permettent, comme l’explique le sociologue Didier Lapeyronnie, de légitimer la présence sur le sol du pays qu’ils habitent. Cela montre aussi qu’ils s’affirment comme étant d’ici. À partir du moment où l’on a construit cette ville, qui peut encore nous dire qu’on n’est pas d’ici&nbsp;?</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des raisons de l’immigration en Belgique.

Ainsi, le rôle des parents dans la construction de la ville est mis en avant comme ayant permis à Bruxelles d’être la ville qu’elle est aujourd’hui. Soheib&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Sans nos parents, à Bruxelles il n’y aurait pas de routes et de rails de tram&nbsp;! C’est eux qui ont construit cette ville&nbsp;». Des propos qui permettent, comme l’explique le sociologue Didier Lapeyronnie, de légitimer la présence sur le sol du pays qu’ils habitent. Cela montre aussi qu’ils s’affirment comme étant d’ici.

Mais elle n’est pas sans limites. Au Québec, on n’a pas le droit de critiquer son employeur ni ses activités. C’est contre l’obligation de loyauté prévue au Code civil. Si on a un profil Facebook, même privé, c’est considéré comme public, selon le Code civil.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Si les réseaux sociaux rapprochent les gens et permettent à tous le droit de parole publique, ils poussent les entreprises à revoir leur politique d’usage technologique. «&nbsp;Il y a deux ans, on a ajouté les mots ‘médias sociaux’ dans le code de conduite de l’entreprise&nbsp;», mentionne Isabelle Arthur, chef du service, relations avec les médias d'Air Canada. «&nbsp;On a communiqué avec nos 27 000 employés, tant les pilotes que le personnel de bureau et de maintenance, pour les informer que les réseaux sociaux sont maintenant inclus dans les médias traditionnels, d’une certaine façon.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">«&nbsp;Dans la dernière année, bon nombre d’entreprises ont été conscientisées&nbsp;», souligne Bruno Guglielminetti, directeur, communication numérique, du cabinet de relations publiques National. «&nbsp;Un peu comme à l’époque de l'arrivée des ordinateurs dans les lieux de travail, puis d’Internet, des portables et du téléphone cellulaire, les administrateurs ont dû encadrer leur utilisation. La différence avec les réseaux sociaux, c’est qu’on encadre le lien qui existe entre l’individu et l’entreprise.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">National dit être plus sollicité que jamais pour former employeurs et employés à cette nouvelle réalité. «&nbsp;Les formations ont doublé en deux ans&nbsp;», note Bruno Guglielminetti. «&nbsp;Tant chez les cabinets d’avocats que chez les banques et les compagnies d’assurances.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Mais malgré toutes les précautions prises, les entreprises doivent jauger, au cas par cas, ce qui relève du domaine privé et ce qui relève du domaine public. «&nbsp;Il y a des zones grises&nbsp;», concède Éloïse Gratton.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">© Isabelle Massé / La Presse</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit des employés qui se connectent à Internet au travail.

L’article original a été publié le 27&nbsp;septembre 2010 au Maroc par Jaouad Mdidech, journaliste à <span class=\"font_style:italic formatted_text\">La Vie éco</span>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Ils ont 35 ans et plus et vivent encore chez leurs parents</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Pas facile de quitter le nid familial quand on y est choyé et quand l’argent qu’on gagne ne profite qu’à celui qui l’engrange. À qui la faute&nbsp;? Aux enfants qui en profitent&nbsp;? Aux parents qui au fond d’eux-mêmes ont du mal à se séparer de leur progéniture&nbsp;? Ou à la société qui n’arrive pas à assurer le travail à ces millions de jeunes adultes pour qu’ils puissent avoir leur propre vie loin de leurs parents&nbsp;? La responsabilité est partagée, mais celle des parents qui n’ont pas su inculquer à leurs enfants le sens de l’indépendance est plus grande. Leur rôle est en effet de «&nbsp;faire en sorte que leurs enfants gagnent cette capacité à voler de leurs propres ailes. Toute personne adulte dispose en théorie de ce libre arbitre&nbsp;», estime Mohssine Benzakour, psychosociologue. Le grand désavantage de nos jeunes actuels, à la différence des générations précédentes, analyse Mohamed El Aouad, professeur de sociologie à la faculté de droit de Salé, est qu’«&nbsp;ils n’entrent pas de plain-pied dans la vie active juste après l’adolescence. La période des études devient très longue, la formation n’est pas adaptée au marché de l’emploi. Résultat&nbsp;: pas de travail, pas de logement et pas de mariage, les trois conditions essentielles pour accéder réellement à l’âge adulte&nbsp;».</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Ce sont donc des considérations financières, en premier lieu, qui entravent l’exercice de ce «&nbsp;libre arbitre&nbsp;» dont parle M. Benzakour. L’écrasante majorité des jeunes adultes qui continuent de vivre sous le toit de leurs parents le font par manque de moyens pour se payer leur propre logement. On pourrait même avancer que c’est la règle générale pour les adultes célibataires, pour les femmes en particulier, de continuer à partager le toit parental. Et leur nombre ne cesse d’augmenter. L’aspect financier est donc primordial, «&nbsp;le taux de chômage pour cette tranche d’âge est assez fort, le loyer est à des prix exorbitants, le pouvoir d’achat par rapport au coût de la vie est très inférieur&nbsp;», confirme M. Benzakour.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">L’allongement des études, la précarité économique et le chômage y sont pour beaucoup. Mais cela n’explique pas tout. Habiter avec ses parents à 30 et 40 ans, tant qu’on n’est pas marié, n’est pas stigmatisé outre mesure dans la société marocaine. Car «&nbsp;il y a l’idée persistante et qui trouve ses sources dans notre culture&nbsp;», enchaîne M. Benzakour. «&nbsp;Tant qu’on est célibataire, on n’a pas le droit de vivre séparé de ses parents.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">La raison économique et la raison culturelle ne sont pas seules à expliquer le prolongement de cette cohabitation des enfants adultes avec leurs parents. Il y en a qui travaillent, mais qui restent chez leurs parents n’osant pas franchir le pas. À cause d’un manque de confiance, mais aussi à cause de parents trop possessifs, estime M. Benzakour.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"multimedia_script\">\n<div class=\"scene\">\n<div class=\"displayed_content\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\">Dans cette sélection il s’agit de jeunes Suisses vivant toujours chez leurs parents à l’âge adulte.

L’article original a été publié le 8 avril 2015 en France par la journaliste française Dominique Nora.</p>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose prose_type:news_article style:1\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Les robots menacent-ils votre métier&nbsp;?</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Oui, on peut s’inquiéter pour les emplois de demain, mais les robots ne seront pas les seuls coupables du «&nbsp;chômage technologique&nbsp;» à venir. Loin de là. Le rapport Think Act du cabinet Roland Berger daté d’octobre 2014 recense les autres dangers qui menacent la prochaine décennie. En tête de liste viennent le «&nbsp;big data&nbsp;» et les systèmes d’intelligence artificielle, qui automatisent les fonctions de décision, grâce à l’analyse algorithmique des données massives. Ces logiciels ne remplaceront pas les bras, mais les cerveaux&nbsp;! Le système Watson d’IBM établit déjà des diagnostics en cancérologie. Et l’on voit se répandre les logiciels-traducteurs, les logiciels-journalistes, les logiciels-conseillers financiers. Il y a aussi les véhicules autonomes, qui se passeront des chauffeurs. L’Internet des objets sur lequel reposeront les chaînes logistiques et industrielles de demain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Plus généralement, il y a tout ce qui permet l’Internet mobile. Grâce à nos smartphones, de nouvelles plateformes de mise en relation peuvent en effet déstabiliser des industries entières, avec des investissements quasi nuls&nbsp;: ainsi, BlaBlaCar concurrence la SNCF, Airbnb l’hôtellerie traditionnelle, Uber les taxis ou Drivy les sociétés de location de voitures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Bien sûr, cette nouvelle société numérique et automatique créera aussi des emplois. Elle engendrera de nouveaux métiers (data scientist, bio-informaticien, etc.). Mais pour le moment, on a assisté aux États-Unis à une reprise pauvre en emplois.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Il est donc très difficile d’apprécier le résultat net de cette «&nbsp;destruction créatrice&nbsp;». Reste que, comme l’ont souligné les économistes Erik Brynjolfsson et Andrew McAfee au MIT (The Second Machine Age) ou Carl Benedikt Frey et Michael Osborne de l’Oxford Martin School, ce tsunami technologique, selon eux de «&nbsp;nature différente&nbsp;» des précédents, provoquera de tels gains de productivité qu’il affectera près de la moitié des emplois existants d’ici à deux décennies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En France, les projections de Roland Berger établissent que «&nbsp;42&nbsp;% des métiers présentent une probabilité d’automatisation forte à l’horizon de 20 ans&nbsp;». Certes, les métiers historiquement automatisables, comme ceux des ouvriers peu qualifiés, sont de plus en plus menacés. Mais le danger remonte la chaîne de valeur&nbsp;: des emplois qualifiés à fort contenu intellectuel sont maintenant concernés. Roland Berger le souligne&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Ce qui rend une tâche automatisable, à l’heure du numérique, c’est avant tout son caractère répétitif, qu’elle soit manuelle ou intellectuelle.&nbsp;»</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">D’où une menace sur des tâches qualifiées dans les métiers de la finance, du droit ou de la médecine. À l’inverse, les tâches préservées sont «&nbsp;celles qui requièrent créativité, sens artistique, intelligence sociale ou contact humain&nbsp;». Même si certaines d’entre elles ne demandent pas une grande qualification.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Source numéro 2</span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Introduction<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Dans cette sélection il s’agit des secteurs industriels qui utilisent la robotique.

Un aperçu</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Éducation artistique et compétences de réflexion et de créativité</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Tout le monde associe l’art à la créativité. Il existe quelques études faisant le lien entre une plus grande créativité et l’enseignement du théâtre et de la danse, mais le nombre limité d’études et la pertinence statistique des résultats positifs observés ne nous permettent pas de généraliser cette conclusion. Les recherches menées sur l’éducation artistique pluridisciplinaire n’ont pas clairement démontré un effet sur la créativité des élèves et leur capacité à résoudre un problème.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le manque de preuves scientifiques sur cette question peut s’expliquer par l’approche limitative généralement choisie pour mesurer la créativité&nbsp;: tests portant sur les compétences générales tels que les tests de créativité de Torrance (lors duquel les élèves doivent par exemple inventer des manières originales d’utiliser des objets de la vie de tous les jours ou donner un titre original à des images). Il existe une autre explication à cette absence de lien de causalité démontrée entre éducation artistique et créativité. En effet, une matière peut être enseignée de manière à stimuler la créativité et l’imagination ou au contraire de manière mortifère. Un cours de science (ou de toute autre matière) peut donc développer la créativité et l’imagination des élèves s’il est enseigné de manière adaptée et une discipline artistique peut n’avoir aucun impact sur la créativité et l’imagination si elle est mal enseignée. Il se peut également que les élèves ayant acquis un certain savoir-faire dans une discipline artistique développent des aptitudes créatives dans cette discipline mais que cette créativité nouvellement acquise ne se répercute pas sur d’autres domaines. Les études évaluant la créativité liée à un domaine spécifique restent encore à effectuer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Éducation artistique et compétences sociales et comportementales</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">L’éducation artistique est souvent perçue par les responsables politiques et les enseignants comme un moyen de faire aimer l’école aux élèves et de les inciter à s’investir davantage dans les matières classiques. Les études empiriques montrent que les élèves participant à des cours d’éducation artistique font preuve d’une attitude plus ambitieuse vis-à-vis de l’apprentissage scolaire et d’un niveau plus élevé de participation et de motivation. L’implication et la motivation se mesurent généralement par une meilleure assiduité à l’école, un taux de décrochage scolaire plus faible et certaines attitudes, comme la persévérance, le fait d’être «&nbsp;concentré sur sa tâche&nbsp;», de montrer de l’intérêt, etc. Il s’agit néanmoins d’études corrélationnelles qui ne permettent pas de conclure que c’est bien l’éducation artistique qui motive ainsi les élèves. D’éventuelles explications non causales existent néanmoins&nbsp;: il se peut par exemple que les élèves bénéficiant d’un enseignement artistique fréquentent des établissements scolaires d’un meilleur niveau général et où il est donc plus motivant d’étudier, ou que les élèves ayant volontairement opté pour une discipline artistique aient simplement été plus motivés dès le départ. La réalisation d’études expérimentales supplémentaires apparaît donc nécessaire.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Winner, E., T. Goldstein et S.

Le Conseil national a mis jeudi le texte sous toit en éliminant les divergences mineures qui subsistaient avec la version de la Chambre des cantons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Cette loi, qui doit remplacer plusieurs législations cantonales, s’applique aux sports à risque proposés à titre lucratif dans des sites montagneux et les cours d’eau. Y sont soumis les activités proposées par des guides de montagne ou des professeurs de sport de neige, ainsi que le canyonisme, le rafting et le saut à l’élastique.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Toutes ces personnes devront être titulaires d’une autorisation délivrée par le canton et valable sur tout le territoire suisse. Elles seront également tenues de contracter une assurance responsabilité civile professionnelle offrant une couverture adaptée aux risques.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Un processus de 10 ans</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le projet de législation nationale avait été lancé sous forme d’initiative parlementaire par Jean-Michel Cina (PDC/VS), alors conseiller national, après l’accident de canyonisme en 1999 dans le Saxetbach (BE). Depuis, la bataille sur la nécessité de légiférer ou non n’a cessé de rebondir.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Après le vote serré au National en septembre 2009 (83 voix contre 82), la commission du Conseil des États avait proposé au plénum, à l’instar du Conseil fédéral, d’enterrer le projet. Certains estimaient qu’il était né sous le coup de l’émotion suscitée par la tragédie du Saxetbach et que les cantons pouvaient légiférer eux-mêmes. Au plus près des réalités du terrain, sept cantons l’ont déjà fait.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Labels de sécurité en hausse</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">En outre, depuis l’accident survenu dans l’Oberland bernois, la branche s’est auto-régulée de manière satisfaisante en adoptant le label «&nbsp;Safety in adventures&nbsp;». Plus de 60&nbsp;% des entreprises proposant des activités à risque sont désormais certifiées. En juin, la majorité du Conseil des États avait toutefois estimé que les touristes qui viennent en Suisse doivent avoir les mêmes garanties en termes de sécurité dans tous les cantons. Ce sera donc désormais le cas.</p>\n<span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">ATS</span></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Source numéro 2 </span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span> Introduction <span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Dans cette sélection il s’agit des conditions requises pour pouvoir pratiquer des sports extrêmes.

La technologie de surveillance des enfants s’invite dans les foyers et suscite le débat&nbsp;: les parents vont-ils trop loin&nbsp;? Que disent ces nouveaux gadgets intrusifs sur les valeurs transmises aux enfants&nbsp;? Le point avec Syrine Slim, psychologue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Magicmaman&nbsp;:</span> Selon vous, l’apparition de nouvelles technologies visant à surveiller les enfants (type balise GPS, chaussettes 2.0, etc.) a-t-elle contribué à nourrir le besoin des parents de surprotéger leur progéniture&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Syrine Slim&nbsp;:</span> La question de la surprotection est loin d’être nouvelle&nbsp;: il y a toujours eu des parents qui couvent leurs enfants. La seule différence est qu’aujourd’hui, cette surveillance se fait selon de nouvelles modalités&nbsp;! Avant les parents interdisaient à leurs enfants de sortir, de téléphoner, d’aller dormir chez un ami, écoutaient leurs conversations téléphoniques et lisaient leur carnet intime... Aujourd’hui, les outils 2.0 de surveillance ont eu tendance à prendre le relais. Et à mes yeux, il ne faut pas s’étonner de cette nouveauté&nbsp;: aujourd’hui, l’enfant est surveillé avant même d’être né, via les échographies 3D (pas toujours nécessaires). Rien ne nous empêche de penser que dans 20 ans, les femmes enceintes pousseront la tendance encore plus loin. De plus, nous sommes dans un monde où tout le monde est observé tout le temps&nbsp;: au travail, dans la rue, sur Internet, etc. Les outils de surveillance des enfants participent à cette logique. Cette surveillance peut nous choquer parce qu’elle donne l’impression d’une intrusion parentale, mais la balise GPS intégrée au cartable de l’enfant ou le baby-phone ne sont que des moyens nouveaux, en phase avec leur temps, déployés dans le cadre d’un comportement qui a toujours existé !</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Magicmaman&nbsp;:</span> Si cette évolution est normale, le comportement des parents ne reste-t-il pas excessif&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Syrine Slim&nbsp;:</span> Je pense que la vraie question est ailleurs. Plutôt que de culpabiliser les parents sur des pratiques qui appartiennent à notre temps, il est nécessaire de nous interroger sur notre propre rapport à la connectivité. Aujourd’hui, il est quasiment impensable de sortir dans la rue, au restaurant ou bien même en forêt sans son portable&nbsp;! Mais avons-nous déjà vraiment pensé à ce que ce type de comportement transmet comme valeurs à nos petits, premiers témoins de l’utilisation à outrance des technologies&nbsp;? D’autre part, la surveillance exagérée des parents semble bien anodine face à l’exposition précoce des enfants aux informations.

Il y aura toujours des lecteurs de livres papier.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Le fait qu’il y ait des livres des livres numériques peut même augmenter le nombre de lecteurs, notamment les gens qui ne souhaitent pas se trimballer un gros bouquin. La manière de lire importe peu, ce qui importe c’est l’histoire. Il ne faut pas confondre le support et l’art. Il y a des livres que j’ai plus envie de lire sur papier et d’autres en numérique. Je lis actuellement Le Comte de Monte-Cristo d’Alexandre Dumas sur mon iPhone et parallèlement, je lis de la science-fiction sur papier. J’ai autant de plaisir à aller d’un endroit à l’autre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Atlantico :</span> Mais à l’heure de flux d’informations de plus en plus intenses, d’un environnement de formats écrits de plus en plus courts (comme Twitter), d’une attention du lecteur de plus en plus faible, l’écrivain doit-il modifier sa façon d’écrire&nbsp;?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Bernard Werber :</span> Je suis partisan des phrases courtes et des histoires claires, mais c’est un choix personnel. Je respecte ceux qui aiment les phrases longues et les histoires compliquées ce qui est d’ailleurs la mode actuellement en France.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Je ne pense pas que le livre numérique va introduire une écriture numérique. Par contre, je crois que le fait de circuler en métro donne un rythme&nbsp;: on lit un chapitre le temps d’un parcours. Le métro apporte donc beaucoup plus de raisons de changer le style d’un écrivain que le livre numérique. D’ailleurs, comme je passais l’essentiel de mon temps de lecteur dans le métro, j’ai eu envie d’aller vers le genre littéraire des nouvelles, plus adapté à notre époque de zapping.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">C’est le fait de zapper sur leur télécommande de télévision qui a fait que les gens ont eu envie de zapper les histoires ou les chapitres.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Aujourd’hui, le fait qu’il y ait des nouveaux outils va permettre d’augmenter le nombre de jeunes lecteurs. Cela va permettre également de dépoussiérer tout le milieu littéraire vieillot, fait de lourdeurs et de traditions datant de plusieurs siècles. Si on ne se modernise pas, et que nous ne réussissons pas ce virage vers les nouvelles, je crois que c’est la littérature anglo-saxonne qui va finir par nous abattre. Eux n’ont pas peur de ces formats rapides et d’une écriture rapide. La nouvelle c’est un art dans lequel on ne peut pas tricher. Si votre histoire n’est pas bonne on le voit tout de suite car elle est courte. C’est vraiment dommage que l’on méprise cette littérature en France car pour moi c’est la littérature d’avenir qui correspond aussi à l’outil numérique.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_block\"><span class=\"mandatory_credit_line\">Used by permission</span></span></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<p class=\"introduction passage-intro\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Source numéro 2</span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Introduction<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Dans cette sélection il s’agit de la popularité des livres numériques par rapport aux livres en papier.
