Both countries have the same amount of resources and can produce perfume and/or shoes. The production pos sibilities curves below show the combination of perfume and shoes that each country can produce.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a graph of two curves in the first quadrant of a plane. The origin is labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled “Shoes, in units,” and the numbers 2 and 5 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Perfume, in units,” and the number 50 is indicated. One curve represents Italy’s P P C, and the other curve represents France’s P P C. The curve that represents Italy’s P P C begins on the vertical axis at 50, and slants steeply downward and to the right in a straight line until it ends on the horizontal axis at 2.
