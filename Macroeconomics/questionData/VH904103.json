There is a straight line labeled, “Potential Real G D P” and a wave labeled, “Actual Real G D P”.  The straight line begins at the lower left side of the graph, on the vertical axis, and moves upward and to the right. The wave also begins on the vertical axis, below the straight line. It moves upward, and is above the Potential Real G D P line in 2009 and 2010, where it reaches a maximum. It then moves downward below the Potential Real G D P line and reaches a minimum in 2013. The wave then sharply moves upward, crossing the Potential Real G D P line in 2015, and reaching another maximum above the Potential Real G D P line around 2017.\" height=\"226\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH904103.g02.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The economy of Fisherland is at full employment for which year in the above diagram?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH904103_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">2009</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">2010</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">2013</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">2015</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">2017</p>"],"answer":3}]
