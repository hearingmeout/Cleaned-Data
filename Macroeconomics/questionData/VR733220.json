The horizontal axis is labeled “Unemployment Rate, in percent.” The vertical axis is labeled “Inflation Rate, in percent.” No numbers are indicated on either axis.

The L R P C sub 1 curve begins about halfway along the horizontal axis, and the L R P C sub 2 curve begins about one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis, parallel to the L R P C sub 1 curve.
