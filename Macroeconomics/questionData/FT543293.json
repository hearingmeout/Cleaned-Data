[{"id":"FT543293","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a graph with a horizontal axis labeled Consumer Goods and a vertical axis labeled Capital Goods. The graph contains three downward-sloping, left to right, curves that begin at different points on the top half of the vertical axis. The lines curve downward and end at different points on the right half of the horizontal axis. The curves are bowed out. The top, rightmost curve is labeled P P C sub zero, the middle curved line is labeled P P C sub 1, and the bottom, leftmost curved line is labeled P P C sub 2. The curved lines do not intersect each other. There are three data points on the graph. A data point on the P P C sub 1 curved line is approximately two thirds up the curved line, and is labeled X. A data point on the P P C sub 1 curved line is slightly less than halfway up the curved line and is labeled Y. Both X and Y are on the P P C sub 1 curve, and point Y is below and to the right of point X. The third data point, labeled Z, is between the P P C sub 1 and P P C sub 2 curves. Point Z is below points X and Y. Point Z is approximately one third above the horizontal axis, and rests slightly to the right of the P P C sub 2 curve.\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/ab529cb7dc4409f3fbc3f2689b6148f3/original.png\" width=\"294\"></p>\n\n<p>The diagram above shows three production possibilities curves (PPCs).
