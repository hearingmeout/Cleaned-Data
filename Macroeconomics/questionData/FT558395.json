This curve starts near the top and slightly to the right of the vertical axis,  and moves downward to the right and crosses the the vertival LRPC curve at a point labeled S. It ends slightly above the horizontal axis, far to the right of the vertical axis.  There is a point labeled R on the Short-Run Phillips Curve, to the left of the Long-Run Phillips Curve. \" height=\"301\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/5baa19126f203c647e59825219ebbd10/original.jpg\" width=\"365\">"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>An unanticipated increase in government spending</p>","<p>An unanticipated adverse supply shock</p>","<p>A decrease in net investment</p>","<p>An increase in real interest rates</p>","<p>An increase in the labor-force participation rate</p>"],"answer":-1}]
