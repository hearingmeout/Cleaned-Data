The horizontal axis is labeled “Time,” and the years 1 through 6, in increments of 1 year, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Economic Activity, in Real G D P.” The two curves in the graph are labeled Potential Real G D P and Actual Real G D P. The Potential Real G D P curve begins above the horizontal axis, and just to the right of the vertical axis, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line until it ends far to the right of year 6. The Actual Real G D P curve begins where the Potential Real G D P curve begins and moves generally upward and to the right in a wave-like pattern, crossing the Potential Real G D P curve several times. After beginning, the Actual Real G D P curve moves upward and to the right, and reaches a peak at year 1. It then moves downward and to the right, crossing the Potential Real G D P curve at year 2, and reaches a minimum at year 3. It moves back upward and to the right, crossing the Potential Real G D P curve at year 4, and reaches another maximum at year 5. It then moves back downward and to the right, crossing the Potential Real G D P curve at year 6, and reaches another trough to the right of year 6. The Actual Real G D P moves back upward and to the right, crossing the Potential Real G D P curve far to the right of year 6, and ending above the Potential Real G D P curve.
