The horizontal axis is labeled Real G D P, there are two points indicated along it. Point Y sub a is located approximately one quarter of the way across the horizontal axis, and point Y b is located nearly halfway across the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled Price Level, and there are two points indicated along it. Point P sub 1 is located slightly beneath the midway point of the vertical axis, and point P sub 2 is located slightly above point P sub 1. The three lines indicated in the graph are as follows. Line L R A S begins at point Y sub a on the horizontal axis and moves upward parallel to the vertical axis. Line A D begins near the top of the vertical axis, and moves downward at a constant rate, crossing line L R A S at the point with coordinates Y sub a and P sub 2. It continues downward and ends near the rightmost point on the horizontal axis. Line S R A S begins near the leftmost point on the horizontal axis and near the bottom of the vertical axis, and moves up and to the right at a constant rate, crossing line L R A S at point Y sub a. It continues to move up and it intersects line A D at the point with coordinates Y sub b and P sub 1, and ends near the rightmost point on the horizontal axis and near the top of the vertical axis.\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH925929.g01.png\" style=\"margin-left: 280px;\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The diagram above shows a nation’s short-run aggregate supply curve <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"S R A S \"><math alttext=\"S R A S \" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>SRAS</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext></mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, long-run aggregate supply curve <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"L R A S \"><math alttext=\"L R A S \" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>LRAS</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, and aggregate demand curve <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"A D \"><math alttext=\"A D \" overflow=\"scroll\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtext>AD</mtext><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.</p>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economy is operating at full employment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economy is operating below full employment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economy is operating above full employment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There will be downward pressure on the price level.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is a recessionary gap.</p>"],"answer":2}]
