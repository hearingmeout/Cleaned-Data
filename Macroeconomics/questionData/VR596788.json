The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity of Pounds.” The vertical axis is labeled dollars per pound, and the value 2 dollars per pound is indicated about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis.

The S curve begins on the vertical axis, just above the origin, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line until it ends just below the top of the vertical axis. The D curve begins on the vertical axis, just below dollars per pound, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the S curve about halfway along the horizontal axis, below the 2 dollars per pound mark. It continues downward until it ends on the horizontal axis, directly below the S curve.
