The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the numbers 0, 25, 30, 45, 60, and 65 are indicated. Vertical grid lines emanate upward from the numbers indicated on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Price,” and the prices $20, $30, and $40 are indicated. Horizontal grid lines emanate to the right from the prices indicated on the vertical axis. The two curves in the graph are labeled Supply and Demand. The Supply curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, below price $20, and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates 25 comma $20, 45 comma $30, and 65 comma $40, and ends far to the right of quantity 65, high above price $40. The Demand curve begins at a point that is about halfway between where the Supply curve begins and quantity 25, above price $40. It moves downward and to the right in a straight line, and passes through the point with coordinates 30 comma $40, intersects the Supply curve at the point with coordinates 45 comma $30, and then passes through the point with coordinates 60 comma $20. The Demand curve ends at a point about halfway between quantity 65 and where the Supply curve ends, below price $20.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR187454.g03.png\"></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the competitive market represented by the graph provided, which of the following is true at a price of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"$20\"><math alttext=\"$20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mo>$</mo><mn>20</mn></math></span></span> ?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR187454_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is a surplus of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"60\"><math alttext=\"60\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>60</mn></math></span></span> units.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is a surplus of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"35\"><math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>35</mn></math></span></span> units.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is a shortage of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"60\"><math alttext=\"60\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>60</mn></math></span></span> units.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is a shortage of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"35\"><math alttext=\"35\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>35</mn></math></span></span> units.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The quantity sold equals <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"60\"><math alttext=\"60\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>60</mn></math></span></span> units.</p>"],"answer":3}]
