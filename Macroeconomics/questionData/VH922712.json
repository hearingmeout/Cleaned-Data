The horizontal axis is labeled “Unemployment Rate,” and the numbers 0 through 7, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Inflation Rate,” and the numbers 0 through 10, in increments of 2, are indicated. There are several points on each curve. Note that all data are approximate. The short-run Phillips curve starts at point 1 comma 8, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the following 8 points: 1.5 comma 7; 2 comma 6; 2.5 comma 5; 3 comma 4; 3.5 comma 3; 4 comma 2; 4.5 comma 1; and 5 comma 0. The long-run Phillips curve starts at point 4 comma 8, and moves vertically downward in a straight line. It passes through the following 8 points: 4 comma 7; 4 comma 6; 4 comma 5; 4 comma 4; 4 comma 3; 4 comma 2; 4 comma 1; and 4 comma 0.
