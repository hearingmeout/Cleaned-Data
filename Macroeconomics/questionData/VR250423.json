The expected inflation rate is 9%, and the natural rate of unemployment is 12%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Based on the Phillips curve model, is the actual inflation rate greater than, less than, or equal to the expected inflation rate of 9% in Gabra? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Assume the government takes no policy action with regard to the state of Gabra’s economy.<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(i) What will happen to inflationary expectations in the long run?

Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Assume that instead of waiting for the long-run adjustment, the government of Gabra is considering using fiscal policy to address the recessionary gap of $60 billion.<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(i) If the government chooses to increase its deficit spending, calculate the minimum change in government spending required to increase aggregate demand by the amount of the recessionary gap. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work</span><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">.</span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(ii) How will the effect of the government’s action in part (c)(i) be represented in the Phillips curve model?
