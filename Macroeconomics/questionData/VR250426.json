The expected inflation rate is 3%, and the natural rate of unemployment is 3%.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Based on the Phillips curve model, is the actual inflation rate greater than, less than, or equal to the expected inflation rate of 3% in Gee? Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Assume the government takes no policy action with regard to the state of Gee’s economy.<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(i) What will happen to inflationary expectations in the long run?

Explain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(c) Assume that instead of waiting for the long-run adjustment, the government of Gee is considering using fiscal policy to address the inflationary gap of $50 billion.<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(i) If the government chooses to decrease its deficit spending, calculate the minimum change in government spending required to decrease aggregate demand by the amount of the inflationary gap. <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Show your work</span><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">.</span><span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(ii) How will the effect of the government’s action in part (c)(i) be represented in the Phillips curve model?

Based on loanable funds market analysis, what will happen to each of the following?<span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>(i) Real interest rates in Gee.
