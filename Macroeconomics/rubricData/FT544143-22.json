The second D sub R curve begins on the vertical axis, at the third grid line, and moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the initial D sub R curve, until it reaches the slanted portion of the initial D sub R curve. The second D sub R curve then moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line, such that part of its slanted portion overlaps the slanted portion of the initial D sub R curve. The second D sub R curve continues to move steeply downward and to the right until it reaches the first grid line at P R sub 2. The second D sub R curve then moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the initial D sub R curve, and intersects the S sub R curve. The second D sub R curve ends near the end of the horizontal axis, directly below where the initial D sub R curve ends. Three arrows are drawn on the graph. The first arrow is drawn to the right of the vertical axis, between the first and second grid lines, and points vertically downward, from P R sub 1 to P R sub 2. The second arrow is drawn to the right of the vertical axis, between the third and fourth grid lines, and points vertically downward, from the initial D sub R curve to the second D sub R curve. The third arrow is drawn to the right of the S sub R curve, between the first and second grid lines, and points vertically downward, from the initial D sub R curve to the second D sub R curve.\"></p><p>One point is earned for drawing a correctly labeled reserve market graph with the supply curve intersecting the demand curve in the range of ample reserves.</p><p>One point is earned for showing a decrease in the administered interest rates, resulting in a decrease in the policy rate.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points"],"values":[0,1,2],"maxScores":[2,2,2],"descriptions":["<p><strong>No points earned.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/c76d847fa46f629603861e1d2734aaae/original.png?Signature=Ld39OigyW9P68uMbTPFJ4%2BApYkk%3D&amp;Expires=1665751874&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKQO3P4E2F&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEO3//////////wEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD%2BfrSF/1VdaycF7LqrDCCqAGgl8sJi96Tp6l1tpEDm8wIhAMkjg35rw8y1s/SXUO8k4rpQav3nRmfXLRG9cZ2FxJlaKtUECLX//////////wEQAxoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1IgzPSZXQA0AS/4wwRvYqqQSpGt234rduNWIplWH45V0hcp%2BIZfEmWYoZKL5hO7hKztf9Fa/L%2BYiHj/mnIr0%2B9%2BLuP7oVCy6OpriznRP31YyYEJ9GeYUoR2Smdh%2B8BdWpeoJP62PgaV/UUqB2KeBNoFD7L22%2B9H7q5TE2xnIE0x03Axu/vqfOZXFY0yPfJHYS1GHV34kE4kK0LButFY1v4hF4NVmjQHH9RH7VItZEkxPF9sWyrBst4iJNH0w748yiVHMBqnvpQ8AlxjK2tfGGuaVh5nQkDVrybGwNlm/0eLxmd%2BgM2EamBVVIfDm21Fuq7iwMkYgV%2BLvVRIcnC79tHjx4aRP1n79FqnYrXmRimrBZti01lFDzu3o8jzj/K9HlD%2B0e3lyeBdhsiLnugasjb6LzOW/fgRK3mxrxz90B%2BYPvSHfaJ8uFQpZdHOR0KUD0Oaii0YyBbCvZCk9s8v3Ikr1n3LwGllCgLXX7L3E8YFwhzUDphb6zV6E7bjFkGR/2xJSVV63HvsN1Fg6RMZEnxWHt5STbkf/t2THE9IOTZvn7ZPVZfxvelI83fetB5IG0cf1BMZK%2B9AkyHlwRsLrP5SPDBX1a50Mw5Uo5fivf0E96BtMx6yC18xsuXApa6V%2BW8iNltrn2gH/HjhNegE0i8zsWqau1/fDXAVYCWrpBxG5UQRzM3ZBpN9ZpUTHzcG6J3rowleg6siiv4gvQ8v2NiZE3ELpHtSj/atdcWoe7ArD9zi%2BzYBzHXrgoMKvBo5oGOqgBCzlSFicvdC9mzfpbAwy5RZDQph78O2l9qQXTosTzofKR2uozLZNRMNFMEfZMzqqdPsoxwkrgrsJVPD6hraej5bwOraWcIgFMiv9gjsh4IhJkyxVwtQF0VSO7%2BY%2BKEFXRlv79iwvbYvYN0UCzSG4Stk/BL9f%2B5KqRq9AuALy/HhrDux5r0gMhpIPauVS9UuJHTB32QDrq5PdOzNFKlu864Tz9sufduI02\" alt=\"The figure shows a graph of two curves in a coordinate plane.

The D sub R curve is comprised of two identical curves that partially overlap each other. The initial D sub R curve begins on the vertical axis, at the fourth grid line, and moves horizontally to the right until it reaches a point about one fifth of the way along the horizontal axis. It then moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line until it reaches P R sub 1, about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. The initial D sub R curve then moves horizontally to the right, intersects the S sub R curve, and ends near the end of the horizontal axis. The second D sub R curve begins on the vertical axis, at the third grid line, and moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the initial D sub R curve, until it reaches the slanted portion of the initial D sub R curve. The second D sub R curve then moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line, such that part of its slanted portion overlaps the slanted portion of the initial D sub R curve. The second D sub R curve continues to move steeply downward and to the right until it reaches the first grid line at P R sub 2. The second D sub R curve then moves horizontally to the right, parallel to the initial D sub R curve, and intersects the S sub R curve. The second D sub R curve ends near the end of the horizontal axis, directly below where the initial D sub R curve ends. Three arrows are drawn on the graph. The first arrow is drawn to the right of the vertical axis, between the first and second grid lines, and points vertically downward, from P R sub 1 to P R sub 2. The second arrow is drawn to the right of the vertical axis, between the third and fourth grid lines, and points vertically downward, from the initial D sub R curve to the second D sub R curve. The third arrow is drawn to the right of the S sub R curve, between the first and second grid lines, and points vertically downward, from the initial D sub R curve to the second D sub R curve.\"></p><p>One point is earned for drawing a correctly labeled reserve market graph with the supply curve intersecting the demand curve in the range of ample reserves.</p><p>One point is earned for showing a decrease in the administered interest rates, resulting in a decrease in the policy rate.</p>","<p><strong>Earns 1 of 2 points.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/c76d847fa46f629603861e1d2734aaae/original.png?Signature=lQwoz8UvfvWrrk8BK95ZCnzASrI%3D&amp;Expires=1665751874&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKTSCBC7PV&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEOz//////////wEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDpYX5NH4zHpgvURTwdBFORn5Qz3ThZNCXhoqOIW7TGQQIgLDKBAOjwetj9sMezK2fjAMZ5Y4KZlRdllcAedb0DVogq1QQItf//////////ARADGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDBxR9KHV9DiEOzt0piqpBEXA0XPQFxOMnzRzZ57PkI51aUzwumUXe3nNVG49XbRiTyqB1YDILN2RGAA/6Kldjr3NGww8uxA%2B5zQ/uVI3UwEFMSLBUkYmAgvCmZGFIOoWdupjq6x0w0%2BU%2B9kSq1pmYDNKJcZblAZqw5UzV/1Mowie3aw6Znw%2BexQsCm9bMEsJSdF7ranLhLh%2BZ1uhp6/rNsIMKx3S5y/p0yy8EQEy1iFky/RzEkalVac8WcbzChiMgp/MMEs9XJtB8Z2PdCcmf9bAliVzBcXd3qDWomfn4CXap0Fr6djJzmfhLC4WVQFE5YdsGivJU8j8Zj0mXVUpiL2QxJVnED2uvYFphRmXXhtebAyLqUeGIk4a7EACK9%2B987ZK%2Bq%2B4J6ld/Po6VP3qjXszYwC2o4b44jL5ZxmsITNzZf36ZcZm1gCms0eBaQCpZpTgOHHEdnQWro783ZzvjzOdIA%2BEJShgIs7iS6qp722SOT8t3UWEBm2FSD5V9cA7VECiNDt6yicdxGj1PmVHQhsDd9gYJ9VrY7VEx8Z8Nvut82J4Vo1ckae0Y0uEA/oQgt8OYnZc3e7PnfOgp%2Bz2WuvToBpIIWyLRNKqgI0kmL/pljSrgMCpxgqHN4J2tcqMx8oG2XlXKDwkzZxZAFJB9CwgNGf90ceH/vZvo1O8JIfKq8%2BGs7cb5p6QKOOBdo7UKF45ToZe4QEPNgK15C2DAf/I7aopaVGR/frrrK3RWqBZeKvqraS0ccYwnLKjmgY6qQE0Waj083eIyidhbSK0epexi6INFHWa1GYlvMhQiva8XBjnaUptGt/mw18tRz9Gx1rk3eDNFoluvieqkyp1NDp0NWLkWNJ2cBpnRG/%2B6C%2Bd%2BW3y5Ox8gaYVH2uIZfLmRKInNvPmxWKGuAZjXkoNJKSDaiBcSfgd/UX4KuDweHH3Bc2gMIPkd19iZVcoFJDS276oy/u%2B%2BQ74Ujv2FpPpAjrq%2B7lX/aRiB0cx\" alt=\"The figure shows a graph of two curves in a coordinate plane.
