A small object, represented by the thick arrow, is held on the left side of each lens. The ray diagrams show the formation of the resulting image, represented by the thin arrow, for each lens.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows ray diagrams of three lenses labeled Lens 1, Lens 2, and Lens 3. A horizontal dashed line passes through the center of each lens. A thick arrow is to the left of each lens and represents a small object set on the horizontal axis. Two rays are drawn from the top of each object through the upper and lower portions of the lens to an image indicated at a point to the right of the lens and below the horizontal axis. In each diagram, an upper ray goes horizontally to the right to the top of the lens then goes downward and to the right through the horizontal axis while a lower ray goes downward and to the right through the horizontal axis to the lower part of the lens and then goes horizontally to the right. The ray diagram for lens 1 shows the lower ray moving at a moderate downward slope to strike the lens at the middle of the lower half of the lens while the upper ray moves at a moderate downward slope after striking the upper lens, and the image is created at a point halfway along the right half of the horizontal axis and halfway between the center and the bottom edge of the lens. The image is inverted and smaller than the object. The ray diagram for lens 2 shows the lower ray moving at a gentle downward slope to strike the lens just slightly below its center while the upper ray moves at a steep downward slope after striking the upper lens, and the image is created at a point just slightly to the right of the lens and just slightly below the horizontal axis. The image is inverted and much smaller than the object. The ray diagram for lens 3 shows the lower ray moving at a steep downward slope to strike the lens just slightly above its bottom edge while the upper ray moves at a gentle downward slope after striking the upper lens, and the image is created at a point near the end of the horizontal axis and far below the horizontal axis. The image is inverted and larger than the object.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR871954.g01.svg\" /></div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n sub 1 equals, n sub 2, which equals n sub 3\"><math alttext=\"n sub 1 equals, n sub 2, which equals n sub 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mstyle></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n sub 2 is greater than n sub 1, which is greater than n sub 3\"><math alttext=\"n sub 2 is greater than n sub 1, which is greater than n sub 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n sub 3 is greater than n sub 1, which is greater than n sub 2\"><math alttext=\"n sub 3 is greater than n sub 1, which is greater than n sub 2\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n sub 3 is greater than n sub 2, which is greater than n sub 1\"><math alttext=\"n sub 3 is greater than n sub 2, which is greater than n sub 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":1}]
