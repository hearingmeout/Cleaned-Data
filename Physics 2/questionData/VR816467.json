The horizontal axis is labeled “Speed,” and the numbers 0 through 1600, in increments of 200, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Probability per Unit Speed,” and the numbers 0.0000 through 0.0045, in increments of 0.0005, are indicated. Each curve begins at the origin, moves upward and to the right to its peak, and then moves downward and to the right. Each curve becomes almost horizontal and approaches the horizontal axis as speed becomes larger. Curve A reaches its peak at the point with approximate coordinates 200 comma 0.0041. It becomes almost horizontal after passing approximate speed 600. Curve B reaches its peak at the point with approximate coordinates 400 comma 0.0024. It becomes almost horizontal after passing approximate speed 1000. Curve C reaches its peak at the point with approximate coordinates 600 comma 0.0016.
