They place an object at various distances from the mirror and then move a screen until they see a focused image of the object on a screen. The students measure the distances of the object and the image from the mirror. A graph of the data is shown.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows the graph of several data points fit by a curve in a gridded plane with the origin labeled O. The horizontal axis is labeled Object Distance, in centimeters, and the numbers 5 through 35, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Image Distance, in centimeters, and the numbers 20 through 120, in increments of 20, are indicated. The curve begins at coordinates 11 comma 110 and moves downward and to the right, steeply at first and then more gradually. The curve passes through coordinates 13 comma 60, 15 comma 30, 20 comma 20, and then ends at coordinates 30 comma 18.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR871936.g01.svg\" /></div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10 centimeters\"><math alttext=\"10 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi>cm</mi></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"15 centimeters\"><math alttext=\"15 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>15</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi>cm</mi></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"20 centimeters\"><math alttext=\"20 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>20</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi>cm</mi></math></span></span></p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"30 centimeters\"><math alttext=\"30 centimeters\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>30</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\"></mspace><mi>cm</mi></math></span></span></p>"],"answer":0}]
