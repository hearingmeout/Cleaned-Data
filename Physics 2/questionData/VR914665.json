Moving from left to right, the horizontal line is structured as follows. The horizontal line begins as a thick dashed line that moves to the right for a short distance. The thick dashed line turns into a thick solid line, which moves to the right for a distance about four times the distance as the thick dashed line. The wave pulse travels in the middle portion of the thick solid line. The thick solid line turns into a thin solid line, which moves to the right for a distance about the same as the distance as the thick solid line. The thin solid line turns into a thin dashed line, which moves to the right for a distance about the same as the distance as the thick dashed line.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR914665.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Two different uniform strings are attached to each other, as shown in the figure. The strings are made of the same material, and the string on the left has a thicker diameter than the string on the right. A wave pulse in the left string has an upward displacement and is traveling to the right, as indicated, toward the attachment point between the two strings. After the pulse reaches the point of attachment between the strings, there is both a reflected pulse in the thick string and a transmitted pulse in the thin string. Which of the following correctly identifies both the displacement direction for the reflected pulse as well as the pulse that has a faster wave speed?</p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup align:center cols:3 colsep:0 frame:none rowsep:0\"><col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col1 colnum:1 colsep:1 colwidth:30\"/><col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col2 colnum:2 colwidth:110\"/><col class=\"colspec align:center colname:col3 colnum:3 colwidth:110\"/><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row rowsep:1\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\"></th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Reflected Wave <span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Pulse Displacement</th><th class=\"entry colname:col3\">Pulse with Faster <span class=\"formatted_line_break delivery_mode:Both\"></span>Wave Speed</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody valign:middle\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">A</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Remains upward</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Transmitted pulse</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">B</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Remains upward</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Reflected pulse</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">C</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Inverts to be downward</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Transmitted pulse</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">D</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Inverts to be downward</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Reflected pulse</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR914665_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":0}]
