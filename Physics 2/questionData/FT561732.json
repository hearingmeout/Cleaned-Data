[{"id":"FT561732","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"A hydrogen atom is isolated in a vacuum chamber. The electron is now separated from the proton and moved to a distance 1 cm away. Let <em>F<sub>G</sub></em> be the magnitude of the gravitational force between the proton and electron, and let <em>F<sub>E</sub></em> be the magnitude of the electric force between the proton and electron. How does the ratio F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> change as the particles are separated?","choicesHtml":["<p>F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> does not change; it is the same nonzero value for all separations.</p>","<p>F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> becomes larger as the particles are moved apart.</p>","<p>F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> becomes smaller as the particles are moved apart.</p>","<p>F<sub>G</sub> /F<sub>E</sub> cannot be evaluated; it is undefined for all separations.</p>"],"answer":-1}]
