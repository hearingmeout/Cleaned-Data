The vertical axis is labeled Current, in amperes, and the numbers 0.2 through 1.8, in increments of 0.2, are indicated. The 5 points are listed as follows. Note that all values are approximate.  Point 1. 1 resistor, 1.75 amperes. Point 2. 2 resistors, 1.0 ampere. Point 3. 3 resistors, 0.7 amperes. Point 4. 4 resistors, 0.58 amperes.

The box represents the component. The student starts with one resistor in the circuit, then adds one resistor at a time in series, recording the current in the circuit each time. The graph shows the student’s data. The student then does a best-fit curve to the data. How can the curve be used to determine the resistance of the component?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH912384_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Determine the value that the curve approaches for very large numbers of resistors.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Determine the area under the curve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Determine the value of current for zero resistors and divide the battery potential by that value.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Determine the slope of the curve at zero resistors and multiply the battery potential by that value.</p>"],"answer":2}]
