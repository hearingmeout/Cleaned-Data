Both ends of the string are in a fixed position at the same height as each other. The horizontal distance between the two ends of the string is labeled L. The string is represented by a solid curve. The wave is represented by a dashed curve. The string trends horizontally from left to the right in a wave-like pattern. It reaches a peak one eighth of the way along distance L, reaches a trough three eighths of the way along distance L, reaches a second peak five eighths of the way along distance L, and reaches a second trough seven eighths of the way along distance L. The wave begins where the string begins and trends horizontally from left to the right in a wave-like pattern. It reaches a trough one eighth of the way along distance L, reaches a peak three eighths of the way along distance L, reaches a second trough five eighths of the way along distance L, and reaches a second peak seven eighths of the way along distance L. The wave ends where the string ends. Each peak and trough of the string and the wave are the same vertical distance from each other. A note below the figure states that the figure is not drawn to scale.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR914689.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows a standing wave on a string that is fixed at both ends.
