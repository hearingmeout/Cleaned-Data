There are 4 arrows, labeled A, through D, between the levels. From left to right, the arrows are as follows. Arrow A begins at level E sub 1, and extends vertically upward to level E sub 2. Arrow B begins at level E sub 1, and extends vertically upward, passes through level E sub 2, and continues to level E sub 3.
