There is one tick mark just to the right of the intersection of the axes labeled V sub zero, and there are 2 evenly spaced vertical gridlines along the horizontal axis labeled from left to right as 5 V sub zero and 10 V sub zero. There are 4 evenly spaced horizontal gridlines along the vertical axis labeled from bottom to top as P sub zero, 2 P sub zero, 3 P sub zero, and 4 P sub zero. There is a closed figure that has four straight lines. A line is drawn from point A, at coordinates 5 V sub zero comma P sub zero, to point B, at coordinates V sub zero comma 4 P sub zero. There is a horizontal line from point B to point C, that has coordinates 5 V sub zero comma 4 P sub zero. There is a line from point C to point D, that has coordinates 10 V sub zero comma 2 P sub zero. There is a line from point D back to point A, completing the figure. \" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/87292fc3a7dededa2cd94156730f1a7c/original.png\" width=\"325\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a laboratory experiment, students recorded the pressure and volume of a sample of ideal gas as its temperature was varied.
