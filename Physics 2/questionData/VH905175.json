An unlabeled dot is drawn on the line, a little to the left of this arrow. To the right of the lens, a thick downward pointing arrow, labeled “image,” is drawn on the line, such that the bottom of the arrow is on the line. There are two rays drawn between the object and the image.  One ray starts at the tip of the object, moves horizontally to the right, bends in the lens, then moves downward and to the right, until it hits the tip of the image. The second ray starts at the tip of the object, moves downward and to the right, straight through the midpoint of the lens and to the tip of the image.\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH905175.g04.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows a ray diagram for an object near a lens.
