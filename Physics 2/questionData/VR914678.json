Which of the following justifications supports the student’s claim with correct physics principles?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR914678_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Space is polarized. Light waves can be polarized as they are transverse waves, but sound waves cannot be polarized as they are longitudinal waves.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Light waves contain magnetic fields like those generated by the Sun. Sound waves get distorted by large magnetic fields meaning they cannot propagate in space.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Space is a near vacuum. Light waves are electromagnetic, which do not need a medium to propagate, but sound waves are mechanical and require a medium to propagate.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Space increases the wavelength of sound and light waves. The increase in the wavelength of light does not cause it to fall outside the visible spectrum but the increase in the wavelength of sound causes sound waves to be outside the range of human hearing.</p>"],"answer":2}]
