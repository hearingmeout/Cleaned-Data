A current is also indicated on the circuit. The left side contains a battery. Below the battery is a resistor labeled 5 ohms. Above the battery, is an upward pointing current labeled 0.5 amp. Moving up the left side and across the top, the circuit splits into two vertical branches. The first vertical branch has an open switch labeled S, a capacitor labeled 5 microfarads, and a resistor labeled 10 ohms.
