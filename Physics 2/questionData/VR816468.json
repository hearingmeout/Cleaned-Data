The horizontal axis is labeled “Speed, in meters per second,” and the numbers 0 through 1400, in increments of 200, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Number of Atoms per Unit Speed,” and no numbers are indicated. Each curve begins at the origin, moves upward and to the right to its peak, and then moves downward and to the right. Each curve becomes almost horizontal and approaches the horizontal axis as speed becomes larger. The Sample X curve reaches its peak at approximate speed 300 meters per second, and becomes almost horizontal after passing approximate speed 800 meters per second. The sample Y curve reaches its peak at approximate speed 600 meters per second, which is approximately half as high as the peak of the sample X curve.
