[{"id":"VR816517","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A cold metal sphere is placed inside a box with room-temperature air. The box and sphere are then isolated from their surroundings. Over time, condensation begins to form on the metal sphere as water vapor in the air becomes liquid water droplets on the surface of the sphere. This causes the entropy of the water molecules inside the box to decrease. Which of the following correctly indicates whether the entropy of the entire system consisting of the air and the sphere increases or decreases, and provides a valid justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR816517_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increases, because the total energy of the system increases</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increases, because the overall increase in the entropy of the metal sphere is greater in magnitude than the decrease in entropy of the water molecules</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreases, because the total energy of the system decreases</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Decreases, because the overall increase in the entropy of the metal sphere is less in magnitude than the decrease in entropy of the water molecules</p>"],"answer":1}]
