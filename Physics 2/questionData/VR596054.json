The spacing between the equipotential lines increases from left to right. Starting from the left, each equipotential line curves a bit downward to the right before curving upward and to the right until the equipotential line is nearly vertical. Four data points labeled W, X, Y, and Z are also indicated throughout the figure. Starting at the equipotential line in the left most region of space the equipotential line has a value of negative 20 volts. As one moves to the right across the figure, each subsequent equipotential line increases in size and the number of volts increases in increments of 10. The location of the data points are as follows. Data point W is located on the equipotential line with a value of negative 10 values. Data point X is in the region between the equipotential lines with values of 10 and 20 volts. Data point Y is located between the equipotential lines with values of 20 and 30 volts.
