The bottom side of the circuit has a resistor labeled capital R and the current is labeled 2 point 0 amps and is flowing leftward. The second circuit, labeled &quot;Figure 2,&quot; has 2 batteries and 3 resistors. The top side of the circuit has, from left to right, a 6 point 0 volt battery, a resistor labeled lowercase r, another 6 point 0 volt battery, and another resistor labeled lowercase r.
