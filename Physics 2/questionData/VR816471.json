Each curve begins at the origin, moves upward and to the right to its peak, and then moves downward and to the right. Each curve becomes almost horizontal and approaches the horizontal axis as speed becomes larger. Curve A has its peak at the point with approximate coordinates 400 comma 0.002, and becomes almost horizontal after passing approximate speed 1,000.
