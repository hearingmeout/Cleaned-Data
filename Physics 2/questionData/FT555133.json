The film has an index of refraction <em>n<sub>f</sub></em> = 1.38. White light is incident normal to the surface of the film as shown below. It is observed that at a point where the light is incident on the film, light reflected from the surface appears green (λ = 525 <em>nm</em>).</p><p><img alt=\"The figure shows three horizontal lines representing the interfaces between materials.The top line is the interface between air and a film, having air with refractive index n sub a equals 1.00 above and a film with refractive index n sub f equals 1.38 below.
