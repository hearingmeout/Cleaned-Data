Particles move in semicircular paths through one region, then cross a gap between the semicircles where there is an electric field oriented such that the particles accelerate, increasing their speed through the gap. The particles continue to move from one region to the other, speeding up each time they pass through the gap and moving through each region in a semicircular path with a larger radius each time. Which of the following correctly compares the magnitude of the magnetic force exerted on the particles and the length of time it takes a particle to complete a half circle as the particle spirals outward through the cyclotron?</p><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup align:center cols:3 colsep:0 frame:none rowsep:0\"><col class=\"colspec colname:col1 colnum:1 colsep:1\"/><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row rowsep:1\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\"></th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\">Magnitude of the magnetic force</th><th class=\"entry colname:col3\">Period of orbit</th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">A</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Decreases</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Increases</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">B</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Remains the Same</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Remains the Same</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">C</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Increases</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Remains the Same</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\">D</td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Increases</td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">Decreases</td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR817511_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":2}]
