It consists of two parallel conducting plates, with charges on the plates as indicated creating an electric field of magnitude E directed toward the top of the page. A uniform magnetic field of magnitude <em>B<sub>1</sub></em> directed out of the page exists between the plates. The magnitude of the magnetic field can be adjusted so that only particles of a particular speed pass through the selector in a straight line. A radioactive source to the left of the selector emits charged particles, each having the same charge <em>+q</em> and moving to the right in the plane of the page.
