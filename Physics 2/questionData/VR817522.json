There is a magnetic field throughout the tank directed into the page, and a current is produced through the water by an external battery, as shown. As the ions move due to the potential difference across the tank produced by the battery, the ions experience a magnetic force. Which of the following correctly compares the directions of the magnetic forces exerted on the positively and negatively charged ions and provides a correct justification?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR817522_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Opposite directions, because positively charged ions will follow magnetic field lines, while negatively charged ions will move in the opposite direction.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Opposite directions, because each set of charged ions produce their own magnetic fields as they move, interacting in opposite ways with the magnetic field.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The same direction, because they move in opposite directions due to the potential difference, but the right-hand rule is reversed on oppositely charged ions, so they experience a magnetic force in the same direction.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The same direction, because the magnetic force is larger on the positive ions, and their mutual attraction will pull the negative ions with them.</p>"],"answer":2}]
