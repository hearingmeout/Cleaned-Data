The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in seconds,” with tick marks every second and the numbers 2 through 8, in increments of 2, labeled. The vertical axis is labeled “Electric Field, in volts per meter,” and the numbers negative 3 through 3, in increments of 1, are indicated. The wave begins at approximately 0 seconds, 3 volts per meter and ends at approximately 8.75 seconds, 0 volts per meter. The wave has a maximum displacement at the following three approximate points: A wave trough at 2.5 seconds, comma negative 3 volts per meter. A wave peak at 5 seconds, comma 3 volts per meter. A wave trough at 7.5 seconds, comma negative 3 volts per meter. The wave has zero displacement at the following three approximate points: 1.25 seconds, 0 volts per meter. 3.75 seconds, 0 volts per meter. 6.25 seconds, 0 volts per meter.\" height=\"145\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/28edf14c22f2a6f7365ae007686d29d5/original.png\" width=\"310\" /></p>\n\n<p>The graph above represents the magnitude<em> E</em> of the electric field at a point in space as a function of time<em> t</em>.
