The vertical axis is labeled “Temperature,” and no values are indicated. Eleven horizontal grid lines are drawn above the horizontal axis, at equal intervals. The curve begins approximately halfway up the vertical axis, and moves upward and to the right until it reaches a maximum at the eleventh gridline, a distance of 50 centimeters from the mirror. It then moves downward and to the right until it begins to level off at the first gridline, a distance of 180 centimeters from the mirror. At this point, the graph continues horizontally to the right until the end of the graph.\" height=\"189\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR025001.g03.png\" width=\"415\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">i.
