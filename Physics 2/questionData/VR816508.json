The horizontal axis is labeled delta uppercase T, in kelvins, and the values 0 through 150, in increments of 25, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled the fraction Q over delta lowercase t, in joules per second, and the values 0 through 20, in increments of 10, are indicated. The best-fit line begins at the point with coordinates 42 comma 7 and moves upward and to the right to the point with coordinates 134 comma 23. The coordinates of the data points are as follows. A point at 50 comma 9 is slightly above the best-fit line. A point at 75 comma 13 is on the best-fit line. A point at 100 comma 18 is slightly above the best-fit line. A point at 125 comma 21 is slightly below the best-fit line.
