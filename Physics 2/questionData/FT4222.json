They connect a capacitor with plate area <em>A</em> to a battery and allow it to become fully charged. They take measurements that they believe will allow them to calculate the charge <em>q</em> on one plate of the capacitor. The students then repeat the procedure with other capacitors. The capacitors each have a different plate area but are otherwise identical. The students plot the calculated charge <em>q</em> as a function of plate area <em>A</em>. Their results, including a best fit to the data, are represented above. Is this graph a reasonably accurate representation of the relationship between <em>q</em> and <em>A</em>?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>Yes, because the relationship should result in a graph that is curved and decreasing.</p>","<p>No, because the relationship should result in a graph that is linear and decreasing.</p>","<p>No, because the relationship should result in a graph that is linear and increasing.</p>","<p>No, because the relationship should result in a graph that is curved and increasing.</p>"],"answer":1}]
