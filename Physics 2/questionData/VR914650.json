[{"id":"VR914650","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A wave generator can produce wave pulses of different amplitudes on a string that has a fixed amount of tension. A student claims that increasing the amplitude of the wave pulses will cause the speed at which the pulses propagate along the string to increase. Is the student’s claim correct? Why or why not?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR914650_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. Increasing the amplitude of a wave pulse increases the energy carried by the pulse.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes. Increasing the amplitude of a wave pulse causes points on the string to move a greater distance in the same amount of time.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. The speed at which a wave pulse propagates along a string is independent of the amplitude of the wave.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No. The speed at which a wave pulse propagates along a string is inversely related to the amplitude of the wave.</p>"],"answer":2}]
