The bottom corners of the glass are circular arcs, with the bottom right arc centered at point <em>O</em>. A monochromatic light source placed to the right of point <em>P</em> shines a beam aimed at point <em>O</em> at an angle of incidence <em>θ</em>. The flat bottom surface of the glass containing point <em>P</em> is frosted so that bright spots appear where light from the beam strikes the bottom surface and does not reflect. When θ=θ<sub>1</sub>, two bright spots appear on the bottom surface of the glass. The spot closer to point <em>P</em> will be referred to as <em>X</em>; the spot farther from <em>P</em> will be referred to as <em>Y</em>. The location of spot <em>X</em> and that of spot <em>Y</em> both change as <em>θ</em> is increased.</p>\n\n<p>(a) In a coherent paragraph-length answer, describe the processes involved in the formation of spots <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> when <em>θ</em> = <em>θ<sub>1</sub></em> .
