A light ray traveling to the right is incident on the upper left side of the circle. The incident ray makes an angle theta with a dashed line drawn radially from the center of the circle and passing through the point of incidence. Three rays are shown extending into the circle from the point of incidence. One continues horizontally in the same direction as the incident ray, one travels in a straight path angled above the horizontal ray, and one travels in a straight path angled below the horizontal ray. The ray that passed into the circle horizontally also passes out horizontally, and this ray is labelled C. The ray that was above the horizontal ray splits into two rays upon leaving the circle. One ray is angled up more than the ray inside the circle, and this is labelled A. The other ray is angled down from the ray inside the circle, and this is labelled B. The ray that was below the horizontal ray splits into two rays upon leaving the circle. One ray is angled down more than the ray inside the circle, and this is labelled E.
