The figure on the right presents a graph in the coordinate plane, with the origin labeled “O.” The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in seconds,” with tick marks every second and the numbers 2 through 6, in increments of 2, labeled. The vertical axis is labeled “Magnetic Field, in Teslas,” with tick marks every 0.5 tesla and the numbers 1.0 through 4.0, in increments of 1.0, labeled. The graph consists of 4 connected line segments. The first line segment begins at 0 seconds, 3.5 Teslas, and moves horizontally to the right until it reaches 2 seconds, 3.5 Teslas. The second line segment moves steeply downward and to the right until it reaches 4 seconds, 0.5 Teslas. The third line segment moves horizontally to the right until it reaches 6 seconds, 0.5 Teslas. The fourth line segment moves upward and to the right until it ends at 7 seconds, 1.5 Teslas.\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/33b86da663da1cb25deafb4e44819492/original.png\" width=\"750\" /></p>\n\n<p>A circuit containing only a lightbulb is placed in a uniform magnetic field \\(\\overrightarrow{B}\\)&nbsp;directed into the page, as shown above on the left.
