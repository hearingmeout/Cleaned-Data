The vertical lines are the boundaries between the substances. The region on the left is substance 1 with refractive index n sub 1. The middle region is substance 2 with refractive index n sub 2. The region on the right is substance 3 with refractive index n sub 3. A light ray is shown traveling up and to the right in substance 1. When the ray passes into substance 2 it continues moving up and to the right, but the line is more horizontal than it was in substance 1. In region 3 the light ray returns to traveling in the same direction as it travelled in substance 1. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/0aa54fe115af04d95380ab68fa025ea9/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p>A light ray passes through substances 1, 2, and 3, as shown above.
