The screen is represented by a thick, horizontal line at the top of the diagram. At the bottom of the diagram, the slit is represented by the space between two solid rectangles, which are parallel to the screen.  Point X is near the left side of the slit, and Point Y is near the right side of the slit. Two sets of alternating solid and dashed circular arcs are drawn, one set centered on X and the other set centered on Y. Four other points, A, B, C, and D are shown. Point A is above X, at a spot where a dashed arc from X and a dashed arc from Y intersect. Point B is above A, at a spot where a dashed arc from X and a solid arc from Y intersect. Point C is above B and on the screen, at a spot where a solid arc from X and a dashed arc from Y intersect. Point D is above Y and on the screen, at a spot where a dashed arc from X and a solid arc from Y intersect.\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR002355.g02.png\" width=\"355\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Light incident on a single slit forms an interference pattern on a distant screen.
