A wave pulse initially moves to the right along the string. A student claims that, after the pulse reaches the point of attachment between the string and rope, there will be two pulses present. Is the student’s claim correct? What reasoning supports or refutes the student’s claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR914669_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, the claim is correct. A wave pulse incident on a boundary between two mediums will result in both a reflected and a transmitted wave or wave pulse.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, the claim is correct. A wave pulse traveling from one medium to another becomes two pulses within the second medium, traveling at different speeds.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, the claim is not correct. A wave pulse in a medium remains a single pulse unless additional energy is transferred to the medium from the outside environment.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, the claim is not correct. A wave pulse traveling at the wave speed in a medium can only travel in a medium having the same wave speed.</p>"],"answer":0}]
