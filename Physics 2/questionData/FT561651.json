The diagram has four levels, and four transitions, which are represented by downward pointing arrows labeled A, through D. The top level is labeled negative 2 point 0 electron volts. The second level is labeled negative 4 point 0 electron volts. The third level is labeled negative 5 point 0 electron volts. The fourth level is labeled negative 10 point 0 electron volts. Arrow A points from the top level to the second level (negative 2 point 0 electron volts to negative 4 point 0 electron volts). Arrow C points from the second to the third level (negative 4 point 0 electron volts to negative 5 point 0 electron volts). Arrow D points from the second to the fourth level (negative 4 point 0 electron volts to negative 10 point 0 electron volts). Arrow B points from the third to the fourth level (negative 5 point 0 electron volts to negative 10 point 0 electron volts).\" height=\"171\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/715c563cd8b0a8fec54e1dc72854af5d/original.png\" width=\"290\" /></p>\n\n<p>The energy level diagram for a hypothetical atom is shown in the figure above.
