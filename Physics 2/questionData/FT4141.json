Above the shield is a horizontal wire with an arrow labeled I in the middle of the wire and pointing to the right. Path 1 is a vertical line below the opening in the shield. It curves to the left just above the opening and then curves downward until it meets the shield at a location to the left of the opening. Path 2 is the same vertical line as path 1 below the opening in the shield. It curves to the left less sharply than path 1 above the opening and finally curves slightly downward. Path 2 comes closer to the wire than path 1.

The scientist lets a beam of the particles, all with the same speed, pass through an opening in a shield and enter the field created by a wire carrying a constant current. Paths 1 and 2 represent the observed paths of the particles. Based on the paths, which of the following could be the types of particles?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 1 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 2 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Electron</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Alpha</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 1 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 2 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Alpha</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Electron</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 1 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 2 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Positron</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Alpha</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 1 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Path 2 Particle</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Alpha</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">Positron</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":1}]
