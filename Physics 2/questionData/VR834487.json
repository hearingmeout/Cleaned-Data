An insulating rod with a positive charge is held near the sphere. A student makes the following incorrect claim:</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">“Since the sphere is a solid conductor and has zero net charge, it must be electrically neutral everywhere throughout its interior as well as everywhere on its surface.”</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following explains why the student’s claim is incorrect?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR834487_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If the sphere were neutral everywhere, it would have an electric field inside it due to the charge on the rod.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If the sphere were neutral everywhere, there would have to be a conductive path between the sphere and ground.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If the sphere were neutral everywhere, the net force on the sphere would be zero and the sphere would float in mid-air.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">If the sphere were neutral everywhere, the stand would have to acquire a negative charge to balance the positive charge of the rod.</p>"],"answer":0}]
