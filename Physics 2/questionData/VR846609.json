Each circuit diagram has a battery, an open switch, a resistor, and a capacitor. The left vertical branches have an open switch. The right vertical branches have a capacitor with capacitance C sub 0. The bottom horizontal branches have a battery. The top horizontal branches have the resistor. The first circuit is labeled Circuit X. In it, the battery has potential difference delta V sub X, and the resistor has resistance R sub X. The second circuit is labeled Circuit Y. In it, the battery has potential difference delta V sub Y, and the resistor has resistance R sub Y. The graph is described as follows. The horizontal axis is labeled “t,” and the number 0 is indicated along it. The vertical axis is labeled “Capacitor Charge, in microcoulombs,” and the numbers 0 through 12, in increments of 2, are indicated. The two curves are labeled Circuit X and Circuit Y. Circuit X begins at the origin, moves to the right and upward rapidly at first and then more gradually, and becomes horizontal approximately one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis at 12 microcoulombs. Circuit Y begins at the origin, moves to the right and upward rapidly at first and then more gradually, and becomes horizontal approximately near the end of the horizontal axis at 8 microcoulombs.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR846609.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"X\"><math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math></span></span> and Circuit <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Y\"><math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math></span></span>, shown in the figure, have identical capacitors but different resistors and batteries.
