A pulse generator and a block are connected by a string that passes over the pulley. The pulse generator is on top of the table toward the left edge. The left end of the string is attached to the right side of the pulse generator. The pulse generator moves up and down and creates a wave pulse that moves to the right along the horizontal string. The string then passes over a pulley on the right edge of the table and connects to the block that is suspended vertically. The horizontal length from the center of the top of the pulse generator to the center point of the pulley is indicated.

The pulse generator can create wave pulses that travel along the horizontal length of the string.
