The index of refraction <em>n<sub>P</sub></em> of the plastic is known. The hollow space is filled with a gas, and the students are asked to collect the data needed to find the index of refraction <em>n<sub>G</sub></em> of the gas. The arrow represents a light beam that they shine into the plastic. They take the following set of measurements:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows a table with three rows of data. Row 1 states 'Angle of incidence of the light in the air above the plastic block' with a measurement of 30 degrees. Row 2 states 'Angle of refraction of the beam as it enters the plastic from the air' with a measurement of 45 degrees. Row 3 states 'Angle of refraction of the beam as it enters the plastic from the gas' with a measurement of 45 degrees. \" height=\"76\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/3f10d29770ca98fd2dfe0d12306f3f9e/original.png\" width=\"685\" /></p>\n\n<p>The three measurements are shared with a second lab group. Can the second group determine a value of <em>n<sub>G</sub></em> from only this data?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>Yes, because they have information about the beam in air and in the plastic above the gas.</p>","<p>Yes, because they have information about the beam on both sides of the gas.</p>","<p>No, because they need additional information to determine the angle of the beam in the gas.</p>","<p>No, because they do not have multiple data points to analyze.</p>"],"answer":1}]
