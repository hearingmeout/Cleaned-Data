From top to bottom, the four diagrams are labeled Setup A, Setup B, Setup C, and Setup D. Each setup shows a taut string whose left end is attached to a machine. The machine oscillates up and down such that the string starts to move to the right in a wave like pattern. The string’s movement in each setup is as follows. In Setup A, the string forms two short pairs of a peak followed by a trough, which spans a short distance from the machine. In Setup B, the string forms a long peak followed by a long trough, which spans about halfway along the string. In Setup C, the string forms three medium length pairs of a peak followed by a trough, which spans about halfway along the string. In Setup D, the string forms two long pairs of a peak followed by a trough, which spans about three fourths of the way along the string.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR914657.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows four similar setups. In each setup, the left end of a taut string is attached to a machine that can oscillate up and down, and the machine’s oscillations cause a wave to propagate along the string. The mass per length is not necessarily the same for each string, and the right ends of the strings (not shown) are pulled with different amounts of constant tension.</p><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The machines are initially turned off, and then all turned on at time <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t equals 0\"><math alttext=\"t equals 0\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></math></span></span>.
