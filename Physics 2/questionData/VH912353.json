Classmates gave the student the above data that show the charge on the equivalent capacitance in a circuit as additional identical capacitors are added to the circuit, but the classmates did not indicate whether the capacitors were added in series or parallel. What evidence from the data can be used to determine whether the capacitors were added in series or parallel?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH912353_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The charge changes as capacitors are added.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The charge increases as capacitors are added.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The charge doubles as each additional capacitor is added.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The data does not provide any evidence about how the capacitors were added.</p>"],"answer":1}]
