The circuit is described as follows. The circuit has a battery and two resistors, labeled X and Y. The top left corner is labeled point a. The top right corner is labeled point b. The bottom right corner is labeled point c. The bottom left corner is labeled point d. The left vertical branch has the battery with its long terminal downward. The top horizontal branch has resistor X. The right vertical branch has resistor Y. The line graph is described as follows. The horizontal axis is labeled “Position,” and the four letters a, b, c, and d are indicated from left to right and evenly spaced. The vertical axis is labeled “Potential,” and is divided into three equal units. From left to right, the potentials are as follows for each of the four positions. At position a, potential is 0 units. At position b, potential is 2 units. At position c, potential is 3 units. At position d, potential is 3 units.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR846590.g01.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows a circuit comprised of a battery and two resistors, Resistor <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"X\"><math alttext=\"X\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">X</mi></math></span></span> and Resistor <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Y\"><math alttext=\"Y\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Y</mi></math></span></span>.
