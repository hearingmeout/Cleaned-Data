From left to right, the lines have values from negative 8 volts to positive 8 volts, in increments of 2 volts. Four points in the region are labeled A through D. The 0 volt line runs vertically through the middle of the rectangle, and the other lines curve downward and away from the middle of the rectangle so that they move further apart from each other as they move downward. Point A is near the top of top of the rectangular region between 0 and negative 2 volts. Point C is near the bottom of top of the rectangular region between 0 and negative 2 volts. Points A and C are at an equal distance from the 0 volt line, but point C is further away from the negative 2 volt line than point A since point C is lower than point A. Point B is located between positive 2 and 4 volts. Point D is located between negative 2 and 4 volts. Points B and D are at the same height so point B is at the same relative distance between positive 2 and 4 volts as point D is between negative 2 and 4 volts.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR871948.g01.svg\" /></div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">B</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">C</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">D</p>"],"answer":0}]
