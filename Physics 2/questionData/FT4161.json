Charge 1 is about one fourth of the way down from the top of the region and about one third of the away across from the left edge of the region. Charge 2 is about one fourth of the way down from the top of the region and about one fourth of the away across from the right edge of the region. Charge 3 is about one-third of the way up from the bottom of the region and about one-fourth of the away across from the right edge of the region. Charge 4 is about one-fifth of the way up from the bottom of the field and about one-fifth of the away across from the left edge of the field. The vectors point away from charge 1, away from charge 2, toward charge 3, and away from charge 4. There is space with no vectors around each of the charges. Charge 3 has very little space around it. Charge 2 has more space around it than charge 3. Charge 4 has about twice as much space as charge 2. Charge 1 has about three times as much space as charge 2. The vectors are longer when they are closer to charges and smaller away from charges. A point labeled P is a little to the left and above charge 4. The vertical distance from charge 4 to point P is about two times the horizontal distance between the two.\" maxwidth=\"400\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/64a35fceabf000e3a9a820d9be58e394/original.png\" width=\"400\"/></p><p>The figure above shows the electric field in a region surrounding four charged particles, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, that are held in place.
