The student then puts a second laser at the same location as the first and shines it at the diffraction grating. A new pattern of dots is observed on the wall behind the grating. The second laser emitted light of equal brightness, and shorter wavelength. How will the pattern of dots on the wall generated by the second laser compare to that generated by the first laser?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR002503_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The distance between adjacent dots would decrease.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The distance between adjacent dots would remain the same.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The distance between adjacent dots would increase.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The difference cannot be known without knowing the wavelengths of the light used.</p>"],"answer":0}]
