The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in seconds,” and the numbers 1 through 6, in increments of 1 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Position,” and no values are indicated along it. The wave begins at a peak along the vertical axis near its top. Another lower peak occurs at 0.5 seconds, five-sixths of the way up the vertical axis. Another lower peak occurs at 1 second, two-thirds of the way up the vertical axis. Another lower peak occurs at 1.5 seconds, halfway up the vertical axis. A higher peak occurs at 2 seconds, near the top of the vertical axis and at the same height as the first peak. Another lower peak occurs at 2.5 seconds, five-sixths of the way up the vertical axis. Another lower peak occurs at 3 seconds, two-thirds of the way up the vertical axis. Another lower peak occurs at 3.5 seconds, halfway up the vertical axis.
