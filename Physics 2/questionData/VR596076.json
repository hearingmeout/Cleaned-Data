The pressure of the gas is measured as its absolute temperature is increased. A graph of pressure measurements as a function of temperature is shown above. The sample of gas is transferred to a second container with half the volume of the first container, and the experiment is repeated. According to the ideal gas law, which of the following will be true of the best-fit line for the new data compared to the best-fit line for the data shown?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR596076_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The new line will be the same.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The new line will have the same temperature intercept but a smaller slope.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The new line will have the same temperature intercept but a larger slope.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The new line will have the same slope but will intercept the temperature axis at a different value.</p>"],"answer":2}]
