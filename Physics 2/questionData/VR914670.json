The strings are made of the same material, and the string on the right has a thicker diameter than the string on the left. The strings are pulled taut, and a periodic wave created at the left end (not shown) of the thin string travels to the right. What, if anything, happens to the frequency of the wave when it is transmitted into the thick string, and what evidence supports the claim?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR914670_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The frequency becomes lower in the thick string.
