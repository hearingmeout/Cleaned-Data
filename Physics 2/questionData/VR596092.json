The sound will be detected much later because sound propagates much slower than light for the entire distance from the Moon to Earth.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The light will be detected a very short time after the explosion. The sound will never be detected because sound waves cannot propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neither the light nor the sound will ever be detected because neither can propagate in the vacuum of space between the Moon and Earth.</p>"],"answer":2}]
