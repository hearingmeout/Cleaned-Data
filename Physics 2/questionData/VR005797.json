Light incident on a metal ejects electrons from the metal’s surface with a range of energies. The electrons hit the plate and a current is created in the circuit. The variable power supply is used to create a potential difference between the metal and the plate. There is a potential difference for which no electrons reach the plate and the current goes to zero. Which of the following justifies the use of this potential difference to determine the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR005797_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The potential difference changes the minimum amount of energy needed to release an electron from the material.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The potential difference changes the amount of energy imparted to the electrons by the incident light.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The gain in the electrons’ potential energy caused by the potential difference equals their loss in kinetic energy.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The gain in the electrons’ potential energy caused by the potential difference equals the energy of the photons of incident light.</p>"],"answer":2}]
