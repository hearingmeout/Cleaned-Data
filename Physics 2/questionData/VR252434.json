Cycle X is counterclockwise. The graph of Cycle X has the horizontal axis labeled V, and the values of V sub ref and 2 V sub ref are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled P, and the values of 3 P sub atmosphere and 6 P sub atmosphere are indicated. Three data points, labeled A through C, are shown in the cycle as follows. Point A is shown at the coordinates V sub ref comma 6 P sub atmosphere, and a diagonal process directed downwards and to the right goes from point A to point B which is located at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 3 P sub atmosphere. A vertical process then goes from point B upwards to point C, which is located at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 6 P sub atmosphere, after which the cycle returns horizontally left to point A. Cycle Y is clockwise. The graph of Cycle Y has the horizontal axis labeled V, and the values of V sub ref and 2 V sub ref are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled P, and the values of 2 P sub atmosphere and 6 P sub atmosphere are indicated. Three data points, labeled A, C, and D are shown in the cycle as follows. Point A is at the coordinates V sub ref comma 6 P sub atmosphere, and a horizontal process directed to the right goes from point A to point C which is located at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 6 P sub atmosphere.
