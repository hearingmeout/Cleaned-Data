Initially, the gold leaves of the electroscope are hanging vertically downward and touching. When a probe with an unknown charge is lowered into the middle of the can without touching the can, the gold leaves separate, as shown in the figure. The wire to the electroscope is then cut, and the electroscope is moved far away from the can. A second conducting probe with no net charge is then brought near the isolated electroscope, and the gold leaves are observed to be attracted to the probe. Are these observations sufficient to determine the sign of the charge on the first probe that was lowered into the can? Why or why not?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH965880_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the charged gold leaves will be attracted to the neutral conducting probe regardless of the sign of the charge on the first probe.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the neutral probe has an equal number of positive and negative charges and therefore it exerts no electric force on the gold leaves.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because negatively charged electrons are the only mobile charge carriers and therefore the gold leaves must be negatively charged.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because only electrons can be transferred and therefore electrons must have been transferred to the can by the first probe.</p>"],"answer":0}]
