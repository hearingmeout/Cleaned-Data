The particle with charge positive q is above the particle with charge positive 2 q. Circular equipotential lines for each positively charged particle are drawn around each particle, respectively. Larger round equipotential lines for both positively charged particles are drawn around both particles and outside the circular equipotential lines. In the diagram, the small negatively charge particle starts at the top left corner of the diagram, and moves toward the bottom of the page through a point, labeled A, that is directly to the left of the particle with charge positive q. It continues toward the bottom of the page and to the right through a point, labeled B, between the two positively charged particles, and reaches a point, labeled C, that is directly to the right of the particle with charge positive 2 q. The small particle then moves toward the bottom of the page and to the left below the particle with charge positive 2 q, and moves almost horizontally to the left through a point, labeled D, and ends at the bottom left of the diagram.\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR814822.g01.svg\" width=\"225\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure shows two positively charged particles, with charges <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"positive q\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"positive q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mpadded></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"positive 2 q\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"positive 2 q\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mpadded><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>q</mi></mpadded></math></span></span>.
