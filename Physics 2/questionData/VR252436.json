Both cycles are clockwise. The graph of Cycle 1 has the horizontal axis labeled V, and the values of V sub ref and 2 V sub ref are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled P, and the values of 2 P sub atmosphere and 8 P sub atmosphere are indicated. Three data points, labeled A through C, are shown in the cycle as follows. Point A is at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 8 P sub atmosphere, and a vertical process directed downward goes to point B which is located at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 2 P sub atmosphere. A horizontal process directed to the left goes from point B to point C, which is located at the coordinates V sub ref comma 2 P sub atmosphere, after which the cycle returns diagonally up and to the right to point A. The graph of Cycle 2 has the horizontal axis labeled V, and the values of V sub ref and 2 V sub ref are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled P, and the values of 4 P sub atmosphere and 8 P sub atmosphere are indicated. Three data points, labeled A, D, and E are shown in the cycle as follows. Point A is at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 8 P sub atmosphere, and a vertical process directed downward goes to point D, which is located at the coordinates 2 V sub ref comma 4 P sub atmosphere. A horizontal process to the left then goes to point E, which is located at the coordinates V sub ref comma 4 P sub atmosphere.
