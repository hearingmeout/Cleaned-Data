The figure shows part of the soap bubble, where a wave of visible light is incident on the top interface between air and the film of soapy water. The wave gets reflected at both the top interface and the bottom interface. For which interface, if either, is there a <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"180 degrees\"><math alttext=\"180 degrees\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>180</mn><mo>°</mo></math></span></span> phase change when the wave reflects?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR914723_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The top interface only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The bottom interface only</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both interfaces</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neither interface</p>"],"answer":0}]
