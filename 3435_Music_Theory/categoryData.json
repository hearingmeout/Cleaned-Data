Some features enliven rhythm by challenging the regularity of an established meter. For example, syncopation occurs when rhythm places accent on weak beats or divisions. A cross-rhythm (or polyrhythm) is a simultaneous occurrence of two or more rhythmic patterns that do not derive from one another and are not rooted in the same meter. Hemiola, in its most fundamental meaning, refers to any arrangement of rhythm and meter that articulates a 3 to 2 ratio. Thus, hemiola occurs when three notes of equal duration take up the time previously held by two notes of equal duration, or vice versa. Common manifestations of hemiola include the following- * Measures of compound duple meter (e.g., 6/8) juxtaposed with measures that articulate a simple triple meter (e.g., 3/4), with the division pulse remaining constant (e.g., a static eighth-note pulse). * Two measures of triple meter that are accented as Strong-weak-Strong-weak-Strong-weak instead of the usual Strong-weak-weak-Strong-weak-weak.","ch":[]},"368984":{"c":23322,"p":368982,"e":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.1","n":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.1","l":"RHY-3.A.2","d":"RHY-3.A.2: Other rhythmic devices include the following- * An agogic accent is a note that naturally receives more emphasis due to its extended (or longer) duration. * An anacrusis, or pickup, is a rhythm or rhythms that start before the first downbeat of a phrase. * A fermata is a symbol placed over a note or rest that indicates it is to be held longer than its normal duration.","ch":[]},"368985":{"c":23322,"p":368981,"e":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.1","n":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.1","l":"RHY-3.B","d":"RHY-3.B: Identify and apply procedures used to transform rhythmic patterns in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","ch":[368986]},"368986":{"c":23322,"p":368985,"e":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.1.0","n":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.1.0","l":"RHY-3.B.1","d":"RHY-3.B.1: Rhythmic patterns can be transformed.
