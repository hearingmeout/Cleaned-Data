Always begin with the regular scoring guide. Try an alternate scoring guide <em>only </em>if necessary. (See E below.)</p><p>A. Using the regular scoring guide, award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm. Note that:</p><p>· A “segment” is</p><p>o in simple duple or compound duple meter: any half measure of the original melody, even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse. (In common time or cut time, a segment is any set of two contiguous quarter-note beats; in compound duple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous eighth-note beats.)</p><p>o in simple triple meter: a full measure of the original melody, even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse. (In simple triple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous quarter-note beats.)</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p><p>· Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment <em>may </em>be metrically shifted from its original position.</p><p>· Give no credit for the final half note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p><p>B. If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 additional point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1 = 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the additional point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p>C. The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p><p>D. Record any score of 4 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p>E. If after applying A–C the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p>F. If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p>G. Scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</p><p>II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the additional point.)</p><p>A. Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>B. Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 points)</p><p>III.

The column on the left is labeled Egregious Errors. The column on the right is labeled Minor Errors with the subheading, two minor errors equal one egregious error. The following are the egregious errors listed in the left-side column: A.1. Parallel fifths or octaves, consecutive perfect fifths or octaves in contrary motion (marked on the second chord), Note: Perfect fifths to diminished fifths are OK, though some may create other problems with incorrect resolutions and/or chordal sevenths (marked on the second chord); A.2. Doubling the leading tone (marked on the first chord), unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone (marked on the first  chord), Note: A bass line that moves from scale degree one to seven to six is OK, i.e. not an unresolved leading tone; A.3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord), Note: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed; A.4. Unresolved seventh or incorrectly resolved seventh (marked on the first chord); A.5. Other note-against-note dissonance (including fourths) that is not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note (marked on the first chord); A.6. Poor chord succession (e.g.,  five to four, five to two, two to three, four to three, two to one, three to one, six to one, five to three, three to two, three to diminished seven, etc.) (marked on the second chord), Note: Motions from five or five-six to four-six are allowed.; A.7. Root-position leading-tone chord (diminished seven) followed by anything other than root-position I (marked on the first chord); A.8. Poor chord use, such as six-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three  sequence, modulation, or following a strong-beat one—i.e., a five-six motion); three-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence) (marked on the first chord); A.9. Inappropriate leap (seventh, augmented interval, or compound interval), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, descending leap of more than a third into a chordal seventh, or leap of an octave that does not change direction afterwards (marked on the last chord of the leap(s)), Note: Leaps of diminished intervals that change direction and resolve by step afterwards are allowed; A.10. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (not applicable to “Start Here” phrase); and A.11. Use of an unacceptable rhythmic value, including all rests. The following are the minor errors listed in the right-side column: B.1. Diminished fifth to perfect fifth (marked on the second chord); B.2. Approach to fifth or octave in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps (marked on the second chord); B.3. Metrically inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); B.4. Incomplete inverted seventh chord; B.5. Cross relation (marked on the first chord); B.6. Repeated note and/or Roman numeral (and inversion) from weak beat to strong beat, unless at start of phrase (marked on the second chord); B.7. Root-position diminished seven triad that moves directly to one (marked on the first chord); and B.8.

The following are the egregious errors listed in the left-side column: A.1. Parallel fifths or octaves, consecutive perfect fifths or octaves in contrary motion (marked on the second chord), Note: Perfect fifths to diminished fifths are OK, though some may create other problems with incorrect resolutions and/or chordal sevenths (marked on the second chord); A.2. Doubling the leading tone (marked on the first chord), unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone (marked on the first  chord), Note: A bass line that moves from scale degree one to seven to six is OK, i.e. not an unresolved leading tone; A.3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord), Note: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed; A.4. Unresolved seventh or incorrectly resolved seventh (marked on the first chord); A.5. Other note-against-note dissonance (including fourths) that is not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note (marked on the first chord); A.6. Poor chord succession (e.g.,  five to four, five to two, two to three, four to three, two to one, three to one, six to one, five to three, three to two, three to diminished seven, etc.) (marked on the second chord), Note: Motions from five or five-six to four-six are allowed.; A.7. Root-position leading-tone chord (diminished seven) followed by anything other than root-position I (marked on the first chord); A.8. Poor chord use, such as six-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three  sequence, modulation, or following a strong-beat one—i.e., a five-six motion); three-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence) (marked on the first chord); A.9. Inappropriate leap (seventh, augmented interval, or compound interval), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, descending leap of more than a third into a chordal seventh, or leap of an octave that does not change direction afterwards (marked on the last chord of the leap(s)), Note: Leaps of diminished intervals that change direction and resolve by step afterwards are allowed; A.10. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (not applicable to “Start Here” phrase); and A.11. Use of an unacceptable rhythmic value, including all rests. The following are the minor errors listed in the right-side column: B.1. Diminished fifth to perfect fifth (marked on the second chord); B.2. Approach to fifth or octave in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps (marked on the second chord); B.3. Metrically inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); B.4. Incomplete inverted seventh chord; B.5. Cross relation (marked on the first chord); B.6. Repeated note and/or Roman numeral (and inversion) from weak beat to strong beat, unless at start of phrase (marked on the second chord); B.7. Root-position diminished seven triad that moves directly to one (marked on the first chord); and B.8.

The column on the left is labeled Egregious Errors. The column on the right is labeled Minor Errors.  The following are the egregious errors listed in the left-side column: A.1. Parallel fifths or octaves, consecutive perfect fifths or octaves in contrary motion (marked on the second chord); A.2. Doubling the leading tone (marked on the first chord), unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone (marked on the first chord); A.3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); A.4. Unresolved seventh or incorrectly resolved seventh (marked on the first chord); A.5. Other note-against-note dissonance (including fourths) that is not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note (marked on the first chord); A.6. Poor chord succession (e.g., five to four, five to three, five to two, two to three, four to three, two to one, three to one, six to one, three to two, three to diminished seven, etc.) (marked on the second chord); A.7. Root-position leading-tone chord (diminished seven) followed by anything other than root-position I (marked on the first chord); A.8. Poor chord use, such as six-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence, modulation, or following a strong-beat one—i.e., a five-six motion); three-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence) (marked on the first chord); A.9. Inappropriate leap (seventh, augmented interval, or compound interval), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, descending leap of more than a third into a chordal seventh, or leap of an octave that does not change direction afterwards (marked on the last chord of the leap(s)); A.10. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (applicable to only phrases three and four); and A.11. Use of an unacceptable rhythmic value, including any rests. The following are the minor errors listed in the right-side column: B.1. Diminished fifth to perfect fifth (marked on the second chord); B.4. Approach to fifth or octave in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps (marked on the second chord); B.3. Metrically inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); B.8. Incomplete inverted seventh chord; B.5. Cross relation (marked on the first chord); B.2. Repeated note and/or Roman numeral (and inversion) from weak beat to strong beat, unless at start of phrase (marked on the second chord); B.6.
