In measure 2 there is a quarter rest on beat one in both the cello and viola. The cello then plays dotted quarter A-sharp 2 and eighth B2. The viola plays dotted quarter C-double-sharp 3 and eighth D-sharp 3. In measures 4 through 7, the viola plays dotted quarter C-double-sharp 3, eighth notes D-sharp 3, A-sharp 3, G-sharp 3, C-sharp 4, B4, dotted quarter A4, eighth notes F-sharp 4, E4, C4, dotted quarter B3, eighth A-sharp 3, and quarter C-sharp 4. In measures 11 through 14, Violin one plays dotted quarter C-double-sharp 4, eighth notes D-sharp 4, A-sharp 4, A-natural 4, D5, C6, dotted quarter B-flat 5, eighth notes G5, F-sharp 5, D5, dotted quarter C-sharp 5, eighth B-sharp 4, and quarter E-sharp 5. In measures 4 through 20, the tempo marking is “poco a poco accelerando al” and then “Allegretto” (with the quarter note equal to 138 beats per minute) in measure 21. In measures 20 through 25, Violin one plays a repeated pattern of eighth notes, pitches D5, C-sharp 5, E-sharp 4, and F-sharp 4. In measures 26-28 the pitches of the repeated eighth note pattern change to D5, C-natural 5, F-sharp 4, and G4. In measures 22 through 28, Violin two plays a descending melody that begins half note A5 tied to dotted eighth A5, sixteenth G-sharp 5, and quarter D-sharp 5. The viola simultaneously plays a melody with a contour similar to Violin two. In measures 4 through 7, the viola and cello play a melodic idea that is answered by a shorter idea in Violin 1 and 2 in measures 8 and 9. In measures 11 through 14, violin 1 and 2 play a melodic idea similar to the viola and cello melody in measures 4 through 7. They are answered by the viola and cello in measures 15 and 16, who are playing similar material to violins 1 and 2 in measures 8 and 9.
