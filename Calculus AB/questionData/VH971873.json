The figure also presents a secant line connecting the endpoints of the curve that intersects the curve at three additional points. No numbers are indicated on either axis. The curve begins at the point with coordinates 1 comma f of 1, which is above the x axis and just to the right of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, until it reaches a local maximum high above the x axis. It then moves downward and to the right, until it reaches a local minimum approximately one third of the way along the x axis, above the x axis, but below where the curve began. It then moves upward and to the right, until it reaches a local minimum approximately two thirds of the way along the x axis. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches a local minimum just above the x axis. The curve then moves upward and to the right briefly until it ends at the point with coordinates 8 comma f of 8, which is above the x axis, and far to the right of the y axis. The secant line begins at the point with coordinates 1 comma f of 1, and slants downward and to the right. It passes through the curve on either side of the local minimum that is approximately one third of the way along the x axis, and it passes through the curve on either side of the local maximum that is approximately two thirds of the way along the x axis. The line continues downward and to the right, until it ends at the point with coordinates 8 comma f of 8.\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH971873.g09.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The figure above shows the graph of the differentiable function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></math></span></span> for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1 less than or equal to x, less than or equal to 8\"><math alttext=\"1 less than or equal to x, less than or equal to 8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>≤</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and the secant line through the points <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"with coordinates 1 comma f of 1\"><math alttext=\"with coordinates 1 comma f of 1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"coordinates 8 comma f of 8\"><math alttext=\"coordinates 8 comma f of 8\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
