All three graphs lie above the x-axis in the first quadrant. Graph I: This graph is increasing and concave down from (0,2) to (3,4).  It then is decreasing and concave down until it passes through an open circle at (4,3), at which point it continues to decrease, but switches to concave up.  A closed point exists at (4,4). At (5,3), the graph begins to increase, remaining concave up.  Graph II: This graph is increasing and concave down from (0,3) to (3,5).
