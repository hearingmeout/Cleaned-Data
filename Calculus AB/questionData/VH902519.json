The horizontal axis is labeled “t,” and the numbers 2 through 12, in increments of 2, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “x of t,” and the numbers 10 through 60, in increments of 10, are indicated. The graph consists of 3 line segments. The first line segment begins on the vertical axis at 10, and moves upward and to the right. It passes through the points with coordinates 2 comma 20, and 4 comma 30, and ends at the point with coordinates 6 comma 40. The second line segment begins where the first line segment ends, and moves horizontally to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 8 comma 40, and ends at the point with coordinates 10 comma 40.
