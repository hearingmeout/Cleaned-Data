The horizontal axis is labeled x, the vertical axis is labeled y, and the origin is labeled O. There are 6 tick marks on the x-axis, from left to right, they are labeled 1, r, t, u, w, and 5. From left to right, the graph starts in the fourth quadrat, at a point with x-coordinate 1. The graph moves down until it reaches a point with x-coordinate r. The graph then moves up, passing through the x-axis at t, and continues on to pass through a point with x-coordinate u. The curve then moves down, passing through a point with x-coordinate w and approximately the same y-coordinate as the previous point, and ends at a point with x-coordinate 5. \" height=\"753\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/6048276fc0258c621844ce7bf460fbe7/original.png\" width=\"200\" /></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows the graph of the differentiable function <em>f</em> for <span aria-label=\"1 is less than or equal to x comma x is less than or equal to 5\"><math> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> <mo>≤</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>≤</mo> <mn>5</mn> </mrow> </math></span>.
