The numbers 1 and 2 are indicated along the x axis. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are indicated along the y axis. One curve begins in quadrant 2, and moves downward and to the right. It crosses the y axis at the point with coordinates 0 comma 4, and continues downward. It begins to level off as it approaches the x axis and reaches a minimum on the x axis at the point with coordinates 2 comma 0. It then moves upward and to the right before ending in quadrant 1. The other curve also begins in quadrant 2, but below the first curve. It moves almost horizontally to the right, and crosses the y axis at the point with coordinates 0 comma 4, intersecting with the first curve. The curve then moves gradually downward and to the right at first before moving steeply downward and to the right, crossing the x axis, and intersecting the first curve again, at the point with coordinates 2 comma 0. It continues downward until it ends in quadrant 4.
