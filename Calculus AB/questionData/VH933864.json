The curve consists of six loops, which are situated in three pairs. The first pair of loops begins on the y axis, just above the origin. The first loop is situated entirely in quadrant 1, and the second loop is situated across quadrants 1 and 4. The pair of loops ends in quadrant 4, just below the x axis, and to the right of the y axis. The second pair of loops begins where the first pair of loops ends. The third loop is situated in quadrant 4, and the fourth loop is situated in quadrant 3, such that the place where the third and fourth loops touch is on the y axis, below the origin. The pair of loops ends in quadrant 3, just below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. The third pair of loops begins where the second pair of loops ends. The fifth loop is situated across quadrants 3 and 2, and the sixth loop is situated entirely in quadrant 2.
