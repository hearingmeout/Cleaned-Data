The numbers negative 1 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 2 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of two line segments. An open circle and a closed circled circle are included in the graph. The first line segment begins to the left of the y axis at y equals 2. It moves horizontally to the right, crossing the y axis at 2, and ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 2. Directly below this open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1. The second line segment begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 2, and moves upward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 3 comma 3, and the point with coordinates 4 comma 4, before it ends.\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH934740.g06.png\" width=\"295\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
