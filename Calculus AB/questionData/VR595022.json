The horizontal axis is labeled “Time, in seconds,” and the numbers 15 and 30 are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled “Height, in feet,” and the number 40 is indicated. Four points are indicated along the curve. The curve begins on the vertical axis, just above the origin, and is nearly level. It then moves upward and to the right, passes through point A, which has approximate coordinates 2 comma 3. The curve continues upward and to the right, gradually becoming steeper until it passes through point B, which has approximate coordinates 8 comma 20, and gradually becomes less steep until it reaches a maximum at point C, which has coordinates 15 comma 40. The curve then moves downward and to the right, passes through point D, which has approximate coordinates 16 comma 38, and continues downward steeply and to the right until it begins to level off and ends at 30 seconds, just above the horizontal axis.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR595022.g04.svg\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An amusement park ride reaches a maximum height of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"40\"><math alttext=\"40\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> feet above the ground.
