The number 1 is indicated on both axes. The graph consists of a line segment and a curve. Two open circles and a closed circle are included in the graph. The line segment begins below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates negative 4 comma negative 3. It continues upward and crosses the x axis at negative 1, crosses the y axis at 1, and passes through the point with coordinates 3 comma 4. The line segment ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 5. Below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2. Below the closed circle is a second open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma negative 1. The curve begins at the open circle at the point with coordinates 4 comma negative 1. It moves downward and to the right until it reaches a minimum at the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 3. At this point, the curve moves upward and to the right, crossing the x axis at approximately 8.5, and passing through the point with coordinates 10 comma 5. The curve ends high above the x axis.\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH902610.g01.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"h\"><math alttext=\"h\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
