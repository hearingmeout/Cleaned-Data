[{"id":"FT1705","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p><img alt=\"The figure shows four line segments and one point on a gridded graph in the first and fourth quadrants.  The horizontal axis is labeled x, the vertical axis is labeled y, and the origin is labeled O. The numbers appearing on the x-axis, from left to right, are negative 1 to 8, in increments of 1. The numbers appearing on the y-axis, from bottom to top, are negative 4 to 4, in increments of 1.   From left to right, the first line segment starts at the point with coordinates zero comma 1, slants down and to the right, and ends at the point with coordinates 2 comma negative 1.  Both the starting point and ending point of this segment are included in the graph.  The second line segment starts at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1, slants up and to the right, and ends at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2.  The starting point of this segment is not included in the graph, but the ending point is included.  The third line segment starts at the point with coordinates 4 comma 2, slants down and to the right, and ends at the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 1. The starting point of this segment is included in the graph, but the ending point is not included.  The fourth line segment starts at the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 1, slants up and to the right, and ends at the point with coordinates 8 comma 1. The starting point of this segment is not included in the graph, but the ending point is included.  The point with coordinates 6 comma negative 3 is also included in the graph.  \" height=\"254\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/840a1fff2fde8293b260544a5793a092/original.png\" width=\"289\" /></p>\n\n<p>The figure above shows the graph of the function <em>f.</em> Which of the following statements are true?</p>\n\n<p>I. <span aria-label=\"limit x to 2 raised to the negative power of f times x is equal to f of 2\"><math> <mrow> <munder> <mrow> <mi>lim</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>→</mo> <msup> <mn>2</mn> <mo>−</mo> </msup> </mrow> </munder> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mn>2</mn> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </math></span></p>\n\n<p>II. <span aria-label=\"limit x to 6 raised to the negative power of f times x is equal to limit x to 6 raised to the plus power of f times x\"><math> <mrow> <munder> <mrow> <mi>lim</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>→</mo> <msup> <mn>6</mn> <mo>−</mo> </msup> </mrow> </munder> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <munder> <mrow> <mi>lim</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>→</mo> <msup> <mn>6</mn> <mo>+</mo> </msup> </mrow> </munder> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </math></span></p>\n\n<p>III. <span aria-label=\"limit x to 6 of f times x is equal to f of 6\"><math> <mrow> <munder> <mrow> <mi>lim</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>x</mi> <mo>→</mo> <mn>6</mn> </mrow> </munder> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>x</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mi>f</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mn>6</mn> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </math></span></p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>II only</p>","<p>III only</p>","<p>I and II only</p>","<p>II and III only</p>","<p>I, II, and III</p>"],"answer":1}]
