The numbers negative 1, 1, and 2 are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 5, 5, and 10 are indicated on the y axis. The line slants upward and to the right, passing through the origin. The curve begins below the line, to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, and intersects the line below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It continues upward and to the right, and begins to level off as it approaches the origin. It intersects the line again at the origin, and then moves gradually upward and to the right at first. The curve then moves more steeply upward and to the right, and intersects the line again before ending above the line, to the right of the y axis.
