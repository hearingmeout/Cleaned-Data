The numbers 1 through 9, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of four line segments, and includes four closed circles. The first line segment begins at the origin, and moves upward and to the right until it ends at a closed circle at the point with coordinates 1 comma 2. The second line segment begins at this closed circle, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at a second closed circle on the x axis at the point with coordinates 4 comma 0. The third line segment begins at this closed circle, and moves upward and to the right. It passes through the point with coordinates 5 comma 2, and continues upward until it ends at a third closed circle at the point with coordinates 6 comma 4. The fourth line segment begins at this closed circle, and moves downward and to the right.
