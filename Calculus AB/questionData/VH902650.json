The graph consists of two line segments. An open circle and a closed circle are included in the graph. The first line segment begins below the x axis, and to the left of the y axis. It moves upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates negative 1 comma negative 2, the origin, and the point with coordinates 1 comma 2. It continues upward until it ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 4. Below this open circle is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 2 comma 1.
