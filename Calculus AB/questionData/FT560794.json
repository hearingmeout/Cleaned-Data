[{"id":"FT560794","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p><img alt=\"  The figure shows a slope field in a gridded x y plane. There are nine congruent line segments on the figure that appear in three columns of three parallel segments. The first and steepest column of parallel segments have midpoints at the coordinates, from top to bottom, negative 1 comma 2, negative 1 comma 1, and negative 1 comma zero. For each of these segments, one endpoint is a quarter unit to the left and a half unit above the midpoint, and one endpoint is a quarter unit to the right and a half unit below the midpoint. The second column of parallel segments have midpoints on the y axis at 2, 1 and the origin. For each of these segments, one endpoint is a half unit to the left and a quarter unit above the midpoint, and the other endpoint is a half unit to the right and a quarter unit below the midpoint. The third column of parallel segments have midpoints at the coordinates, from top to bottom,  1 comma 2, 1 comma 1, and 1 comma zero. The exact location of the two endpoints of each of these segments is not specified. For each of these segments, one endpoint is more than a half unit to the left and slightly above the midpoint, and the other endpoint is more than a half unit to the right and slightly below the midpoint.\" height=\"310\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/9e0b91f3447e3977dc87029ae1eca6b4/original.png\" width=\"325\" /></p>\n\n<p>A slope field for a differential equation is shown in the figure above.
