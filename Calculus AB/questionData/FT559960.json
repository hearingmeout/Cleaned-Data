The endpoints are included in each of the line segments. From left to right, the first segment starts at negative 4 comma negative 4, goes up and crosses the x axis at negative 2, and continues up to zero comma 4. The second segment starts at zero comma 4 and goes down to the x axis at 2 comma zero. The third segment starts on the x axis at 2 comma zero and goes up to 4 comma 4.
