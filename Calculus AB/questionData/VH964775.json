The numbers negative 2 through 2, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 0.2 through 1.0, in increments of 0.2, are indicated on the y axis. The curve begins at the point with approximate coordinates negative 2 comma 0.8, and moves upward and to the right until it reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates negative 1.6 comma 1.0. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches a local minimum at the origin. The curve then moves upward and to the right until it reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 1.6 comma 1.0. It then moves downward and to the right until it ends at the point with approximate coordinates 2.5 comma 0.4. The line begins below the x axis, to the left of the y axis, and moves upward and to the right. It intersects with the curve at the origin, and continues upward above the curve. It then intersects the curve again at the point with approximate coordinates 0.5 comma 0.3, and continues upward below the curve. The line then intersects the curve at the point with approximate coordinates 1.9 comma 0.9 before ending above the curve.
