The numbers 1 through 9, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 1 and 1 are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of six line segments. The first line segment begins on the y axis at 1. It moves downward and to the right, crossing the x axis at 1, and ends at the point with coordinates 2 comma negative 1. The second line segment begins where the first line segment ends, and moves upward and to the right. It crosses the x axis at 3, and ends at the point with coordinates 4 comma 1. The third line segment begins where the second line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right. It crosses the x axis at 5, and ends at the point with coordinates 6 comma negative 1. The fourth line segment begins where the third line segment ends, and moves upward and to the right until it ends on the x axis at 7. The fifth line segment begins where the fourth line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 8 comma negative 1.
