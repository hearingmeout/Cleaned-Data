[{"id":"FT1882","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p><img alt=\"The graph of v of t is drawn on a set of unscaled axes for positive values of t.  Four points, j, k, l, and m are placed on the horizontal axis where 0 &lt; j&lt; k&lt; l&lt; m.  The graph of v intercepts the horizontal axis at t = 0, t = k, and t = m.  The graph of v lies above the horizontal axis between t = 0 and t = k.  The graph of v lies below the x-axis between t = k and t = m.  The graph of v has an absolute maximum at t = j and an absolute minimum at t = l.  The graph of v is increasing from t = 0 to t = j, going from concave up to concave down at some unspecified value of t between 0 and j.  From t = j to t = k, the graph of v is decreasing and concave down.  From t = k to t = l, the graph of v is decreasing and concave up.  From t = l to t = m, the graph of v is increasing and concave up. \" maxwidth=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/b6242ece280bb3a2ffe8e5d8aac42c1c/original.png\" width=\"200\" /></p>\n\n<p>A particle moves along a straight line.
