The horizontal axis is labeled t, and the numbers 1 through 5, in increments of 1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled v of t, and the numbers negative 10 through 10, in increments of 5, are indicated. The curve begins at the origin, and moves steeply downward and to the right, until it reaches a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates 0.4 comma negative 13. It then moves upward and to the right, crossing the x axis at 1, and reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 1.5 comma 3. It then moves downward and to the right, passing through the x axis at 2, and reaches a local minimum at the point with approximate coordinates 2.5 comma negative 2. The curve then moves upward and to the right, passing through the x axis at 3, and reaches a local maximum at the point with approximate coordinates 3.5 comma 2. It then moves downward and to the right until it reaches a local minimum on the x axis at 4. The curve then moves steeply upward and to the right, until it ends at approximately x equals 4.5, high above the x axis.   \" height=\"284\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH915941.g02.png\" width=\"450\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A particle moves along the <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"y\"><math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-axis.
