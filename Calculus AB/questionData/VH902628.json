The graph is a curve, and four points, labeled A, through D, are indicated on the curve. Two tick marks, labeled a, and b, are indicated on the x axis. Tick mark a, is to the right of the y axis and close to the origin, and tick mark b is far to the right of the origin. A dashed vertical line is drawn from each tick mark. There are no tick marks on the y axis. The graph begins on the dashed line at tick mark a, high above the x axis, and curves upward and to the right, until it reaches a maximum at point A. At this point, the graph begins to curve downward and to the right, and passes through point B, which is just below and to the right of point A. The graph continues moving downward, passing through point C, which is approximately halfway between the dashed lines at tick marks a, and b, and approximately halfway along the y axis. The graph continues moving downward, until it begins to level off slightly above the x axis, and near the dashed line at tick mark b. At this point, the graph begins to curve upward and to the right, until it passes through point D, which is just to the left of the dashed line at tick mark b and just above the x axis. The graph then continues upward until it ends on the dashed line at tick mark b, just above and to the right of point D.\" height=\"219\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH902628.g03.png\" width=\"215\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the trigonometric function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"a, less than or equal to x, less than or equal to b\"><math alttext=\"a, less than or equal to x, less than or equal to b\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
