The curve begins at the origin, and moves downward and to the right. It levels off at approximately t equals 1, just below the horizontal axis. It then moves upward and to the right, crossing the horizontal axis at t equals 2, and continuing upward until it levels off at approximately t equals 4.5, high above the horizontal axis.
