The numbers negative 4 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the x axis. The numbers negative 2 through 4, in increments of 1, are indicated on the y axis. The graph consists of three curves and two line segments. Three open circles and one closed circle are included in the graph. The first curve begins to the left of the y axis, just above y equals 1, and moves almost horizontally to the right at first. It then moves gradually upward and to the right until it reaches an open circle at the point with coordinates negative 1 comma 3. The first line segment begins at this open circle, and moves downward and to the right until it ends at an open circle at the point with coordinates negative 0.5 comma 1. The second line segment begins at this open circle and moves horizontally to the right until it ends at the point with coordinates 1 comma 1. The second curve begins where the second line segment ends, and moves downward and to the right. It crosses the x axis at 1.5 and begins to level off as it approaches an open circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma negative 1. Directly above this open circle, is a closed circle at the point with coordinates 3 comma 0.5. The third curve begins at this closed circle and moves steeply upward and to the right, passing through the point with coordinates 4 comma 2, and ends high above the x axis, to the right of the y axis.\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH934797.g05.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph of the function <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"f\"><math alttext=\"f\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is shown above.
