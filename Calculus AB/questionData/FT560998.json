There are evenly spaced tick marks on the x axis labeled negative 3 to 3.  There are evenly spaced tick marks on the y axis labeled 1 to 6. The graph consists of a point and two curves. The point is at 1 comma 2. The first curve begins to the left of x equals negative 2 and above y equals 6. It moves steeply down, then gradually levels, intersecting the y axis at 2. To the right of the y axis, the first curve moves gradually up and ends at an open dot at 1 comma 3. The second curve begins at an open dot at 1 comma 4, moves gradually up and to the right, becoming steeper before ending to the right of x equals 2 and above y equals 6.\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/56b2347523c899fc02db1a1c2b68f655/original.png\" width=\"245\" /></p>\n\n<p>The graph of the function f is shown in the figure above.
