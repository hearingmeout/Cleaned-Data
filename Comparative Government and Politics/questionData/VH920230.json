Its representatives have an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. It could be argued that devolution is a way for the other nations in the UK to distinguish themselves from England. The ‘English Question’ encompasses a number of questions about England’s governance. How, within the Union, should England be governed? Is there a way to allow England a separate voice within the UK without undermining the Union? Should power be devolved or decentralised, and if so how?</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The governance of England is becoming a key concern for those considering the territorial constitution. Witnesses noted the absence of consideration of England when politicians discussed devolution, one of them calling it the ‘elephant in the room’ . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Professor [Sir] Jeffery [Jowell] noted the emergence of England as a theme in the 2015 general election.
