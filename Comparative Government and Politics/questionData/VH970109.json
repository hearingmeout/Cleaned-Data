The IMF recognized that many reforms would take years to complete, especially the construction of the legal infrastructure for a market economy, privatization and restructuring of large enterprises, and the creation of a market system for banking and finance. But this was not seen as a reason for postponing the main stabilization and liberalization measures, with some specific exceptions, such as gradually rather than suddenly raising the prices of public utilities and housing rents and reducing export taxes on energy and other basic imports. Thus IMF views were similar to those of Russian reformers and many foreign observers. As a consequence, the IMF was often in the position of endorsing policies proposed by reformers [in the Duma and elsewhere] with little need to push for major changes in them.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: https://www.imf.org.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Russian government refused to follow the IMF requirement for very gradual liberalization reforms.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Russian government requested the European Union to assist with the economic liberalization process.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Russian government aligned its views with the IMF, which made the economic liberalization process more expedient.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Russian government, under the advice of the IMF, rapidly raised rents, which caused protests in Moscow in other major cities.</p>"],"answer":2}]
