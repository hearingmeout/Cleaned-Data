The widespread fraud alleged by the leading opposition candidate, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, and the .·.·. (political system’s) repressive response irrevocably shattered an unspoken contract between the government and the people—one in which the theocratic government had allowed some popular political participation and limited personal space in return for the people’s acquiescence to the status quo.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Even the highest authority in Iran, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, did not escape censure by the opposition—a traditional “red line” in Iranian politics that clerics, politicians, and voters alike crossed numerous times after the polls closed.

In so doing, he altered the role of the office he occupied.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: Alireza Nader, David E. Thaler, and S.R.
