Today’s Iran is still more modern, still more urban, still more demanding of civil rights and freedoms than the Iran of the 1970s. The postrevolutionary regime has dramatically expanded access to education, partly as a consequence of sex segregation and forced veiling, which have made university life less alienating for the most traditional families, and partly . . . because Iranian clerics esteem education as a universal good. The expansion of literacy, together with vast improvements in rural infrastructure and social services, has done much to promote social mobility in Iran. But Iran’s expanding middle class exerts pressure on the state that nurtured it, and which has failed to make a stable space for it in an economy dependent on oil. The Islamic Republic has vacillated in its response to these and other pressures. The constitution itself sometimes seems to suggest two opposing answers to every question; passionately held contradictory ideas sustain the Iranian state in permanent tension. Tension has become a stability of sorts.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: Laura Secor, “From Shah to Supreme Leader: What the Iranian Revolution Revealed,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Foreign Affairs</span>, January/February 2014.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Demands for greater theocratic rule</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Demands for rule of law</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Pleas for a socialist state</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Pleas for civil rights</p>"],"answer":3}]
