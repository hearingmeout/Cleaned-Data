The first is the president’s strong claim to democratic, even plebiscitarian, legitimacy; the second is his fixed term in office. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">. . . In a presidential system, the legislators, especially when they represent cohesive, disciplined parties that offer clear ideological and political alternatives, can also claim democratic legitimacy. This claim is thrown into high relief when a majority of the legislature represents a political option opposed to the one the president represents. . . . Who has the stronger claim to speak on behalf of the people: the president or the legislative majority that opposes his policies? Since both derive their power from the votes of the people in a free competition among well-defined alternatives, a conflict is always possible and at times may erupt dramatically. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The second outstanding feature of presidential systems—the president’s relatively fixed term in office—is also not without drawbacks. It breaks the political process into discontinuous, rigidly demarcated periods, leaving no room for the continuous readjustments that events may demand. The duration of the president’s mandate becomes a crucial factor in the calculations of all political actors, a fact which . . . is fraught with important consequences.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Source: Linz, Juan. “The Perils of Presidentialism.” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Journal of Democracy</span> 1:51-69, 1990.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Presidential governments are more democratic because there are more direct elections for top-level government officials.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Presidents derive their legitimacy from the party or coalition of parties they represent.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Passing laws on policy may be more efficient in parliamentary governments because the legislative and executive branches are fused.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Presidential and legislative elections should be held at the same time for greater democratic legitimacy.</p>"],"answer":2}]
