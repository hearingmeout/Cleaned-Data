The IMF recognized that many reforms would take years to complete, especially the construction of the legal infrastructure for a market economy, privatization and restructuring of large enterprises, and the creation of a market system for banking and finance. But this was not seen as a reason for postponing the main stabilization and liberalization measures, with some specific exceptions, such as gradually rather than suddenly raising the prices of public utilities and housing rents and reducing export taxes on energy and other basic imports. Thus IMF views were similar to those of Russian reformers and many foreign observers. As a consequence, the IMF was often in the position of endorsing policies proposed by reformers [in the Duma and elsewhere] with little need to push for major changes in them.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: https://www.imf.org.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF sent in peacekeeping forces to apply pressure on the Russian government to reduce tariffs.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF required the privatization of industry and trade liberalization in exchange for economic assistance.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF pressured policy makers to quickly raise housing rents, taxes, and the cost of public utilities.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF forced the Russian government to privatize the oil industry and to join the World Trade Organization.</p>"],"answer":1}]
