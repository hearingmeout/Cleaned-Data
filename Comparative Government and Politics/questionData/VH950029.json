They are belatedly joining the current unrest, which is evolving to include new social classes of people who were not at the center of previous protests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Although this momentum has not been linear, neither were the Arab uprisings in 2011. The Iranian demonstrators’ demands -- food subsidies, jobs and lower prices -- are perfectly attainable if the regime re-allocates its resources from the military to the economy. The fact that it is highly unlikely to do so, coupled with the demonstrators’ resentment, could inspire more protests in the near future that may forge a broader alliance between the middle class and the working class. It is unlikely that this simmering social movement will wait another decade to rear its head.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para text-right\">Source: Geneive Adbo and Abdalla Hendawy, \"Iran's Latest Revolution Won't Fade Away,\" Bloomberg Opinion, January 19, 2018.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because social movements lack organized hierarchy, it is difficult to meet their demands, and Iran is likely to face continued political instability.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It is wrong to conflate the Green Movement, which was about foreign direct investment, with this most recent movement, which is about economic struggle.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Iran has a strong state that is able to suppress opposition movements and is able to control all social media posts about political protests.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Since the Green Movement was not successful, citizens have stopped believing that protests are an effective means of voicing frustration with the government.</p>"],"answer":0}]
