The IMF recognized that many reforms would take years to complete, especially the construction of the legal infrastructure for a market economy, privatization and restructuring of large enterprises, and the creation of a market system for banking and finance. But this was not seen as a reason for postponing the main stabilization and liberalization measures, with some specific exceptions, such as gradually rather than suddenly raising the prices of public utilities and housing rents and reducing export taxes on energy and other basic imports. Thus IMF views were similar to those of Russian reformers and many foreign observers. As a consequence, the IMF was often in the position of endorsing policies proposed by reformers [in the Duma and elsewhere] with little need to push for major changes in them.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: https://www.imf.org.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF provided financial assistance to Russia, which influenced the types of restructuring Russia could undertake.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF demanded that all reforms be finished within two years, which had a negative effect on the banking and finance sectors.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF required the Communist Party to be completely dismantled before distributing funds to the Russian government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The IMF called for Russia to be part of the European Union and join other international organizations.</p>"],"answer":0}]
