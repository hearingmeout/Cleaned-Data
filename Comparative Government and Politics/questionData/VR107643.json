The horizontal axis is labeled Year, and the years 1985 through 2015, in increments of 5 years, are indicated. The year 2017 is also shown at the end of the horizontal axis. Information beneath the horizontal axis shows the Soviet Union existed from 1985 through 1990. The Soviet Union Ended in 1991, after which the Russian Federation was formed. The vertical axis is labeled Life Expectancy, in years, and the numbers 64 through 73, are indicated. The data represented in the graph are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The line begins in the time of the Soviet Union at 1985 comma 68 years, and moves steeply upwards reaching 1986 comma 69.5 years. It then trends downwards and to the right, reaching the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 comma 68.5 years. The line continues steeply downwards and to the right as it enters the time of the Russian Federation and reaches 1994 comma 64.5 years. It then moves upwards and to the right to reach a minor peak at 1997 comma 67 years, after which it moves downwards and to the right to reach a valley at 2004 comma 65 years.  The line then trends steeply upwards and to the right, passing through 2015 comma 71 years, and ends at 2017 comma 72 years.\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR107633.g08.png\" width=\"530\" />\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Source: The World Bank, 2017.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The data are based on normative conclusions derived from census data, so they cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the data are not useful in any analyses of the Soviet Union or Russia over time.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The data do not distinguish between male and female life expectancy, which is an important distinction in Russia.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There are not enough data points to detect a clear trend regarding life expectancy at birth in Russia after 1991.</p>"],"answer":2}]
