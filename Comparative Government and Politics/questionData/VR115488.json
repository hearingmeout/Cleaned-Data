China is a significant source of  foreign direct investment in Africa; offers development loans to resource-rich nations . . . invests in agriculture; and develops special trade and economic cooperation zones in several states . . . “Chinese banks and companies are offering finance that allows them to secure a greater share of the business deals in Africa as part of their move to ‘go global.’ This brings with it risks for African borrowers—but also opportunities,” writes Brautigam.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Chinese financing comes often in the form of loans and credits provided by the People’s Bank of China, the China Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, and the China-Africa Development Fund. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese banks, contractors, and the government loaned more than $86 billion to Africa . . . However, these large loans are beginning to raise questions about debt loads in African countries, showing indications of a potential debt crisis.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Council on Foreign Relations, 2019</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">African nations may adopt Communist principles to continue to attract Chinese aid.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Indebted African nations may lose sovereignty to the Chinese government and large banks.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">China may become a member of regional African economic organizations such as ECOWAS.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">China’s economic growth may become overly dependent on resources from Africa.</p>"],"answer":1}]
