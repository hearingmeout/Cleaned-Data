They are belatedly joining the current unrest, which is evolving to include new social classes of people who were not at the center of previous protests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Although this momentum has not been linear, neither were the Arab uprisings in 2011. The Iranian demonstrators’ demands -- food subsidies, jobs and lower prices -- are perfectly attainable if the regime re-allocates its resources from the military to the economy. The fact that it is highly unlikely to do so, coupled with the demonstrators’ resentment, could inspire more protests in the near future that may forge a broader alliance between the middle class and the working class. It is unlikely that this simmering social movement will wait another decade to rear its head.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para text-right\">Source: Geneive Adbo and Abdalla Hendawy, \"Iran's Latest Revolution Won't Fade Away,\" Bloomberg Opinion, January 19, 2018.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Demonstrators in Iran are unpredictable and unclear in their demands, which will lead them to be crushed by the government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Arab uprisings in 2011 were the catalyst for the protests in Iran.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Iranian state could meet the demonstrators’ demands and end the uprisings but probably will not.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Students were the largest group of protesters in Iran, and their issues were resolved in 2011.</p>"],"answer":2}]
