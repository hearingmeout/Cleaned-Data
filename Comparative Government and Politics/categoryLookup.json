Democratization","300961":"DEM-1: The way a regime uses power and authority to support or suppress its citizens establishes a balance between order and individual liberty.","300962":"DEM-1.A: Explain the nature and role of political participation as related to a regime's use of authority and power.","300963":"DEM-1.A.1: Political participation can be voluntary or coerced and may occur at the individual or group level.","300964":"DEM-1.A.2: Political participation can range from behavior supportive of a regime (either independently or under state direction) to oppositional behavior that seeks to change governmental policies or overthrow the regime.","300965":"DEM-1.A.3: Certain political conditions make it more likely that citizens will engage in violent political behavior, including when citizens feel that more conventional options for political participation are ineffective or unavailable.","300966":"DEM-1.A.4: Formal political participation (including casting ballots in elections) can be encouraged across regime types to enhance legitimacy, gather input, act as a safety valve, or apply a check on governmental policies, though authoritarian regimes are more likely to use citizen participation to intimidate opposition or give an illusion of influence, while democratic regimes hold elections to allow citizen control of the policy-making process.","300967":"DEM-1.A.5: Referenda allow citizens to vote directly on policy questions and are used for a variety of reasons, including as a means to promote democratic policy-making, to allow a chief executive to bypass the legislature, and to oblige citizens to make difficult and potentially unpopular decisions on public policy issues. The United Kingdom has used referenda to decide questions about the devolution of powers to regional assemblies, the separation and creation of an independent nation-state, and their withdrawal from the European Union.","300968":"DEM-1.B: Explain how political participation affects and is affected by democratic or authoritarian regime types.","300969":"DEM-1.B.1: Authoritarian and democratic regimes support similar forms of participation to influence policy-making (including casting votes in public elections) but differ in how much impact citizens have on policies and policy-making based on how open and competitive elections are. In many elections in authoritarian regimes there are few if any opposition candidates-those advocating differing views from that of the controlling party/elite-who are allowed to run for office. The government often intervenes in these elections to ensure that its preferred candidates and parties win.","300970":"DEM-1.B.2: Informal participation, such as protests, and political criticism expressed through social media, is treated differently across regime types. In authoritarian systems there is less tolerance of critical viewpoints that may challenge authoritarian regimes.","300971":"DEM-1.B.3: Both authoritarian and democratic regimes regulate formal political participation by placing restrictions on voting access and disallowing disruptive and violent protests, but authoritarian regimes manage and limit citizen participation to a much greater extent.","300972":"DEM-1.B.4: Authoritarian regimes tolerate mass political protests and movements less than democratic regimes do, valuing public order more than individual liberties and civil rights.","300973":"DEM-1.C: Explain the extent to which civil rights and civil liberties are protected or restricted in different regimes.","300974":"DEM-1.C.1: Protection of key civil liberties differs across the six course countries.","300975":"DEM-1.C.2: Both democratic and authoritarian regimes impose constraints on the media to protect citizens and maintain order, but democratic regimes generally tolerate a high degree of media freedom to encourage citizen control of the political agenda and check political power and corruption.","300976":"DEM-1.C.3: Stronger authoritarian regimes monitor and restrict citizens' media access to a greater degree to maintain political control, as represented by- a.

The Communist Party's control over China's military, which provided power and authority to maintain regime stability. b. The transition of power from dictatorial rule in Iran to a theocracy based on Sharia law after the 1979 Revolution. c. The transition of power in Nigeria and Mexico to multiparty republics following military rule and single-party dominance, respectively. d. The political elite's backing of a strong president in Russia, creating a managed democracy with election rules favoring one party. e. Constitutional reforms in the United Kingdom that devolved power to multiple parliaments allowing the regime to maintain stability.","301126":"PAU-1.D.2: How a regime chooses to use power in support of sovereignty is determined in large part by its democratic or authoritarian characteristics-democratic regimes can maintain sovereignty using less power than authoritarian regimes.","301127":"PAU-1.D.3: Changes in regimes occur when rules and institutions are replaced either incrementally or suddenly, as a result of elections, coups, or revolutions in which a large portion of the population supports a change in the political system.","301128":"PAU-1.D.4: Governments, including political officeholders, can be changed more frequently and easily than regimes through the relatively peaceful process of elections, appointments, and line of succession.

China's president serves as commander in chief, chair of China's Military Commission, and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist party (NPC); the president nominates the premier of the NPC who in turn serves as head of government overseeing the civil service; changes in top leadership are accomplished behind closed doors. b. Iran's Supreme Leader sets the political agenda, serves as commander in chief, and appoints top ministers, the Expediency Council, half of the Guardian Council, and the head of the judiciary. The president is elected for up to two 4-year terms, oversees the civil service, and conducts foreign policy. c. Mexico's elected president, as both head of state and head of government, serves as commander in chief and leader of the bureaucracy, and can approve domestic legislation and lead foreign policy; the president is restricted to one term. d. Nigeria's elected president, as both head of state and head of government, serves as chief executive, commander in chief, and head of civil service, and can approve domestic legislation and conduct foreign policy. e.

The prime minister can call elections, sets the foreign policy agenda, and serves as de facto commander in chief and chief executive over the civil service.","301144":"PAU-3.C.3: Executive term limits have advantages and disadvantages with regards to promoting stability and effective policies in a country- a. Advantages of executive term limits are that they check executive power by and inhibit the emergence of dictators and personality rule; help to focus the officeholder on governing rather than winning elections; and provide opportunities for new leaders with new ideas, policies, or goals. b. Disadvantages of executive term limits are that they force good executives to leave office; allow insufficient time for an office holder to achieve goals; impede policy continuity; weaken accountability; create a lame-duck period for the officeholder; prevent the officeholder from building experience as chief executive; and can cause poorly designed policy.","301145":"PAU-3.D: Describe procedures for the removal of executive leadership by other institutions.","301146":"PAU-3.D.1: Across the course countries, executive leaders can be removed by the legislative branch through different procedures that control the abuse of power.","301147":"PAU-3.E: Describe legislative structures and functions in course countries.","301148":"PAU-3.E.1: Legislative institutions of course countries include the following structures and functions- a.

Iran's theocracy is unicameral; the Majles is elected and holds the power to approve legislation, oversee the budget, and confirm presidential nominees to the Cabinet. This body acts under the supervision of the Guardian Council to ensure compatibility with Islam and Sharia law. c. Mexico's congressional-presidential system is bicameral. It consists of an elected lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-that approves legislation, levies taxes, and verifies outcomes of elections. The elected upper house, the Senate, holds the unique power to confirm presidential appointments to the Supreme Court, approve treaties, and approve federal intervention in state matters. d.

Both chambers hold the power to approve legislation, and the Senate possesses unique impeachment and confirmation powers. e. Russia's parliamentary-hybrid system is bicameral, and consists of an elected state Duma, which passes legislation and confirms the prime minister. An appointed Federation Council approves budget legislation, treaties, judicial nominees, and troop deployment. f. The United Kingdom's parliamentary system is bicameral, consisting of an elected House of Commons-which approves legislation-and the prime minister appointed by the monarch, whereas an appointed House of Lords reviews and amends bills from the Commons, effectively delaying implementation as a power check.","301149":"PAU-3.F: Explain how legislative powers are constrained by other institutions and/or processes, which can affect legislative independence.","301150":"PAU-3.F.1: Legislative powers can be constrained by other governmental institutions, including- a. China's Politburo Standing Committee, which is the actual center of power in the Chinese state. b. China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), which assumes legislative duties most of the year when the NPC is not in session, sets NPC legislative agenda, supervises NPC member elections, and interprets the Constitution and laws. c.

In China, rule by law (instead of rule of law) means the judicial system is subservient to the decisions of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), which controls most judicial appointments. b. The Iranian judiciary's major function is to ensure that the legal system is based on religious law, so judges must be trained in Islamic Sharia law. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and can nominate half of the Guardian Council with approval by the Majles. c. The Mexican judiciary is in transition-the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review and subsequent constitutional amendments have been implemented with the intent to make the system more independent and effective. d. In Mexico, Supreme Court magistrates are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate for a term of 15 years. e. The Nigerian judiciary has the power of judicial review, and an effort has been made to reestablish its legitimacy and independence by reducing corruption; under the system of federalism, Islamic Sharia Courts have been established in the north. f.

Russia's government uses the judicial system to target opposition, and although constitutionally the courts have the power of judicial review, this power has not been used to limit the authority of the governing branches. h. In Russia, judges are nominated by the president and approved by the Federation Council. i. The United Kingdom's judicial system uses common law to enforce the rule of law; major functions of the Supreme Court include its serving as the final court of appeals, protecting human/civil rights and liberties, and ruling on devolution disputes.","301154":"PAU-3.H: Explain the importance of independent judiciaries relative to other political institutions.","301155":"PAU-3.H.1: The degree of the judiciary's independence from other branches of government depends on the amount of authority the courts have to overrule executive and legislative actions, the process by which judicial officials acquire their jobs, the length of judicial terms, the professional and academic backgrounds that judicial officials are expected to have, and the processes used to remove judges from their posts.","301156":"PAU-3.H.2: Independent judiciaries can strengthen democracy by maintaining checks and balances, protecting rights and liberties, establishing the rule of law, and maintaining separation of powers.","301157":"PAU-4: The power, influence, and strength of political parties and the degree of competition between parties reflect the values of the regime or type of government.","301158":"PAU-4.A: Describe characteristics of political party systems and party membership.","301159":"PAU-4.A.1: Party systems and membership differ among course countries, ranging from dominant party systems to multiparty systems.","301160":"PAU-4.A.2: China has rules that allow only one party, the Communist Party of China, to control governing power to maintain the values of centralism and order, while allowing eight other parties to exist to broaden discussion and consultation.","301161":"PAU-4.A.3: Rules ensuring one-party dominance in Russia include increasing party registration requirements, allowing only legally registered parties to run for office, using selective court decisions to disqualify candidates, limiting the ability of political opposition to present their viewpoints in the media, increasing threshold rules to limit party access to the ballot, and eliminating gubernatorial elections.","301162":"PAU-4.A.4: Rules that facilitate Mexico's transition away from one-party dominance include eliminating el dedazo, privatizing state-owned corporations to decrease patronage, decentralizing and reducing one-party power at the subnational level, and establishing and strengthening the National Electoral Institute (IFE).","301163":"PAU-4.A.5: The degree of competition within multiparty systems can influence representation and formal political participation by citizens- a. Nigeria's multiparty system includes 30 registered political parties, with two strong parties, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress of Nigeria (APC), and a third party having a degree of electoral success. b. The United Kingdom's party system features competition primarily between two major parties, the Conservative and Labour parties, which control the legislature and executive (with first-past-the-post election rules favoring the major parties). But minor parties with regional representation are also able to win some legislative representation.","301164":"PAU-4.A.6: Catch-all political parties can earn support from groups with different characteristics, attracting popular support with ideologically diverse platforms.","301165":"PAU-4.A.7: Some legislatures, such as the United Kingdom's House of Commons, are highly organized by political parties, with voting based on strict party discipline that influences policy-making.","301166":"PAU-4.B: Explain how political party systems and memberships link citizen participation to policy-making.","301167":"PAU-4.B.1: Party systems vary across the course countries in terms of rules governing elections, party structure, and laws regulating political parties, as represented by- a. In China, one party (Communist Party of China) has controlled the government (and military) since 1949, while minor parties have limited power to fill minor political offices. b. Iran lacks formal political party structures; parties operate as loosely formed political alliances with questionable linkage to constituents. c. In Mexico, multiparty system is dominated by National Action Party (PAN), the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); parties are allowed to form coalitions to nominate candidates for any particular election. d.         In Nigeria, multiple parties with ethnic quotas affect representation in the country's federal legislature. e. In Russia, one party has been dominating recent elections; diminished representation of smaller parties occurs because of changing threshold rules; the elimination and then reinstatement of single member districts has affected regional parties and the representation of independent candidates. f. In the United Kingdom, two large parties (Labour and Conservative) dominate the House of Commons. g. In the United Kingdom, single member district plurality elections diminish minor party representation. h.
