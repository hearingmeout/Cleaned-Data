Below the table, two graphs are drawn for the number of workers versus wage with respect to demand and supply. On a coordinate plane, the horizontal axis of the first graph is labeled Number of Workers and it ranges from 4 to 8 in increments of 1. The vertical axis of the first graph is labeled Wage and it ranges from 40 to 140 in increments of 20. A horizontal line is drawn from a value 75 on the vertical axis and this line is labeled Supply. Another line labeled M R P, starts from ordered pair 4 comma 100 and increases to ordered pair 5 comma 125, then slopes down and decreases to ordered pair 8 comma 50.  On a coordinate plane, the horizontal axis of the second graph is labeled Number of Workers and it ranges from 5.5 to 8 in increments of 0.5. The vertical axis of the first graph is labeled Wage and it ranges from 50 to 120 in increments of 10. A horizontal line is drawn from a value 75 on the vertical axis and this line is labeled Supply. Another decreasing line labeled M R P, starts from ordered pair 5.5 comma 112 and terminates at ordered pair 7.75 comma 55.\"></p><p>One point is earned for a supply curve horizontal at $75.(see either graph above).</p><p>One point is earned for a labor demand curve as in either graph below The demand curve must have two correct wage/labor combinations.</p><p>One point is earned for MRP = MFC.</p><p>One point is earned for 6 or &amp; workers.</p>","af":"<p></p>"}]},"FT540306-22_rubric_category_1":{"id":"FT540306-22_rubric_category_1","t":"custom","ti":"Part B","s":"<ul><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for an increase in the demand for labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for tying the increase in the demand for labor to the product price increase.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for correct number of workers.</p></li><li><p><strong>1/2 -</strong> for correct quantity of T-shirts produced.</p></li></ul>","o":[{"l":"0 points","v":0,"m":3,"d":"<p>The student earns none of the following points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for an increase in the demand for labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for tying the increase in the demand for labor to the product price increase.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for correct number of workers.</p></li><li><p><strong>1/2 -</strong> for correct quantity of T-shirts produced.</p></li></ul>","af":"<p></p>"},{"l":"1 point","v":1,"m":3,"d":"<p>The student earns one of the following points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for an increase in the demand for labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for tying the increase in the demand for labor to the product price increase.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for correct number of workers.</p></li><li><p><strong>1/2 -</strong> for correct quantity of T-shirts produced.</p></li></ul>","af":"<p></p>"},{"l":"2 points","v":2,"m":3,"d":"<p>The student earns two of the following points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for an increase in the demand for labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for tying the increase in the demand for labor to the product price increase.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for correct number of workers.</p></li><li><p><strong>1/2 -</strong> for correct quantity of T-shirts produced.</p></li></ul>","af":"<p></p>"},{"l":"3 points","v":3,"m":3,"d":"<p>The student earns all of the following points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for an increase in the demand for labor.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -</strong> for tying the increase in the demand for labor to the product price increase.</p></li><li><p><strong>1 -

For a given market demand curve, there will be an equilibrium price and quantity of output. There should be a second supply curve that incorporates all costs of production, including the external costs. The socially optimum level of output is found at the intersection of the market demand and the supply curve that incorporates all costs, both private and external. With the same market demand curve, at the social optimum, the equilibrium price should be higher and the equilibrium quantity lower. In essence, the unregulated private market will produce too much output at too low a unit price.</p><p>To achieve the socially optimum level of output the government could introduce a unit tax on output.

One price appears on the vertical axis, approximately halfway up the axis, and is labeled P sub M.   On the graph there is a downward-sloping line labeled D equals MSB, and two parallel upward-sloping lines labeled MSC and S equals MPC.   The D equals MSB line begins to the right of the vertical axis, moves down and to the right, passing through the MSC line at quantity Q sub S, passes through the S equals MPC line at a coordinate for Q sub M and P sub M, and ends before reaching the horizontal axis.  The upper leftmost sloping line, line MSC, begins to the right of the vertical axis, passes through the D equals MSB line at quantity Q sub S, and ends in the upper right section of the graph. The lower rightmost sloping line, line S equals MPC, begins to the right of the vertical axis and below the MSC line, moves up and to the right, passing through the D equals MSB line at a coordinate for Q sub M and P sub M, and ends in the upper right portion of the graph.  A triangular region between the two parallel lines, and to the left of Q sub M, and above the D equals MSB line, is shaded and labeled Deadweight Loss. \"></p><p>4 points:</p><ul><li><p>One point is earned for drawing a correctly labeled graph for the soybean market showing a downward sloping demand curve (or MSB), supply curve (or MPC), equilibrium quantity, Q<sub>M</sub>, and price, P<sub>M</sub>.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for drawing the marginal social cost curve above the supply curve.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for showing the socially optimal quantity, QS, at MSB=MSC or D=MSC.</p></li><li><p>One point is earned for showing the area representing the deadweight loss, shaded completely.</p></li></ul>","af":""}]},"VR041267-22_rubric_category_0":{"id":"VR041267-22_rubric_category_0","t":"custom","ti":"Part (a)","s":"<p>Select a point value to view scoring criteria, solutions, and/or examples and to score the response.</p>","o":[{"l":"0 points","v":0,"m":6,"d":"<p>The response not accurately include either of the criteria below.</p>","af":"<p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/c57c0fffeacc4f8e5f9b9d1df441d117/original.png?Signature=YpWCXk08Q9%2B%2FLt4utKCUYpXYcZg%3D&amp;Expires=1656667591&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZK5X2TAO66&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEBEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD3IIErLUh7qiWMVEFxA965RAXn7teUnCwmOfXln0F7bAIhAPzju4h0hVZlwBBHQpjYz3SEDJE6pyWSBUrLZECGSXsvKtIECDkQAxoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1IgyvgN54lWkPifzUqyAqrwTD4NlOdoQlQgHilIXMX0IFyfdk/FYp7KPoRDmCFZPkptvTu4dfizu67l2UdKsL%2BWYKbml%2BNOEzllzSsHBjKl8PG0ucTtYuPZSdyWLcjPDdU70gCx6V8CozGUQG7U4zg%2BErpr8UJ/DWAacF6rjDHfseWqd40Nepamiki70lzoivP6%2BVP7g2CEf4pWAd6vRqXGVrGRkvJhBcMNp8fVjudilB9UrA3EKiZKuqM9s1hi/Lqr2OPhnrBD/VVpj/o/Y5fMUZCnl/PXqPRIMH0Y9oOqBd94BROgPlp07ujkH3i9gUU5OVtpF6aVkvNzNpAHAKUIg3DQmuOYnqjpv2KdkHDSCBFYQwjBw1HDL0/UGP8gpr3zERZHV1BBM2iQreZdOrvK2kLJ7t5O3mkTQb4iY%2B4bduHhUl9YYngZ6mTU9QPIuyJSDtMFv3hAc5Z5GZYFnWzqAqU3qneZiHEavAP1PhjTlLZw1lG4BZyCsz5RCgUaIaGC3GvZrqSfx4DMyCJKAYWTWRiJruWaz1bQg9/BWnWmntSDQOUiOesngMWaHnUl4xzVA71DE8kZeCyhuHV6331z%2B7Vp2tHnT07g9T3dFBedzmv/daUCVmS74mDBagVIstFhJwIj4rT0r/eBrNWK0DTIre47zwURU6QmN1Q493Qtz8xYy1hyuADTy%2BuXSbw8PUG/Q0XyikDoFtfxFIAeqBhCtC6bKCeTbJE%2BBgD72GlEgpt6MMxdpiDTsmzk/5v6xUMOz1%2BJUGOqgBHtncahJwY0TK0btO5jcXa2Ml2PxdeVdDj6gbLTIWssUnqF6LdPsnMcttVmNbEVfAUBbw%2BligWBPvrc%2BjrOOBmcsPdLN/cP5Tc8QEwWrUBigig1xv8J0SRIkbn4n1GDxxGFHd3eE5kCxcuUmu2SSH0y6F3PoPs66V/9Gafpz5AXI8uKYMp7PFhOC%2BAqrfZ6p2h/oqKOnD/ErGB20%2B2pop0Gs8JzCRd%2BR/\" alt=\"The figure presents a graph of three lines and a curve in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane.

The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity, in millions of cases”. The vertical axis is labeled “Price per case, in dollars”. A linear demand curve is drawn in the space with a slope of negative one. The coordinates to follow are not labeled in the interior of the graph, but are identified by the values on the horizontal and vertical axes in a manner that will now be described. Lines are drawn from the following coordinates on the demand curve to the horizontal and vertical axes where the quantity and price values are then shown. The following are the coordinates on the demand curve: 2 comma 8; 3 comma 7; 4 comma 6; 5 comma 5; 6 comma 4; 7 comma 3; 8 comma 2; and 9 comma 1. Lines should be drawn from these coordinates to the price and quantity axes and the values labeled on the axes. There is also a supply curve. The supply curve intersects the demand curve at coordinate 5 comma 5.  The supply curve is linear and has a slope of positive one. The coordinates of the supply curve are 1 comma 1; 2 comma 2; 3 comma 3; 4 comma 4; 5 comma 5; 6 comma 6; 7 comma 7; and 8 comma 8.
