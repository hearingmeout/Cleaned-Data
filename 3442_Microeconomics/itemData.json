Three prices appear on the vertical axis, and are labeled from bottom to top, P sub 1, P sub 2, and P sub 3.

The Marginal Cost curve intersects with each of the other curves and the Average Total Cost curve is always above the Average Variable Cost curve.

When the Marginal Cost curve moves up and to the right, it intersects the other 2 cost curves at their minimum points; this line intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at a point labeled T and the Average Total Cost curve at a point labeled U and continues on through point V with coordinates Q sub 4 and P sub 3.

The horizontal axis is about twice as long as the vertical axis is high. The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity. The vertical axis is labeled Price. There are three curves on the graph. The M C curve, the A V C curve, and the A T C curve. The curve labeled M C begins just to the right and towards the top of the vertical axis. It moves steeply down and to right reaching a minimum point quickly, about one fourth of the way across the graph. The height of the minimum point of the M C curve is about one fifth of the way up the vertical axis. After reaching this minimum point, the M C curve gradually rises ending above the height it started at about four fifths of the distance across the length of the graph. The next curve is the A V C curve. It begins about one fourth of the way across the length of the graph, to the right of where the M C curve began, at about the same height as the M C curve. It declines, moving to the right, and reaches a minimum when it crosses the M C curve. It then begins to rise and ends on the right side of the graph well below, and to the right, of the M C curve. The last curve is the A T C curve. It starts just above where the M C and A V C curve started and just to the right of the A V C curve. The A T C curve has a similar shape as the A V C curve, falling, reaching a minimum, and then rising. But the A T C curve is always above the A V C curve, and the distance between the two curves gradually narrow as the curves move from left to right along the graph. The A T C curve reaches its minimum point, as it crosses the M C curve. The A T C curve crosses the M C curve to the right of where the A V C curve crosses the M C curve. Beyond the minimum point, the A T C curve rises, ending on the right side of the graph well below, and to the right, of the M C curve and above the A V C curve. Five coordinates on the graph have dashed lines going from them to either the vertical axis, the horizontal axis, or both axes. The first coordinate is associated with the minimum point on the M C curve. A vertical dashed line goes from this coordinate to the horizontal axis and identifies the quantity Q sub 2. A second coordinate is associated with the minimum point on the A V C curve. Dashed lines go from this coordinate to the horizontal axis and vertical axis. The vertical dashed line goes to the horizontal axis identifies the quantity Q sub 3. The horizontal dashed line goes to the vertical axis identifies the price P sub 1. The third coordinate is where the downward sloping portion of the M C curve intersects the horizontal dashed line that extends from P sub 1. A vertical dashed line emanates from this third coordinate and goes to the horizontal axis, which identifies the quantity Q sub 1. A fourth coordinate identifies the minimum point on the A T C curve. This fourth coordinate has two dashed lines emanating from it. One line is a horizontal dashed line that goes from the fourth coordinate to the vertical axis, which identifies the price P sub 2. The other line is a vertical dashed line that goes from the fourth coordinate to the horizontal axis, which identifies the quantity Q sub 4. The fifth coordinate is on the M C curve, just above and to the right of the intersection of the M C and A T C curves. There are horizontal and vertical dashed lines emanating from it. A horizontal dashed line emanates from this fifth coordinate to the vertical axis, which identifies the price P sub 3. A vertical dashed line extends from this point down to the horizontal axis, which identifies the quantity Q sub 5.\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH926473.g02.png\" width=\"500\"></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph above shows per unit cost information for firm X.

The vertical axis is labeled Price. The price axis identifies four prices from lowest to highest on the vertical axis, P sub 1, P sub 2, P sub 3, and P sub 4. There are four horizontal dashed lines drawn across the length of the graph associated with the four different prices. There are three curves labeled M C, A V C and A T C. The curve labeled M C begins just to the right of the vertical axis between price P sub 1 and price P sub 2. It moves slightly downward to the right until it hits the horizontal dashed line associated with price P sub 1. At that point, the M C curve hits its minimum and then increases until it ends in the upper right hand portion of the graph. The next curve is the A V C curve. It begins above the M C curve, between P sub 2 and P sub 3, just to the right of the vertical axis. It declines, moving to the right, and reaches a minimum when it touches the dashed line associated with P sub 2, and then begins to rise. At the minimum point of the A V C curve, the M C curve, the A V C curve, and the horizontal dashed line drawn at price P sub 2 all touch. At this point, the M C line dissects the A V C curve at its minimum point, and the horizontal dashed line is tangent to the minimum point on the A V C curve. Beyond the minimum point the A V C curve rises ending on the right side of the graph well below, and to the right of the M C curve. The last curve is the A T C curve.

The A T C curve moves along the same pattern as the A V C curve, falling, reaching a minimum, and then rising. The A T C curve reaches its minimum point when it touches the horizontal dashed line associated with price P sub 3. At the minimum point of the A T C curve, the MC curve, the A T C curve, and the horizontal dashed line drawn at price P sub 3 all touch. At that point the M C line dissects the A T C curve at the A T C curve’s minimum point and the horizontal dashed line drawn at P sub 3 is tangent to the minimum point on the A T C curve.

The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity. The vertical axis is labeled Price comma Cost. The horizontal axis is nearly twice as long as the height of the vertical axis. Curves D and M R both start from the same point near the top of the vertical axis. Curve D moves downward and to the right in a straight line, and ends when it reaches the horizontal axis on the far right side of the graph. Curve M R moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It is twice as steep as the D curve. Curve M R ends on the horizontal axis about half way across. Curve M C starts in the lower left hand corner of the graph near the origin. It moves very gradually upward, from left to right, with a slope closer to zero than one. It passes through the M R curve, and then passes through the D curve. Curve M C ends on the far right side of the graph in the middle. Curve A T C starts just to the right of the vertical axis above the D curve, but not as high up as the starting point of the D curve. The A T C curve moves downward and to the right. On this downward portion of the A T C curve, the straight D line has a point of tangency with the downward sloping portion of the A T C curve. The point of tangency of the D curve with the A T C curve occurs directly above the intersection of the M R and M C curves. The A T C curve continues to move downward, beyond the point of tangency, until it reaches a minimum point where it intersects with the M C curve. The A T C curve then begins to rise and ends at a height below from which it started on the far right side of the graph. Quantity Q sub 1 is identified, on the horizontal axis, by a vertical dashed line that extends from the point of tangency of the D curve with the A T C curve, down and through the point of intersection of the M R and M C curves, and continues down to the horizontal axis. Quantity Q sub 2 is identified, on the horizontal axis, where the M R curve hits the horizontal axis, and goes up to the D curve. Quantity Q sub 3 is identified, on the horizontal axis, by a vertical dashed line that extends from the intersection of the D and M C curves and down to the horizontal axis. Quantity Q sub 4 is identified, on the horizontal axis, by a vertical dashed line that extends from the intersection of the M C and A T C curves, passes through the D curve, and goes down to the horizontal axis.

There is one price identified on the vertical axis, P sub 0, about half way up the axis. There is a solid line that emanates from P sub 0 and goes across the entire length of the graph. There are three curves on graph. The M C curve, the A V C curve, and the A T C curve. The curve labeled M C begins near the vertical axis between the origin and P sub 0. It slopes upward with a slight upward bend. It intersects the P sub 0 line about midway through the graph. It ends in the upper portion of the graph about three fourths of the way across. The next curve is the A V C curve. It begins just to the right of the vertical axis at the price P sub 0. From there it moves slowly down and to the right until it reaches its minimum when it intersects with the M C curve. It then begins to rise ending on the right side of the graph well below, and to the right, of the M C curve and above the P sub 0 line. The last curve is the A T C curve. It starts well above the M C and A V C curves near the top of the vertical axis and just to the right of it. The A T C curve has a similar shape as the A V C curve, falling, reaching a minimum, and then rising. But the A T C curve is always above the A V C curve, and the distance between the two curves gradually narrows as the curves move from left to right along the graph. The A T C curve reaches its minimum point when it crosses the M C curve. This minimum point occurs above the P sub 0 line. Beyond the minimum point, the A T C curve rises ends on the right side of the graph well below, and to the right, of the M C curve and just to the left, but nearer the A V C curve than when it started. There are four quantities identified on the graph. Q sub 0 is to the left of the intersection of the M C curve and the A V C curve. There is a vertical dashed line that goes from Q sub 0 up to the A T C curve and crosses the other curves. Q sub 1 on the horizontal axis is associated with the intersection of the M C and the A V C curves. There is a vertical dashed line that goes from Q sub 1 up to the A T C curve. Q sub 3 on the horizontal axis is associated with the intersection of the M C and A T C curves. There is a vertical dashed line that goes from Q sub 3 up to the A T C curve.

The horizontal axis is slightly longer than the vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity. The following four quantities are indicated on the horizontal axis, from left to right: Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, Q sub 4. Quantity Q sub 1 is located about one sixth of the way along the horizontal axis. The distance from Q sub 2 to Q sub 1 is about twice the distance from Q sub 1 to the origin. The distance from Q sub 3 to Q sub 2 is about the same as the distance from Q sub 1 to the origin. The distance from Q sub 4 to Q sub 3 is slightly greater than the distance from Q sub 1 to the origin. Vertical grid lines emanate upward from each quantity on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis represents price, in U S dollars. The following three prices are indicated on the vertical axis, from bottom to top: P sub 1, P sub 2, P sub 3. Price P sub 1 is located a little more than one third of the way up the vertical axis. Price P sub 2 is located slightly above P sub 1. Price P sub 3 is located about five sixths of the way up the vertical axis. Horizontal grid lines emanate to the right from each price on the vertical axis. The three curves on the graph are labeled Demand, Average Total Cost, and Marginal Cost. The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis at price P sub 3, and moves horizontally and to the right, parallel to the horizontal axis. The Average Total Cost curve begins slightly above price P sub 3, and slightly to the left of quantity Q sub 1. It moves downward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 3. It continues to move downward and to the right, and reaches a minimum at the point with coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 1. It then turns to move upward and to the right, passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 2, and intersects the Demand curve a second time at the coordinates Q sub 4 comma P sub 3. The Average Total Cost curve ends to the right of quantity Q sub 4, and above price P sub 3, slightly above the height it began. The Marginal Cost curve begins below price P sub 1, and slightly to the right of quantity Q sub 1. It moves upward and to the right, slowly at first and then more steeply, and intersects the Average Total Cost curve at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 1. It continues to steeply move upward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve at the coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. The Marginal Cost curve ends just to the right of Q sub 3, and above price P sub 3.\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR023329.g03.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB Microeconomics","Security:Teacher Use Only"]},"cat":{"t":[309798,309816,309823,309841,309845,309848,375385,309780,309786,309787,309580,309716,309735,309736,309740],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Graph"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["No"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR023420":{"id":"VR023420","q":{"id":"VR023420","t":"mcq","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Currently, <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"X Y Z\"><math alttext=\"X Y Z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mtext>XYZ</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> Corporation can produce 50 units of output using 20 workers and 8 units of capital.

alt=\"The figure presents the graph of four curves in the first quadrant of a coordinate plane, with the origin labeled 0. The horizontal axis is labeled Quantity, and the values Q sub 1, Q sub 2, and Q sub 3 are indicated from left to right. Quantity Q sub 1 is located about one fourth of the way along the horizontal axis. Quantity Q sub 2 is located slightly to the right of quantity Q sub 2. The distance from Q sub 2 to Q sub 3 is about three times the distance from Q sub 1 to Q sub 2. Vertical grid lines extend upward from each value on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis represents price, in U S dollars, and the following values are indicated from bottom to top: P sub 1, P sub 2, P sub 3, P sub 4. Price P sub 1 is located about one third of the way up the vertical axis. Price P sub 2 is located a little bit above price P sub 1. The distance from P sub 2 to P sub 3 is slightly longer than the distance from P sub 1 to P sub 2. The distance from P sub 3 to P sub 4 is slightly shorter than the distance from P sub 1 to P sub 2. Horizontal grid lines extend to the right from each value on the vertical axis. The four curves are labeled Demand, Marginal Revenue, Average Total Cost, and Marginal Cost. The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis and high above price P sub 4, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 4, Q sub 2 comma P sub 3, and Q sub 3 comma P sub 1. It ends above the horizontal axis, and to the right of quantity Q sub 3. The Marginal Revenue curve begins where the Demand curve begins on the vertical axis, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, and ends slightly below the horizontal axis, and slightly to the right of quantity Q sub 2. The Average Total Cost curve begins just above price P sub 3, and in between the vertical axis and the Marginal Revenue curve, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price P sub 2, and reaches a minimum at the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2. It then turns to move upward and to the right, slowly at first and then more steeply, and intersects the Demand curve slightly above the price P sub 2, and in between quantities Q sub 2 and Q sub 3. It ends just above price P sub 3, and just to the left of quantity Q sub 3. The Marginal Cost curve begins slightly to the right of the vertical axis, and just below price P sub 1, and steeply moves downward and to the right. It then turns to steeply move upward, intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, intersects the Average Total Cost curve almost at price P sub 2, and intersects the Demand curve at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 3. It ends near the top of the graph, and slightly to the left of quantity Q sub 3. On the graph, there are six points that are labeled the following: I, J, K, L, M, N. Point I is located at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 4, and lies on the Demand curve. Point J is located at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 3, and lies on the intersection of the Demand and Marginal Cost curves. Point K is located in between quantities Q sub 2 and Q sub 3, just above price P sub 2, and lies on the intersection of the Demand and Average Total Cost curves. Point L is located at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, and lies on the intersection of the Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost curves. Point M is located at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 2, and lies on the Average Total Cost curve. Point N is located at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 3.\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR023851.g06.png\" width=\"350\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB Microeconomics","Security:Teacher Use Only"]},"cat":{"t":[309798,309824,309826,309841,309845,309848,375385,309780,309786,309787,309580,309716,309735,309746,309753],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Graph"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["No"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR023852":{"id":"VR023852","q":{"id":"VR023852","t":"mcq","s":"<div><span style=\"font-style: inherit;

Both the A T C and A V C curves are concave up curves. The A T C curve lies above the A V C curve.  When the price increases from P 1 to P 3, there will be a greater supply in quantity.

The horizontal axis is labeled Units of Output, and the following values are indicated from left to right: Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, Q sub 4, Q sub 5. The vertical axis represents price, in U S dollars. The graph has three curves that are labeled M C, A V C, and A T C. Curve M C begins in between the vertical axis and quantity Q sub 1, and about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis. It moves downward and to the right, reaches a minimum slightly to the left of quantity Q sub 1, and then turns to steeply move upward and to the right. It ends just to the right of quantity Q sub 5, near the top of the graph. Curve A V C begins slightly above and slightly to the right of where Curve M C begins, and moves downward and to the right. It intersects Curve M C at quantity Q sub 2, and then turns to move upward and to the right. It ends far to the right of quantity Q sub 5, and below where Curve M C ends. Curve A T C begins just to the right of where Curve A V C begins, and about three fourths of the way up the vertical axis. It steeply moves downward and to the right, intersects Curve M C at quantity Q sub 3, and then turns to steeply move upward and to the right. It ends just to the left and slightly above where Curve A V C ends. The following 5 points are identified on the graph: R, S, T, W, V. From Q sub 1 on the horizontal axis, a vertical grid line emanates upward and touches Curve M C, which identifies Point R.

It passes through the points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 4, Q sub 2 comma P sub 3, Q sub 3 comma P sub 2, and Q sub 4 comma P sub 1. It ends just above the horizontal axis, and to the right of quantity Q sub 5. The Supply plus Tax curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and in between prices P sub 1 and P sub 2. It moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects the Demand curve at the point with coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 3, and passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 4. It ends high above price P sub 4, and approximately at quantity Q sub 5. The Supply curve begins slightly to the left of quantity Q sub 1, and below price P sub 1. It moves upward and to the right in straight line, parallel to the Supply plus Tax curve. It passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 1, intersects the Demand curve at the points with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 2, and passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 5 comma P sub 3. It ends approximately at price P sub 4, and to the right of quantity Q sub 5, almost directly above where the Demand curve ends. Eight points are identified on the graph, and are labeled the following: R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. Point R is located at Q sub 1 comma P sub 4, and lies on the Demand curve. Point S is located at Q sub 2 comma P sub 3, and lies at the intersection of the Demand and Supply plus Tax curves. Point T is located at Q sub 2 comma P sub 2. Point V is located at Q sub 4 comma P sub 1, and lies on the Demand curve. Point W is located at Q sub 3 comma P sub 2, and lies at the intersection of the Demand and Supply curves. Point X is located at Q sub 3 comma P sub 4, and lies on the Supply plus Tax curve. Point Y is located at Q sub 5 comma P sub 3, and lies on the Supply curve. Point Z is located at Q sub 2 comma P sub 1, and lies on the Supply curve.\" height=\"279\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR041984.g01.png\" width=\"400\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Hats are produced in a perfectly competitive industry, and the government imposes a per-unit sales tax on hats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Using the labeling from the graph, identify each of the following.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(i) The after-tax price paid by consumers and the after-tax quantity</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(ii) The area representing the total tax revenue received by the government</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(b) Now assume instead that the demand for hats is perfectly inelastic at <span class=\"math_expression\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 3\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 3\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><msub><mrow><mtext>Q</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span></span>, while the supply and the per-unit tax remain unchanged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(i) Will the after-tax price paid by consumers be higher, lower, or the same compared to the price in your answer to part (a)(i) ?</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(ii) Will the total tax revenue received by the government be higher, lower, or the same compared to the tax revenue in your answer to part (a)(ii) ?

Q sub 1 is located about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. Q sub 2 is located about halfway along the horizontal axis. The three curves are labeled M P B, M S B, and M S C equals M P C. All three curves begin to the left of Q sub 1 at approximately the same distance, but at different heights. Curve M P B begins just over halfway up the vertical axis, moves downward and to the right in a straight line until it ends at a point that is to the right of Q sub 2 and just above the horizontal axis. Curve M S B begins almost directly above the point where curve M P B begins, near the top of the vertical axis, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. Curve M S B is parallel to curve M P B, and ends above and to the right of the end point of curve M P B. Curve M S C equals M P C begins almost directly below the starting point of line M P B, about one fourth of the way up the vertical axis.

Another vertical grid line is drawn upward from the horizontal axis at Q sub 2, which passes through curve M P B, and ends at the intersection of curves M S B and M S C equals M P C.

The curves in the graph are labeled D, M R, and M C. Curve D begins on the vertical axis at a point high above P sub 5 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through points with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 5, Q sub 2 comma P sub 4, and Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. Curve D ends far to the right of Q sub 3 and slightly below P sub 1. Curve M R begins at the same point as curve D high on the vertical axis and moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, crosses the horizontal axis at Q sub 2, and ends below the horizontal axis between Q sub 2 and Q sub 3. Curve M C begins at the origin and moves upward and to the right in a straight line. It intersects curve M R at the point with coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 1, passes through the point with coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 2, and then intersects curve D at the point with coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. Curve M C continues upward and to the right and ends far to the right of Q sub 3 and above P sub 5.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR188598.g05.png\"/></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Given the information in the graph provided, what is the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity and price combination?</p>\n","o":[{"v":"i1","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 1 comma P sub 1\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 1 comma P sub 1\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 3 comma P sub 3\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 3 comma P sub 3\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 2 comma P sub 2\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 2 comma P sub 2\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 2 comma P sub 4\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 2 comma P sub 4\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"},{"v":"i5","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\"><span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"Q sub 1 comma P sub 5\"><math alttext=\"Q sub 1 comma P sub 5\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>5</mn></msub></math></span></span></p>"}],"a":"i5","f":null,"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB Microeconomics"]},"cat":{"t":[309798,309824,309826,309841,309845,309847,309780,309786,309787,309580,309716,309735,309746,309753],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Graph"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR188603":{"id":"VR188603","q":{"id":"VR188603","t":"mcq","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Mary manages a manufacturing plant.

It passes through the points with coordinates 44 comma $108, 57 comma $100, and 77 comma $68. The Demand curve ends to the right of quantity 77, and between prices $35 and $55. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Demand curve begins, and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. The Marginal Revenue curve passes through the point with coordinates 44 comma $55, intersects the horizontal axis between quantities 57 and 77, and ends below the horizontal axis at quantity 77. The Average Total Cost curve begins to the right of the vertical axis, and high above price $108, and steeply moves downward and to the right.

The Average Total Cost curve reaches its lowest point, where it intersects the marginal cost curve, just above price $68 and between quantities 44 and 57. It then turns to move upward and to the right, and intersects the Demand curve again between quantities 57 and 77. The Average Total Cost curve ends to the right of quantity 77, and just above price $108. The Average Variable Cost curve begins on the vertical axis, and just below price $55, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point, where it intersects the Marginal Cost curve at coordinates 31 comma $35, and turns to move upward and to the right. The Average Variable Cost curve intersects the Marginal Revenue curve just above price $35 and between quantities 44 and 57, and then intersects the Demand curve at 77 comma $68. The Average Variable Cost curve ends just to the right of where the Average Total Cost curve ends, and between prices $100 and $108. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at the same point where the Average Variable Cost curve begins, and slowly moves downward and to the right. It reaches its lowest point at coordinates 21 comma $30, and turns to steeply move upward and to the right. The Marginal Cost curve intersects the Average Variable Cost curve at 31 comma $35, and then intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at 44 comma $55.

The horizontal axis is labeled “Quantity,” and the quantities Q sub 1, Q sub 2, Q sub 3, and Q sub 4 are indicated, from left to right. Q sub 1 is located about one sixth of the way along the horizontal axis. Q sub 2 is located about one third of the way along the horizontal axis. Q sub 3 is located about two thirds of the way along the horizontal axis. Q sub 4 is located about five sixths of the way along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled “Price Comma Cost,” and the prices P sub 1, P sub 2, P sub 3, P sub 4, P sub 5, P sub 6, and P sub 7 are indicated, from bottom to top. P sub 1 is located about one tenth of the way up the vertical axis. P sub 2 is located about one fifth of the way up the vertical axis. P sub 3 is located slightly above P sub 2. P sub 4 is located about two fifths of the way up the vertical axis. P sub 5 is located about halfway up the vertical axis. P sub 6 is located about three fifths of the way up the vertical axis. P sub 7 is located about nine tenths of the way up the vertical axis. Nine lettered points are indicated on the graph. Point a is located at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 6. Point b is located at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 5. Point c is located at the coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. Point d is located at the coordinates Q sub 4 comma P sub 2.

Point h is located at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 3. Point j is located at the coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 1. The four curves on the graph are labeled Demand, Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, and Average Total Cost. The Demand curve begins on the vertical axis at P sub 7 and moves downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through point a at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 6, passes through point b at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 5, and passes through point c at the coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. The Demand curve then passes through point g at the coordinates Q sub 4 comma P sub 1, and ends to the right of Q sub 4, and just above the horizontal axis. The Marginal Revenue curve begins on the vertical axis at P sub 7 and moves steeply downward and to the right in a straight line. It passes through point f at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 1, intersects the horizontal axis between Q sub 2 and Q sub 3, and ends below the horizontal axis. The Marginal Cost curve begins on the vertical axis at P sub 1 and moves horizontally to the right. It intersects the Marginal Revenue curve at point f at Q sub 2, passes through point j at Q sub 3, and intersects the Demand curve at point g at Q sub 4. The Marginal Cost curve ends to the right of Q sub 4. The Average Total Cost curve begins between P sub 6 and P sub 7, just to the left of Q sub 1, and moves steeply downward and to the right. It intersects the Demand curve at point a at the coordinates Q sub 1 comma P sub 6, and moves downward and to the right between the Demand curve and the Marginal Revenue curve. The Average Total Cost curve passes through point e at the coordinates Q sub 2 comma P sub 4, then moves downward and to the right at a decreasing rate. It intersects the Demand curve a second time at point c at the coordinates Q sub 3 comma P sub 3. The Average Total Cost curve then passes through point d at the coordinates Q sub 4 comma P sub 2, and ends just below P sub 2, and almost directly above where the Marginal Cost curve ends.\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/578/VR733776.g09.svg\" width=\"520\" /></div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The graph shows the cost and revenue curves for an unregulated, profit-maximizing monopoly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">(a) Is the firm shown in this graph a natural monopoly?
