The comparison first establishes the legal promise of equal rights in North Vietnam through a discussion of Document 3 and then uses the example of women’s rights in the United States to question whether that promise corresponded to reality: “The North Vietnam Constitution in Doc 3 also proves the Communist intention for equal working rights as ‘women enjoy equal pay with men.’ Although we still should question if women actually did, as laws aren’t always followed, seen even today as modern countries such as the USA where gender discrimination is outlawed, but a wage gap still exists.”</p><p>Example that did not accurately connect the argument to a development in a different historical period, situation, era, or geographic area:</p><p>A response that attempts to make a connection with a different historical period, situation, or geographical area but demonstrates inaccuracies and/ or misunderstanding of chronology or fact: “The table [Document 4] can be potentially biased because it is coming from another country, but it still shows how low Soviet women’s position in the workplace was. At the same time when women in the West are becoming more equal through the efforts of feminists in terms of working and being paid equally, Soviet women still don’t have many opportunities to work and many must stay at home.”</p><p><br><br></p><p>b) Responses can extend their argument by appropriately connecting the topic of communism’s effect on women’s rights to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question. An example of acceptable themes and/or approaches to history is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">environmental</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">economic</span> history (Synthesis proficiency C5). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.</p><p>Example of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question:</p><p>A possible example might be an essay that connects the communist rhetoric of gender equality in the workplace, and in society in general, to an analysis of Soviet-style economic development, with its emphasis on forced industrialization, full employment, and centrally planned economic parameters. Such a response might point out that having a workforce that incorporates all members of society of working age was essential for meeting the economic objective of the Soviet state. Alternatively, an analysis of Soviet economic priorities, with their unwavering emphasis on heavy industry and landmark macroeconomic projects, may have pointed out that producing consumer goods in many communist countries was seen as a relatively low priority, resulting in chronic shortages and deficits of food items and other basic needs. These shortages placed an especially heavy burden on women and, ultimately, discredited the regimes’ emancipatory rhetoric by the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>Example that did not appropriately connect the argument to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question:</p><p>The response attempts to incorporate economic analysis, but it does not go far enough to earn the point: “Communism, as they say, is a great idea until you run out of people’s money. So, with the focus of planned economy and not allowing for free markets, the women of Romania should not have been surprised they couldn’t find food to buy.”</p><p>c) Responses can extend their argument by using insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to explain the effects of communism on women’s rights (Synthesis proficiency C6). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.</p><p>Examples of acceptable synthesis by using insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to extend the argument:</p><p>A response might use insights from the discipline of comparative government and politics to extend the argument or qualify its interpretation of the documents: “While these documents [Document 3 and Document 5] paint a rosy picture of women’s life under communist rule, we know that women (like all communist citizens) did not have the right to express themselves freely, as there was censorship and a lack of free press. Likewise, we know from the political systems of communism that they all pretended to have a democratic system, while in reality the one single communist party was controlling everything. Elections happened, but they didn’t decide much, as only the candidates approved by the party could win. One could be sent to prison or worse if one protested his or her conditions too openly. Thus we should question how much it means to have laws or constitutions give equality to women, if the state and the party could change any policy they wanted.”</p><p>Example of an essay that did not appropriately use insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to extend the argument:</p><p>This response refers to knowledge from a different discipline (demography) that is broadly relevant to changes in gender and family dynamics in the 20th century, but it fails to connect these insights clearly and specifically to the topic of communism’s effect on women’s rights: “Like many countries going through industrialization, communist countries go from women having lots of children but few of them surviving in the early period to women having only one or two children who have a great chance of surviving to be adults. Eventually, the birth rates shrinks even further and population declines.”</p>"]}]
