The answer, we must say without evasion, is no. In addition to the military considerations, there is also the political angle. It should not be forgotten that Russia and Germany are representatives of the conservative principle in the civilized world, as opposed to the democratic principle represented by England and France. From this point of view, a war between Russia and Germany, regardless of the specific issues over which it is fought, is profoundly undesirable to both sides. Such a conflict, however it ends, would entail the weakening of the conservative principle of which the two powers are the only reliable bulwarks. Moreover, one must realize that, under the precarious conditions that now exist, a general European war is mortally dangerous to both Russia and Germany, no matter who wins.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">It is my firm conviction, based on long and careful study of the multitude of subversive tendencies and movements that we are presently facing, that there must inevitably break out in the defeated country a social revolution that, by the very nature of these things, will inevitably spread to the country of the victor. In our country today, there are countless agitators telling the peasant that he should demand a gratuitous share of somebody else’s land, or the worker that he should be getting hold of the entire capital and profits of the manufacturer. War with Germany will create exceptionally favorable conditions for such agitations.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Pyotr Durnovo, Russian Minister of the Interior, memorandum to Tsar Nicholas II, February 1914</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as socialists in the Balkans led revolutions that greatly weakened the Habsburg monarchy</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Mexican Revolution, as middle classes and peasants united to oust longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz and establish a more equitable society</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Boer War, in which Dutch-speaking white settlers inflicted several military defeats on British colonial armies in southern Africa</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The formation of the Triple Entente alliance, in which Great Britain, France, and Russia pledged to work together to check the rise of Germany</p>"],"answer":1}]
