I do not belong to the Indian world, but to that of my sisters who are struggling forward in the distant West. If the laws of my land permitted it, I would be like the new woman in Europe; but age-long traditions that cannot be broken hold us back. Someday those traditions will loosen and let us go, but it may be three, four generations after us. Oh, you do not know what it is to love this young, new age with heart and soul, and yet to be bound hand and foot, chained by all the laws, customs, and conventions of one’s land. All our institutions are directly opposed to the progress for which I so long for the sake of our people. Day and night I wonder by what means our ancient traditions could be overcome. But it was not the voices alone which reached me from that distant, bright, new-born Europe, which made me long for a change in existing conditions for women. Even in my childhood, the word ‘emancipation’ enchanted my ears and awakened in me an ever-growing longing for freedom and independence—a longing to stand alone.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Raden Adjeng Kartini, Javanese noblewoman in Dutch Indonesia, letter to a friend, Java, 1899</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>The socialist movement</p>","<p>The early feminist movement</p>","<p>The abolitionist movement</p>","The anti-imperialist movement"],"answer":0}]
