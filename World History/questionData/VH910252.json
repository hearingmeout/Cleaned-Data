It has been the assumption of the Green Revolution that nutrient loss and nutrient deficit can be made up by the use of non-renewable inputs of chemical fertilizers. The natural nutrient cycle, in which nutrients are produced by plants and returned to the soil as organic matter has thus been replaced by the belief in linear non-renewable flows of chemicals: phosphorus and potash mined from geological deposits and nitrogen derived from petroleum.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The Green Revolution created the perception that soil fertility is produced in chemical factories, and agricultural yields are measured only through marketed commodities. Yet, as the Punjab experience has shown, the fertility of soils cannot be reduced to Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium inputs from the factories of multinational corporations. Agribusiness technologies cannot substitute nature or work outside of nature’s ecological processes without destroying the very basis of agricultural production. Nor can markets provide the only meaningful measure of ‘output’ and ‘yields.’”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Vandana Shiva, Indian scholar, feminist, environmentalist, and anti-globalization activist, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Violence of the Green Revolution: Ecological Degradation and Political Conflict in Punjab</span>, book published in 1989.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Data on the increasing profits of multinational agribusiness corporations in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Data on the growing numbers of displaced persons as a result of international conflict in the late twentieth century</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Data on population and food production trends in developing countries before the advent of industrial farming in the mid-twentieth century</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Data on the growing rates of income inequality in developed countries in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries</p>"],"answer":2}]
