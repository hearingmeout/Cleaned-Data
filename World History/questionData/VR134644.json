It is hoped, however, that this would be offset by an improvement in the health of the people, leading in time to increased strength and activity which might encourage Gambian farmers to cultivate both more extensively and more intensively than they do at present, resulting ultimately in greater production of cash crops.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Letter from the British governor of the West African colony of Gambia to the British Committee on Nutrition in the Colonial Empire, 1936</p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Source 2</span>:</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Improvements in nutrition in Kenya must, as a matter of greatest importance, involve efforts to educate African women, to whom falls the care of the home and children.
