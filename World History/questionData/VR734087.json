Modern-educated Ottomans soon began to emphasize in their writings the importance of European sciences. . . . Science was seen by many officials and learned figures as the only tool to solve the problems of the empire. . . . This elite group of Westernized Ottoman intellectuals . . . even adopted the belief in the supremacy of science in all aspects of life and proposed to adopt a completely [Westernized] worldview.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">However, this [Westernized Ottoman] elite was not the only group that focused on modern European thought. Extreme views . . . sparked opposition, especially among religious circles, but they also kindled a general curiosity among . . . a new generation of modern Ottoman religious scholars who emphasized an alternative approach toward modernization. [These scholars] proposed to combine their traditional heritage with modern ideas and methods . . . [and], while advocating the adoption of industrialization and political reforms, rejected a cultural identification with the West.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">M.
