Similarly, to ‘de-center’ Europe from the process of creating a world history in the modern age is a task that presents a number of challenges that historians have by no means solved. They have not solved these challenges because the task of ‘de-centering’ Europe from world history is not, at its core, a historical task. It is, rather, a political task—one dictated by the interests of present-day globalized multicultural elites determined to keep the movement of people and capital fluid, without deeply held identities and without allegiance to national borders. In this task, all dissent is suppressed. Historians are expected to get with the program and, to our shame, the vast majority have done just that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">We need a more workable model of modern world history. To be sure, it needs to be a model that is stripped of the blind triumphalism of the old modernization theory of inevitable progress toward Westernization. But it also needs to be a model that does not react to the new global culture by cultivating fantasies of ‘the empire strikes back’ and predicting the ‘impending’ decline of the West, when no such revolution has ever been, or will ever be in the offing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Gregory Barton, historian of modern Great Britain, “The British Model of World History,” scholarly article, 2012</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
