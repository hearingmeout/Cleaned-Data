In general, the way to increase a country’s population is to increase the number of births and to decrease the number of deaths. Some European states adopt a number of methods to increase their birth rates: (1) additional government services are provided to people who are married and have many children; (2) discounts and tax rebates on expenses related to the education of children are provided; (3) awards are given to families with many children.</p>\n\n<p>In Iran, due to the special impact of our national morals and religious traditions, families have many children. Therefore, the best means to increase the Iranian population is to take measures to decrease the death rate. More governmental physicians and health officials are needed to prevent the wasting of the country’s human capital.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the lack of literature on child rearing available to Iranian mothers, and due to the absence of sufficient means for the treatment of ill children, more than 50% of all children born to Iranian families die before the age of seven. Through instructions and acquainting people with the literature on child rearing, as well as by providing families with free medical treatment, at least 90% of children could live to reach adolescence. In this context, patriotic women’s organizations must carry out serious and efficient actions to help invigorate the management of the country’s health.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Fereydun Keshavarz, Iranian pediatrician, article published in an Iranian newspaper, 1937</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>Effective forms of birth control gave women greater control over their fertility.</p>","<p>Diseases associated with poverty and underdevelopment were still prevalent in most world regions.</p>","<p>Military conflicts led to population decreases in many countries, followed by postwar baby booms.</p>","<p>The Green Revolution dramatically increased agricultural productivity and led to rapid population growth.</p>"],"answer":0}]
