To the rebellious slaves. Negroes, you have taken up arms against your masters, and have burnt and plundered their houses and buildings. Some wicked persons have told you that the king has made you free, and that your masters withhold your freedom from you. In the name of the king, I come amongst you, to tell you that you are misled. I bring with me numerous forces to punish the guilty, and all who are found with the rebels will be put to death, without mercy. You cannot resist the king’s troops. Surrender yourselves, and beg that your crimes may be pardoned. All who yield themselves, and beg that your crimes may be pardoned. All who yield themselves up at any military post immediately, provided they are not principals and chiefs in the burnings that have been committed, will receive his majesty’s gracious pardon. All who hold out, will meet with certain death. Willoughby Cotton, Major General Commanding. God save the king. \" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/573eefc620a681557da132d09f25dcc9/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Courtesy of The National Archives</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Commander Cotton’s reaction to the events in Jamaica, in the notice above, might best be understood in the context of which of the following?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>The expansion of the trans-Atlantic slave trade across the Caribbean</p>","<p>Mounting resistance to slavery in the Americas, reflected in challenges to imperial authority</p>","<p>Growing profitability of plantation slavery in the Americas</p>","<p>The waning influence of religious ideas and millenarianism in nationalist conflicts</p>"],"answer":0}]
