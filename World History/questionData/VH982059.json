He would talk to my father for hours on end. But, as children, we did not know what they were discussing. By the time the British declared a state of emergency in Kenya, I had already taken my first oath to the Mau Mau cause. Repeating carefully after the instructor, I swore to:</p><p class=\"passage_para\">1. Fight for the soil of Kenya, which had been stolen by the Whites.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">2. If possible, get a gun and any other valuables or money to help strengthen the movement.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">3. Kill anyone who was against the movement, even if that person was my brother.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The state of emergency and the fighting kept me from studying abroad and joining my sister and brothers, who were studying in England. Finding myself with more time on my hands, I became even more eager to learn about freedom activities and felt even more commitment to Mau Mau, convinced that it was the only way that Kenya could be free.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Matters worsened as the state of emergency continued. People were arrested arbitrarily by the colonial authorities, and Black collaborators accused people of being Mau Mau with little or no proof. Despite the pressure, I felt as determined as ever. In my mind, I had no doubt that I was fighting for a just cause.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*a Kenyan nationalist and independence leader</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Wambui Otieno, Kenyan activist, description of her participation in the Mau Mau uprising against British rule in Kenya in the early 1950s, included in an autobiography published in 1998</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The settlement of the conflict divided former German and Japanese colonies among the victorious Allied powers.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The racist ideology of the German Nazi regime spread in influence as a result of its early military success.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The defeat of the Axis powers required the Allies to grant political concessions in order mobilize colonial populations militarily and economically.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Allied Western European states began to implement more active measures to intervene in the economy through the creation of extensive welfare states.</p>"],"answer":2}]
