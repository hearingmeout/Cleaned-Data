Their only alternative was to leave Brazil for Coimbra University [in Portugal], where one hundred of the sons of the colonial Brazilian elite studied law or medicine during the colonial period. Even Coimbra was a very narrow window onto the intellectual revolution that was transforming the rest of Europe. The luckiest of the lucky young colonialists took a diversion to France, which by the early eighteenth century was caught up in the ferment of the Enlightenment.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">By the late 1700s, the . . . Portuguese influence began to lift, as the colonial elite began to produce its own literature.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">To this emerging literary tradition was added the beginnings of a popular culture. The first component—religious festivals . . . and a folklore that revolved around religious holidays—was imported from the Portuguese. . . . To this was added the Indian and African presence, which furnished the foundation for the rich tradition of popular music and dance in modern Brazil.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">In part, this evolution came about because Brazil had become richer and more important than the mother country.
