In one case, the state was, from the start of the process of national formation, already an established continuity, [most] often from the Middle Ages. These were states with their own ‘national elites’ and mature written cultural traditions. . . . For these states, the road to the modern nation was through an internal transformation . . . and the struggle to establish the modern nation was mainly a political struggle to define the nation as a community of equal citizens. . . .</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">This first type of development toward the modern nation was absent in Central and Eastern Europe. There, a different pattern was typical, [namely] that of multi-ethnic empires inhabited by many non-ruling ethnic groups. . . . Lacking not only statehood, but also written traditions in their own national language, these non-ruling ethnic groups in the multi-ethnic empires were in the most complicated situation. Their national movements had to pursue not only cultural and social emancipation and equality, but also political emancipation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Miroslav Hroch, Czech historian and political scientist, introduction to <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Discourses of Collective Identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945)</span>, academic book published in 2007</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
