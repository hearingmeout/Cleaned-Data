After work, we hardly had the strength to stand on our feet. When we worked later into the night, they occasionally gave us a yam. We then had to do our washing, fix our hair, and so on. By then it would be eleven o’clock. There was no heat even in the winter; we had to sleep huddled together to stay warm. We were not paid the first year. In the second year my parents got 35 yen,* and the following year 50 yen.</p>\n\n<p>Soon after I went to work in the factory, my younger sister Aki came to work there too. I think she worked for about two years, and then took to her bed because of illness. At that time there were about thirty sick people at the factory. Those who clearly had lung troubles were sent home right away. Everyone feared tuberculosis and no one would come near such patients. Aki was also sent home, and died soon after. She was in her thirteenth year. Aki had come to the factory determined to become a 100-yen worker and make our mother happy. I can never forget her sad eyes as she left the factory sickly and pale.</p>\n\n<p>*Japanese currency</p>\n\n<p><strong>Document 4</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Buddhist priest from a rural area of Japan from which many farm girls were sent to work in the mills, circa 1900.</em></p>\n\n<p>The money that a factory girl earned was often more than a farmer’s income for the entire year. For these rural families, the girls were an invaluable source of income. The poor peasants during this period had to turn over 60 percent of their crops to the landlord. Thus the poor peasants had only bits of rice mixed with weeds for food. The peasants’ only salvation was the girls who went to work in the factories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Document 5</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Tsurumi Shunsuke, Japanese industrialist, circa 1900.</em></p>\n\n<p>Where do the cheap workers come from? They all come from farming communities. People from families that are working their own land, or are engaged in tenant farming but have surplus workers, come to the cities and the industrial centers to become factory workers. Income from the farms provides for the family needs and subsistence of the parents and siblings. The person who takes employment in the factory is an unattached component of the family. All he or she has to do is earn enough to maintain his or her own living. That is why the workers’ wages are low. This shows how important a force agriculture continues to be for the development of our nation’s commerce and industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Document 6</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Radhakamal Mukerjee, Indian economist, The Foundation of</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Indian Economics, 1916.</em></p>\n\n<p>For the last few decades there has been a rapid decline of the handwoven cloth industry throughout the country on account of the competition of machine manufactures. Though many still wear clothing made from cloth woven on handlooms, large numbers of handloom weavers have been abandoning their looms. The local textile industry owes its very existence, promotion, and growth to the enterprising spirit of native bankers and investors, who invest large capital as shareholders, investors, and financiers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Document 7</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Data from “Industrialization and the Status of Women in Japan,” dissertation, 1973.</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The table is titles as ‘Percentage of Female Cotton Textile Laborers, India and Japan, selected years’.
