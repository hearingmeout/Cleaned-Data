Our primary objective once the war is over should be to reach an international agreement on the total prevention of nuclear warfare. From this perspective, using nuclear weapons against Japan may easily destroy all our chances of success.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">A demonstration of the new weapon might best be made, before the eyes of representatives of all nations, in a desert or on a barren island. Then America could argue, ‘We are ready to renounce the use of these weapons in the future if other nations join us in this renunciation and agree to the establishment of an efficient system of international control.’</p><p class=\"passage_para\">If an international agreement is not concluded immediately after the first use of nuclear weapons, this will mean a flying start toward an unlimited armaments race. However, once an international peace agreement is achieved, then the technology and materials accumulated in the process of developing the weapon can be used for important peacetime developments, including power generation and mass production of radioactive materials. In this way, the money spent on wartime development of nuclear technology may benefit the peacetime development of the national economy.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">James Franck, German-born scientist developing nuclear weapons technology for the United States, report to the United States government, 1945</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">New international organizations could have only a limited effect in restraining the actions of the great powers.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The peace agreements should ensure that Germany could never threaten the stability of Europe again.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The end of the war would probably lead to a new rivalry between the victorious states.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Mass atrocities committed during the war required that states possess sufficient armaments to defend themselves in future conflicts.</p>"],"answer":2}]
