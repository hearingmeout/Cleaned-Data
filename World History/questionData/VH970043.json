The prime reason for this development was that Germany developed newer industries, while Britain continued to stress textile production. Formerly an agricultural country, the German Empire has come to be regarded as one of the leading industrial nations of the world and, in the chemical industries, Germany has for some time occupied a leading place.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">One of the most successful chemical and pharmaceutical firms in Germany is the Bayer company.

The laboratories are arranged very much in the same manner as the university laboratories in Britain. Each workstation receives a supply of electricity, compressed air, steam, and hot and cold water.
