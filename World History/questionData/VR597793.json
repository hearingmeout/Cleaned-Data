Every student of African history concedes the primacy of economic interests in the rise of the great empires during Africa’s golden age [circa 900–1400]. The historical explanations of their decline and fall have always had a strong economic orientation, but the correlation between economics and the rise and fall of empires is not a phenomenon peculiar to African history: it is a general historical phenomenon. Since the beginning of history, Africa has faced an assortment of foreign conquerors all initially driven by stories of its enormous wealth—real or imaginary—to invade the continent. Whether similar impulses drove the European conquerors of Africa in the nineteenth century has been the subject of great historical debate. . . . Economic factors, social conditions, and politics are delicately connected. The historian who discusses the one in isolation of the others does so at his peril.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Godfrey Uzoigwe, Nigerian historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Britain and the Conquest of Africa</span>, 1974</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">European imperialism in the nineteenth century can be explained exclusively through economic factors.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economic explanation of the rise of empires in Africa is incorrect.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economic explanation for the rise and fall of empires is more useful in studying African history than it is for studying other world regions.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Economic motives explain much of the motivation for imperial expansion in Africa but cannot be entirely separated from other motives.</p>"],"answer":3}]
