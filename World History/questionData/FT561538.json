And it is not a secret to whoever has looked into this matter or has come to be aware of it that those who come into contact with plague patients mostly die, while those who do not come into contact survive. And amidst the horrible afflictions that the plague has imposed upon the people, God has afflicted the people with some learned religious scholars who issue <em>fatwas</em>* against fleeing the plague, so that the quills with which the scholars wrote these <em>fatwas</em> were like swords upon which the Muslims died. In conclusion, to ignore the proofs of plague contagion is an indecency and an affront to God and holds cheap the lives of Muslims.”</p>\n\n<p>*rulings on Islamic law</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Lisan al-Din Ibn al-Khatib, A Very Useful Inquiry into the Horrible Sickness, Granada, Spain, 1349–1352</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>New understandings of the natural world during the Enlightenment </p>","<p>Daoist understandings of the balance between humans and nature </p>","<p>Greek and Roman philosophical principles of logic and empirical observation </p>","<p>Arab interactions with Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians in the pre-Islamic era </p>"],"answer":1}]
