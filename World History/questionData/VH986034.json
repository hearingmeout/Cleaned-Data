Of course, to oppose the government in a society such as ours is very different from opposing a democratic government in an open society. In a repressive society such as ours dissent must start first on the level of individual thinking and conscience, rather than actual political action. The power of our opposition to the Communist regime is, for now, a <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">potential </span>power, which is hidden throughout the whole of society. But once enough members of society have joined our ranks, then this potential power can spring forth (when, where, and under what circumstances it is difficult to predict) into something visible: a real act of political protest, a social movement, a sudden explosion of civil unrest. This is why the regime persecutes dissidents for even the most modest attempts to tell the truth.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Why was Solzhenitsyn* driven out of his own country? Certainly not because he wielded any real power or because any of the regime’s representatives felt he might unseat them and take their place in government. No—Solzhenitsyn’s expulsion was a desperate attempt to plug up a wellspring of truth which the regime feared might one day produce unpredictable consequences. They feared Solzhenitsyn because they realized that the crust of lies they have built around us is very fragile. As long as it seals off completely the entire society, it appears to be made of stone. But the moment someone breaks through in one place, when one person cries out, ‘The king has no clothes!’ then everything suddenly appears in another light and the whole system can suddenly find itself on the verge of disintegrating.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*a Soviet writer who wrote books exposing the oppressive policies of Stalinism</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovak writer and dissident, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Power of the Powerless</span>, essay written in 1978 and distributed as an underground publication in Soviet bloc countries</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The way in which squabbles among party leaders and intraparty power rivalries gradually undermined the legitimacy of communist regimes in Eastern Europe</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The way in which the mobilization of society during the Cold War gave people in Eastern Europe the strength to endure economic hardships</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The way in which the liberalization of Soviet policies following the death of Stalin allowed people in the Eastern bloc to express a wide variety of opinions and viewpoints</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The way in which government efforts to suppress criticism and restrict freedom of speech proved ineffective in stemming public discontent within communist regimes</p>"],"answer":3}]
