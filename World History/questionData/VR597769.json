For his other lands, he has contractors collecting the taxes. Like the governors, they are bound to pay him an annual sum.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">These governors and contractors have an almost absolute authority over the peasantry and nearly as much over the artisans and merchants.

This debasing state of slavery obstructs the progress of trade and influences the manners and mode of life of every individual. There can be little encouragement to engage in commercial pursuits when success merely provokes the greed of a tyrannical official who has both the power and the desire to deprive any man of his wealth. If a man manages to obtain wealth, he would rather bury it in the ground and continue to appear poor, than risk being dispossessed by the state.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\"></p><p class=\"attribution author\">François Bernier, French traveler, letter to French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, 1670</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He originally studied for a position in the Catholic Church, but then shifted to a nonreligious education.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He spent several years as an official at the Mughal imperial court.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He made extensive travels in Europe before going to India.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He wrote the description of Mughal administration at the request of Colbert, who founded the French East India Company.</p>"],"answer":1}]
