These periodic invasions by the nomads of the steppe, whose khans ascended the thrones of Changan, Luoyang, Kaifeng, or Beijing*, of Isfahan or Tabriz**, Delhi or Constantinople, became one of the geographic laws of history. But there was another, opposing law which brought about the slow absorption of the invaders by the ancient civilized lands. The civilizations of China and Persia, though conquered, would in the long run vanquish their conquerors, intoxicating them with the pleasures of settled life, lulling them to sleep, and assimilating them culturally. Often, only fifty years after a conquest, the culturally Sinicized or Persianized former barbarian would be the first to stand guard over his adopted civilization and protect it against fresh nomadic onslaughts.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*capital cities of various Chinese dynasties</p><p class=\"passage_para\">**capital cities of various Persian dynasties</p><p class=\"attribution author\">René Grousset, French historian of Central Asia, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia</span>, 1939</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">a revival of trade on the overland Silk Roads</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">transfers of scientific and technological knowledge</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the initial diffusion of Buddhism and Christianity to East Asia</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">the spread of pathogens across Eurasia, including the bubonic plague</p>"],"answer":2}]
