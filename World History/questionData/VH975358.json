He could submit all opinions to his own reason and use that reason to search for truth. Every man learned with pride that nature had not forever condemned him to base his beliefs on the opinions of others or the superstitions of antiquity.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Thus developed an understanding that the natural rights of man are inalienable and cannot be forfeited and a strongly expressed desire for freedom of thought, trade, and profession. There also developed a desire to alleviate people's suffering, to eliminate all criminal laws against political dissenters, and to abolish torture. A desire arose for a milder system of criminal legislation that could give complete security to the innocent. All of these principles gradually filtered down from philosophical works to every class of society whose education went beyond basic literacy. These principles became the common faith of all people.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Marquis de Condorcet, French nobleman and philosopher, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind</span>, published in 1794</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">In some cases, governments need to stifle freedom of speech.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Religion has been a force holding back the progress of humanity.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Man’s natural condition is one of suffering and a struggle for survival.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Loyalty to one’s nation is the greatest virtue a person can aspire to have.</p>"],"answer":1}]
