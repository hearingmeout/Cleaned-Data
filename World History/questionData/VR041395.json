But recently, people have been going to extremes by embracing a foreign civilization whose only values are fact-gathering and technical-skill. These values bring harm to our customary ways. We try to incorporate the best features of foreigners in order to achieve the lofty goals that the Meiji emperor desires. We have tried to abandon the undesirable practices of the past and learn from the outside world. But these policies have had a serious defect. They have reduced benevolence, justice, loyalty, and filial piety to secondary goals. If we indiscriminately imitate foreign ways, our people will forget the great principles governing the relations between ruler and subject and the relations between father and son.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Motoday Nagazane, adviser to the Meiji emperor, treatise written following a tour of Japanese schools with the emperor, 1879</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Renaissance</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Protestant and Catholic Reformations</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Enlightenment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Scientific and Industrial Revolutions</p>"],"answer":3}]
