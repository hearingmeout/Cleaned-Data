Victory no longer goes to him who was the strongest, the best able to endure hardship, or committed the most atrocities.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">By contrast, the basis of our modern civilization is good upbringing and the refinement of morals through the development of literary knowledge, courtesy, and compassion for the oppressed, all of which women are better at. So all our doctors and scientists who exalt man’s strong muscles, his wide skull, his long arm-to-body ratio and the like, miss the point entirely. Those physical facts, while undeniable, no longer grant man preference over woman in modern civilization.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Letter from an anonymous female reader to the Egyptian journal <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Al-Hilal</span>, 1894</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Physical differences between genders and racial groups were used to justify the denial of rights to women and non-Europeans.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The achievements of medieval Muslim science became known in the West, stimulating new interest in biology and medicine.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Bourgeois ideas of cultural and literary refinement became prevalent in many parts of the world.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The scientific method stressing experimentation and the collection of empirical evidence was discovered and first used.</p>"],"answer":0}]
