But I understand that, even as you did that, your troops were being mobilized against Austria-Hungary. This makes my attempts at meditation almost pointless. Nonetheless, I continued in my efforts today.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">I now receive fresh news of even more serious Russian preparations for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility for the safety of my empire forces me to take defensive and preventive measures. In my endeavors to maintain the peace of the world, I have gone to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster that is now threatening the civilized world will not be laid at my door. At this moment, you still have the power to avert war. Nobody is threatening the honor or power of Russia, and you can well afford to await the result of my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me by my grandfather on his deathbed, has always been sacred to me and I have often supported Russia in the past when she was in serious trouble.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Wilhelm II, emperor of Germany, telegram to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, July 31, 1914</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Intense nationalism, fueled by mass media, often forced the hand of military and political leaders.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Religious and cultural traditions emphasizing honor and chivalry often led monarchs to disregard the will of their people.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Regional conflicts in Europe were typically resolved by the great powers, with little attention paid to the needs of smaller states.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Because of the rise of pacifism, using force to resolve political disputes had come to be seen as immoral by most segments of European society.</p>"],"answer":0}]
