They became an inevitable part of the politics and economy of South India, finding their way into the society and even the vocabulary of the local people. The ‘<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">kumbini’</span>,* as the local populace called it, was not to be ignored. As with the rest [of the population], the spinners and weavers, the washers, the dyers and the once powerful textile-merchant guilds had their links with the company [warehouses]. Of course there were also those merchants and weavers who operated independently of the company, but their proportion was small.</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">With the establishment of the rival European companies in the seventeenth century, the lives of the weavers [of South India] no longer revolved around the temple but around the European [warehouses] and the towns [on the outskirts of European trading posts]. The weavers gradually began losing their bargaining power and independence. . . . Their creativity also suffered since they were compelled to copy mechanically the [designs] provided to them [by the companies’ officials]. Economically they were much worse off.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">*a Tamil pronunciation of the word “company”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Vijaya Ramaswamy, Indian historian, book published in 1985</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
