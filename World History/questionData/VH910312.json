I know you are a fan of the Beatles, but I must say that they are not among the most popular because they are considered out of date. It is more common here to listen to Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Yes, Queen, Wings, <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">King Crimson</span>, <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Alice Cooper</span>, <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Uriah Heep</span>, etc. I underlined those that I like the most.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The records with rock music that one can find on the black market here are quite expensive. For example, Uriah Heep’s album <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Salisbury</span> costs 70 rubles, and Paul McCartney’s album <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Ram</span> costs 50 rubles if they are new and still sealed in their original cellophane wrap. But if they have been opened they cost about half that. What are the prices like in Leningrad? We also have a quite well developed system of exchanging and sharing rock records here. Do you have one too?</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Now, about the blue jeans that I had asked you to get for me: if you manage to obtain them, how much would they cost? If the price is reasonable, I will send you a money order. OK? I gave you my sizes in the past, but in case you lost them—length is 5 or 6; waist 46 or 48.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Alexandr A. university student in Novosibirsk, the Soviet Union, letter to his friend Nikolai P., student in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), 1977</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["A black market existed in communist countries allowing for the exchange of Western consumer products.","Western clothing was popular among young people in the Soviet Union, but they rejected most other Western cultural trends.","University students cared about keeping up with the most recent trends in European and American music.","Some forms of Western culture were adopted by Soviet youth, but they rejected capitalist economic principles."],"answer":3}]
