The houses of the city are so suitable and those of the country so charming that life in those islands is altogether delightful. At one end of the city is the quarter for the Chinese merchants. There are about twenty thousand of them. It is a very curious place to see, because of the fine order in which the Chinese live. Every kind of merchandise has its own separate area, and those goods are so rare that they merit admiration.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The Spanish merchants of Manila intermix with the Chinese and the Portuguese of Macao so that they may enjoy the freedom to participate in commerce with China. The Spanish do not attempt to hide the fact that they are acting as agents for the inhabitants of Mexico and lately they have sent a great quantity of merchandise to Peru and to Mexico from Asia. The emperor of China could build a palace with the silver bars from Peru that have been carried to his country because of that traffic, without their ships having been registered, and without taxes having been paid to the king of Spain.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Jerónimo de Bañuelos y Carrillo, Spanish admiral, description of the trade of the Philippines, published in Mexico, 1638</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Chinese emperor could build a palace from all the silver that arrives from Peru.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Many Spanish merchants have successfully avoided paying taxes to the king of Spain.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Merchants of different ethnic groups seek to engage in trade with China.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The ships that Spanish merchants use are often not registered.</p>"],"answer":0}]
