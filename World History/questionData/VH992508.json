In Austria the Russians claim 50% of all Austrian industry. In Paris they fight for an arrangement that will allow Yugoslavia to dominate Trieste. In Berlin they carry on a continued press campaign against the Western world but ban our newspapers from the sector if they contain the slightest criticism of Soviet policy. They control the University of Berlin because it is in their sector and impose rigid political tests upon the student body, but they also control the schools of all sectors through the domination of the Berlin Magistrate, established before our entrance.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Thus far, it has been impossible to eliminate their Communist textbooks from the western sectors. They always appeal to the Potsdam accord* when it serves their ends and violate it when it suits their purposes. Their officers travel in our zone, marking factory equipment for dismantlement and shipment to Russia. But what they do in their zone is shrouded in mystery and there is some evidence that they are setting this equipment up, not in Russia but in Russian Germany. With millions of troops spread through the whole of Eastern Europe, they are now engaged in a press campaign against Western armies of occupation.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*an agreement reached between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union regarding the administration and occupation of Germany following the Second World War</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Reinhold Niebuhr, United States theologian and political commentator, “The Fight for Germany,” article published in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Life</span> magazine, 1946</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">By pointing out the hypocrisy of Soviet policies, he hoped to encourage a more confrontational stance on the part of the United States government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">By recounting Soviet appropriation of German industrial equipment, he wished to demonstrate the backwardness of Soviet economic development.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">By emphasizing the geographic extent of Soviet occupation, he wished to show that Soviet troops were dangerously overextended.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">By describing the effectiveness of Soviet information and press policies, he hoped to encourage the United States government to imitate them.</p>"],"answer":0}]
