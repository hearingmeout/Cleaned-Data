In Austria the Russians claim 50% of all Austrian industry. In Paris they fight for an arrangement that will allow Yugoslavia to dominate Trieste. In Berlin they carry on a continued press campaign against the Western world but ban our newspapers from the sector if they contain the slightest criticism of Soviet policy. They control the University of Berlin because it is in their sector and impose rigid political tests upon the student body, but they also control the schools of all sectors through the domination of the Berlin Magistrate, established before our entrance.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Thus far, it has been impossible to eliminate their Communist textbooks from the western sectors. They always appeal to the Potsdam accord* when it serves their ends and violate it when it suits their purposes. Their officers travel in our zone, marking factory equipment for dismantlement and shipment to Russia. But what they do in their zone is shrouded in mystery and there is some evidence that they are setting this equipment up, not in Russia but in Russian Germany. With millions of troops spread through the whole of Eastern Europe, they are now engaged in a press campaign against Western armies of occupation.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*an agreement reached between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union regarding the administration and occupation of Germany following the Second World War</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Reinhold Niebuhr, United States theologian and political commentator, “The Fight for Germany,” article published in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Life</span> magazine, 1946</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["He was concerned that Americans would be reluctant to risk a conflict so soon after the Second World War or see their recent allies as a threat.","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He was afraid that Soviet success would encourage a socialist revolution in the United States.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He feared that a new military buildup would interfere with the reconstruction of countries devastated by the Second World War.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">He wanted to prevent the United States government from enacting censorship of the press similar to the policies of the Soviet authorities in Eastern Europe.</p>"],"answer":0}]
