The answer, we must say without evasion, is no. In addition to the military considerations, there is also the political angle. It should not be forgotten that Russia and Germany are representatives of the conservative principle in the civilized world, as opposed to the democratic principle represented by England and France. From this point of view, a war between Russia and Germany, regardless of the specific issues over which it is fought, is profoundly undesirable to both sides. Such a conflict, however it ends, would entail the weakening of the conservative principle of which the two powers are the only reliable bulwarks. Moreover, one must realize that, under the precarious conditions that now exist, a general European war is mortally dangerous to both Russia and Germany, no matter who wins.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">It is my firm conviction, based on long and careful study of the multitude of subversive tendencies and movements that we are presently facing, that there must inevitably break out in the defeated country a social revolution that, by the very nature of these things, will inevitably spread to the country of the victor. In our country today, there are countless agitators telling the peasant that he should demand a gratuitous share of somebody else’s land, or the worker that he should be getting hold of the entire capital and profits of the manufacturer. War with Germany will create exceptionally favorable conditions for such agitations.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Pyotr Durnovo, Russian Minister of the Interior, memorandum to Tsar Nicholas II, February 1914</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The decline of the Western-dominated global order</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emergence of external and internal challenges that threatened the stability of imperial states</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emergence of new nation-states based on the principle of ethnic self-determination</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The use of government propaganda to mobilize national populations for conflict with rival states</p>"],"answer":1}]
