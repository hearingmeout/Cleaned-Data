The coup-maker, Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka, an ethnic Fijian, appeared on the balcony. . . . With both fists punching the air, he addressed his supporters, ‘ [Ethnic] Fijians must rule Fiji: that is God’s wish.’</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Ten years later, Prime Minister Rabuka, now a mellowed, greyer, balding man, addressed a multiracial election rally: ‘You cannot build a nation up by tearing each other down. That is why we focus on the need for us to be united—the indigenous Fijian people, [as well as] the sons and daughters and grandchildren of those who came as indentured laborers [from India], or in the following waves of business people are all inextricable parts of the new Republic of the Fiji Islands.’”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*the Fijian general elections of 1987 had brought to power a government dominated by political parties associated with Fiji’s ethnic Indian community.
