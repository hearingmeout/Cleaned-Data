But I understand that, even as you did that, your troops were being mobilized against Austria-Hungary. This makes my attempts at meditation almost pointless. Nonetheless, I continued in my efforts today.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">I now receive fresh news of even more serious Russian preparations for war on my Eastern frontier. Responsibility for the safety of my empire forces me to take defensive and preventive measures. In my endeavors to maintain the peace of the world, I have gone to the utmost limit possible. The responsibility for the disaster that is now threatening the civilized world will not be laid at my door. At this moment, you still have the power to avert war. Nobody is threatening the honor or power of Russia, and you can well afford to await the result of my mediation. My friendship for you and your empire, transmitted to me by my grandfather on his deathbed, has always been sacred to me and I have often supported Russia in the past when she was in serious trouble.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Wilhelm II, emperor of Germany, telegram to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, July 31, 1914</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Russia wanted to demonstrate to Austria-Hungary that its military forces had recovered from their defeat during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Russia was confident that its mutual defense treaties with France and Great Britain would ensure that Austria-Hungary would not dare attack it.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Russia was acting in support of Serbia, which was facing an imminent Austro-Hungarian attack following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Russia wanted to divert its people’s attention away from its pressing economic problems and stop the growth of socialist parties.</p>"],"answer":2}]
