He could submit all opinions to his own reason and use that reason to search for truth. Every man learned with pride that nature had not forever condemned him to base his beliefs on the opinions of others or the superstitions of antiquity.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Thus developed an understanding that the natural rights of man are inalienable and cannot be forfeited and a strongly expressed desire for freedom of thought, trade, and profession. There also developed a desire to alleviate people's suffering, to eliminate all criminal laws against political dissenters, and to abolish torture. A desire arose for a milder system of criminal legislation that could give complete security to the innocent. All of these principles gradually filtered down from philosophical works to every class of society whose education went beyond basic literacy. These principles became the common faith of all people.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Marquis de Condorcet, French nobleman and philosopher, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind</span>, published in 1794</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The French Revolution has advanced the principles of the Enlightenment.</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The failure to grant political rights to women is at odds with the idea of natural rights.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The economic policies of the French monarchy have been the main cause of the revolution.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The calls to reform the criminal justice system do not take into account the severity of the social problems posed by France’s high crime rates.</p>"],"answer":0}]
