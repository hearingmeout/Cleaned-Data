Eventually, I got tired of the abuse.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Out of desperation, I wrote to my aunt in Seoul, the one who had been an activist and had been arrested for the independence demonstration.

If you have two fathers, then change your name to the name of your Japanese father.’ She was furious!</p><p class=\"passage_para\">So I held out a while longer, but I couldn’t stand any more persecution. I finally changed my name to Otake. The ‘O’ in Korean is the first syllable of the place where I was born. The ‘take,’ meaning bamboo, is for the huge bamboo grove behind our house.
