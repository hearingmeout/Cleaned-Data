China’s past backwardness was due to its closed-door policy [to trade]. After the founding of the People’s Republic, we were blockaded by others and so the country remained closed to some extent, which created great difficulties for us.

Thus, foreign investment will serve as a major supplement to the building of socialism in our country.
