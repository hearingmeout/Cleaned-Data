It is this starting point that gives Muslim political thought so different a character from that of its counterpart in the West. . . . The Muslims started with [this] conviction: [religious] truth and [political] power appeared at the same times in history and regulated the same aspects of life, more precisely all of them. . . . [By contrast], in medieval Europe, where religious authority and political power were embodied in different institutions, the disagreement over their relationship took the form of a protracted controversy over the relationship between church and state. But in the [Muslim world], religious authority and political power were embodied in a single multi-purpose institution.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Patricia Crone, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">God’s Rule</span>, book published in 2004</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
