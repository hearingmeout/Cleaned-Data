The protection of industry and education, which is a characteristic feature of Japanese administration at home, has largely been transplanted to the Korean peninsula.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The results that have followed the industrialization of Korea, for both the native population and the Japanese administration, may be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"passage_para\">1. The development of industries has increased capital in the country and helped Korean society in a general advance toward a capitalistic stage of development. 2. As a result of industrialization, the Japanese administration’s financial resources have been increased. 3. Korean mineral products are of kinds that are scarce in Japan proper and consequently there is little competition between Korean and Japanese mineral products.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Administration by Japan, the inflow of Japanese capital, and the provision of public education have all tended toward a fundamental transformation of native Korean society. The Koreans are being rapidly modernized and even their inherent seclusive nature is undergoing a marked change. Under their former corrupt rulers, the people were reduced to abject poverty and misery and resigned themselves to fatalism, having been robbed of all incentives to earn and save money. Under Japanese government, however, the Korean people have begun to be active and industrious once again.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Tadao Yanaihara, Japanese economist, “Problems of Japanese Administration in Korea,” article published in a Canadian journal, 1938</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">They show that some members of the Japanese elite sought to join larger regional trade organizations in order to expand Japan’s economy.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">They show that some members of the Japanese elite feared the growth of communist influence in Asia after the Russian Revolution and Chinese Civil War.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">They show that some members of the Japanese elite sought to justify aggressive Japanese colonial efforts in China and the Pacific region.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">They show that some members of the Japanese elite feared Western influence would disrupt Japan’s traditional Shinto cultural and political practices.</p>"],"answer":2}]
