Since no more towns remained to conquer and since they had so many Indian slaves, they devoted themselves to seeking riches from silver mines. One of these soldiers was Juan de Tolosa, who happened to have an Aztec among his Indian slaves. The Aztec, it is said, seeing his master so anxious to discover mines and to claim silver, told him: ‘If you so desire this substance, I will take you where you can fill your hands and satisfy your greed with it.’</p>\n\n<p>The city houses at least 600 White residents, and most of them are Spaniards.
