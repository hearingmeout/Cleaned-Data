China is the biggest example, of course, and North Korea the most dreadful one, but dozens of countries, from Vietnam and Cuba to Morocco and Malaysia, have significant elements of the Cold War built into their systems of government. Many regions of the world still live with environmental threats, social divides, or ethnic conflicts stimulated by the last great international system.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Odd Arne Westad, Norwegian historian,<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> The Cold War: A World History</span>, 2017</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
