The Chilean air force has bombed most of the radio towers. My words do not have bitterness but disappointment. May they be a moral punishment for those in the armed forces who have betrayed their oaths.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">I say to the workers: I will not resign!</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Workers of my country: I want to thank you for the loyalty that you always have shown to a man who gave his word that he would respect the constitution and the law. At this definitive moment—the last moment that I can address you—I hope that you learn this lesson: foreign capital, imperialism, and the reactionary forces of Chile created the climate in which the armed forces of Chile—with foreign assistance—retook power for those forces in order to continue defending their profits and privileges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Go forward knowing that sooner rather than later, avenues will open again where free men will walk to build a better society.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Salvador Allende, president of Chile, farewell address during a military coup, 1973</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
