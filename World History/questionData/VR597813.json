By contrast, the basis of our modern civilization is good upbringing and the refinement of morals, through the development of literary knowledge, courtesy, and compassion for the oppressed. This is something that women are better at. So all our doctors and scientists who exalt man’s strong muscles, his wide skull, his long arm-to-body ratio and the like, miss the point entirely. Those physical facts, while undeniable, no longer grant man the right of preference over woman in regard to modern civilization.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Letter from an anonymous female reader to the Egyptian journal <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Al-Hilal</span>, 1894</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The abolition of the veil following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The expansion of mass public education for both boys and girls</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The growing popular support for parliamentary forms of governance</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The spread of intellectual and political debates informed by Enlightenment ideas</p>"],"answer":3}]
