Victory no longer goes to him who was the strongest, the best able to endure hardship, or committed the most atrocities.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">By contrast, the basis of our modern civilization is good upbringing and the refinement of morals through the development of literary knowledge, courtesy, and compassion for the oppressed, all of which women are better at. So all our doctors and scientists who exalt man’s strong muscles, his wide skull, his long arm-to-body ratio and the like, miss the point entirely. Those physical facts, while undeniable, no longer grant man preference over woman in modern civilization.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Letter from an anonymous female reader to the Egyptian journal <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Al-Hilal</span>, 1894</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Muslim religious scholars</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Rural peasants</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The urban middle class</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The landed aristocracy</p>"],"answer":2}]
