This only proves that newspaper articles are not written by slaves. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">The legal position of slaves in Brazil can be summed up in these words: the Constitution does not apply to them. Our [1824] Constitution is full of lofty ideas [such as]: ‘No citizen can be forced to do anything except as required by law;’ ‘The law shall apply equally to every person;’ ‘Whipping, torture, and all other cruel punishments are abolished,’ etc. Yet, in this ostensibly free nation . . . we must have, on a daily basis, judges, police, and, if need be, the army and navy employed to force enslaved men, women, and children to work night and day without any compensation. To admit this in the highest law of the land would reduce the list of Brazilian freedoms to a transparent fraud. For this reason the Constitution does not even mention slaves or attempt to regulate their status.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Joaquim Nabuco, Brazilian writer and political activist, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Abolitionism</span>, book published 1883</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Urban middle-class families increasingly relied on the labor of slaves as more women joined the workforce.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Cash-crop plantation agriculture remained an important part of some nations’ economies.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Constitutions in the Americas continued to expressly deny citizens the legal rights that had long been established in Europe.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Railroads, steamships, and other technologies greatly facilitated new migration to the Americas.</p>"],"answer":1}]
