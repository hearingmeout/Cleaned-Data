He has noticed the increasing conflict between the different sects of Muslims on the one hand and the Jews and the Hindus on the other—the sagacious mind of His Excellency then decided to arrange the translations of the sacred books of all the communities in the empire, so that with the blessing of the most revered and perfect soul of the age, they both refrain from indulging in hostility and disputes.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Abu’l Fazl ibn Mubarak, grand vizier to the Mughal emperor Akbar, introduction to a Persian translation of the <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Mahabharata</span>, a Hindu sacred text, sixteenth century India</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
