the country changed direction with lightning speed, and set off in pursuit of Western Civilization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Behold! The downfall of our traditional society took place a mere ten years or so ago. Behold! The establishment of a parliament is already about to take place in the near future. Our formerly slave-like commoners have risen in status, while their former samurai masters have fallen in status. Already the two groups are coming to meet on an equal footing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">For this reason, we should not call this the transformation of Japan, but the regeneration of Japan. The old Japan has already died and what exists in the present day is a new Japan.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Document 3</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: Chikanobu Toyohara, Japanese painter, woodblock print showing fashionable elite Meiji-era women and girls, 1887.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a traditional woodblock print from 1887 that shows three fashionable, elite Meiji-era women and a girl.

I knew only the old customs and thought of them as natural. At the women’s school I attended, we were taught that to submit to one’s husband was a quality of unsurpassable virtue in women.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Yet, during the first two or three years following my own arranged marriage, a strong sense of indignation on behalf of young women began to stir in me. I always kept new publications on the topic near me and pored over them between tasks around the house. I began to understand that Japanese women had the right to seek the freedom and fulfillment that are their due.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">I began to write occasionally on these difficult subjects and send my writings to various journals and newspapers. I also decided to try and guide my husband so that he might change his ways. But, whenever I tried to speak about these things, he would interrupt me, dismissing my arguments. Though sorry to do so, I decided to leave him. Since then, I have dedicated myself solely to the betterment of society through writing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Document 6</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: “On the Spirit of Chivalry,” Editorial in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Yorozu Choho</span>, the most widely circulated newspaper in Japan, 1898.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In the feudal times of yore, our people cherished justice, helped the weak and held the strong to account. If they saw someone else in distress or danger, they shied away neither from fire nor from water to help them but sacrificed their lives without regret.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">But our own age could not be more different. It is marked by blind egotism, as expressed in phrases such as “the strong win, the weak lose” that show a mean, merchant-like spirit, only calculating on investment and return. How far we have come from the days of chivalry, which used to be the natural expression of the warrior spirit of the Japanese people!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">Document 7</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: Kakuzo Okakura, Japanese artist and art critic, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Book of Tea</span>, written in English and published while the author was head of the Asian Art collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, 1906.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The Japanese tea ceremony is an adoration of the beautiful among the sordid reality of everyday existence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The average Westerner will see in the tea ceremony but another example of the thousand and one oddities which, to him, mark the quaintness and childishness of the East. When will you Westerners understand, or try to understand, the East?</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">We too used to have our own misconceptions about you, but they are vanishing fast. Commerce has forced European languages on our societies. Asian youth are flocking to Western colleges to be equipped with a modern education. Some of my compatriots have adopted too much of your customs and etiquette, in the delusion that wearing starched collars and tall hats equals civilization. Pathetic and deplorable as such actions are, at least they show our willingness to seek to understand Western culture. Unfortunately, your attitude remains unfavorable to understanding the East.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
