The European nations, for all their differences, are united like a single country in their attitude towards the non-Europeans. If, for instance, the Mongolians threatened to take a piece of European territory, all the European countries would make common cause to resist them.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">But Japan cannot stand alone. She would be bankrupt in competition with a united Europe, and she could not expect support in Europe. It is natural that she should seek it in Asia, in association with a free China, Thailand, and, perhaps, in the ultimate course of things, a free India. An associated Asia would be a powerful force. Of course, that is to look a long way ahead, and there are many obstacles in the way, notably the absence of a common language and the difficulty of communication. But—from India through Thailand to Japan—we are, I believe, kindred peoples, having in common possession so much religion, art, philosophy.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Rabindranath Tagore, Indian poet and Nobel Prize in Literature recipient, excerpt from a speech given while on a tour of Japan, 1916</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Japanese imperial expansion into Asian territories such as Taiwan and Korea</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Resistance to modernization by traditional Japanese elites</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Meiji Japan’s success in developing an industrial economy</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The adoption of a parliamentary political system</p>"],"answer":0}]
