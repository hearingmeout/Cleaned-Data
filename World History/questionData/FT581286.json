At the time of the discovery of the silver, there were many forests and woodlands in this rocky land, all of which have since vanished so that now except for some little wild palms, no other trees remain. Firewood is very expensive in the city because it is brought in carts from a distance of eighteen hours away.</p>\n\n<p>The silver was discovered in the year 1540, in the following way: after the fall of the Aztec Empire, Spanish soldiers remained, spread over the entire country. Since no more towns remained to conquer and since they had so many Indian slaves, they devoted themselves to seeking riches from silver mines. One of these soldiers was Juan de Tolosa, who happened to have an Aztec among his Indian slaves. The Aztec, it is said, seeing his master so anxious to discover mines and to claim silver, told him: ‘If you so desire this substance, I will take you where you can fill your hands and satisfy your greed with it.’</p>\n\n<p>The city houses at least 600 White residents, and most of them are Spaniards. There are about 800 Black slaves and mulattoes*. There are about 1,500 Indians in the work gangs who labor in all types of occupations in the mines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">Alonso de la Mota y Escobar, Bishop of Guadalajara, Mexico, geographical treatise, 1605</p>\n\n<p>*a person of mixed European and African ancestry</p>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p>The dependence of colonial economies on coerced labor</p>","<p>The social tensions that gave rise to the Latin American wars of independence</p>","<p>The development of indentured servitude as an alternative to slavery</p>","<p>The emergence of syncretic religious belief systems, such as Santería and Candomblé</p>"],"answer":-1}]
