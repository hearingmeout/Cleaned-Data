These periodic invasions by the nomads of the steppe, whose khans ascended the thrones of Changan, Luoyang, Kaifeng, or Beijing*, of Isfahan or Tabriz**, Delhi or Constantinople, became one of the geographic laws of history. But there was another, opposing law which brought about the slow absorption of the invaders by the ancient civilized lands. The civilizations of China and Persia, though conquered, would in the long run vanquish their conquerors, intoxicating them with the pleasures of settled life, lulling them to sleep, and assimilating them culturally. Often, only fifty years after a conquest, the culturally Sinicized or Persianized former barbarian would be the first to stand guard over his adopted civilization and protect it against fresh nomadic onslaughts.”</p><p class=\"passage_para\">*capital cities of various Chinese dynasties</p><p class=\"passage_para\">**capital cities of various Persian dynasties</p><p class=\"attribution author\">René Grousset, French historian of Central Asia, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia</span>, 1939</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["Invading armies establishing and maintaining a separate community, as illustrated by the European crusader kingdoms in the Middle East","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Merchants establishing diasporic communities and introducing their own traditions into the indigenous cultures, as illustrated by South Asian Muslim merchants spreading Islam to the islands of Southeast Asia</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Settled societies successfully resisting nomadic encroachments, as illustrated by the Mamluks of Egypt defeating the Mongols or Muscovy expelling the Golden Horde from Russia</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Conquering states fragmenting into several units because of political and social friction, as illustrated by the breakup of the Mongol Empire into individual khanates</p>"],"answer":0}]
