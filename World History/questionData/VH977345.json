A key indicates that a solid line represents the Boundary of the Coalfield, a dotted line represents the Principal Tramroads, and a dashed line represents Canals. In the bottom right corner of the map a scale indicates the distance of 10 kilometers. A compass on the map indicates that north is up. The Atlantic Ocean is in the bottom right corner of the map. The cities of Cardiff, Newport, Pontypool, and Merthyr Tydfil are indicated. Cardiff and Newport are on the coast in the lower right part of the map, with Newport to the northeast of Cardiff. Pontypool is north of Newport. Merthyr Tydfil is north of Cardiff and northwest of Pontypool. The coalfield boundary starts on the left side of the map and moves to the right across most of the map, passing north of the coastal cities of Cardiff and Newport. It then curves upward to Pontypool, continues upward, and then curves back to the left, passes through Merthyr Tydfil, and ends on the left side of the map. A canal is drawn northward from Newport to Pontypool and continues going north from Pontypool. Another canal is drawn northward from Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil. Numerous principal tramroads are drawn. Several are shown going northward from Newport throughout the eastern portion of the coalfield. A tramroad is shown alongside the northern portion of the canal between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil and others are shown extending from the same canal to areas in the western portion of the coalfield.\" height=\"490\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH977343.g01.png\" width=\"455\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Tramroads were iron rail tracks that used horse-drawn wagons to carry loads of coal from the mines to the ports at Cardiff and Newport.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">cheap electrical power needed for industrial production</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">access to leisure activities for the growing middle class</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">a source for improved sanitation for the rapidly urbanizing population centers</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">a means for integrating economic activities in regional and national markets</p>"],"answer":3}]
