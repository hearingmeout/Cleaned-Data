Western and Central Asians such as Turks, Uighurs, Persians, and Tibetans, however, held high-level positions in the Yuan bureaucracy.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Tensions built between [these] ethnic groups at court and Chinese officials who felt that foreigners cared little about traditional Confucian values. Some Chinese saw Tibetans as arrogantly claiming privileged status for themselves; some criticized Muslim financial advisors for imposing too severe a tax burden on the Chinese people. Nevertheless, the Mongols united China once again, and the Chinese believed that by doing so the Yuan had won the Mandate of Heaven.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">One remarkable aspect of the Yuan dynasty was its openness to all religions.
