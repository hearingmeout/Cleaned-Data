Rising human numbers put increasing pressure on the land. Almost invariably [human] expansion caused a reduction in the quantity and diversity of vegetation or, to put it in other terms, a reduction in biomass and biodiversity. That is, sedentary cultivation depended on selection of one or a few favored plant species . . . in place of a variety of grass, shrubs, and trees. . . . Agriculture was and continues to be the single most important means by which humans change the world’s lands and its ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-right\">John F.
