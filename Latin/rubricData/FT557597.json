The discussion makes liberal use of specific, appropriate references from the Latin text, properly cited, to support the analysis and the argument.

The discussion is either not as sophisticated or well-developed as a \"6\" or not quite as well-supported with textual references. The references from the Latin, properly cited, appear confident, and the essay reflects more than casual familiarity with the passage. <br><br><strong>4</strong> - An adequate essay with limited discussion in which some of the details of Laocoon's death are identified and their effectiveness is explained. The discussion may be uneven or may be more descriptive than analytical.
