The number and case of a noun are indicated by the noun's specific endings, which are dictated by what group-called a declension-the noun belongs to. Declensions sometimes, but not always, identify the noun's gender as well.","410564":"GRAM-1.B: A noun in the nominative case can show the subject of a verb.","410565":"GRAM-1.C: When a verb connects two ideas, both are usually in the nominative case.","410566":"GRAM-1.D: Most nouns in the genitive case show the possessor, to whom something belongs (e.g., \\(\\textit{villa amici}\\): my friend's house).","410567":"GRAM-1.E: The genitive case can be used to show descriptive properties of something (e.g., \\(\\textit{femina magnae sapientiae}\\): a woman of great wisdom), show the whole of which a noun is a part (e.g., \\(\\textit{plus vini}\\): more wine), or show a quasi-object of a noun implying action (e.g., \\(\\textit{cupiditas regni}\\): desire for a kingdom).","410568":"GRAM-1.F: Nouns in the dative case show the person to whom, for whom, or to whose advantage the action is being done. These nouns can be used with verbs of speaking, giving, and showing and can be translated as \"to ____\" or \"for ____.\"","410569":"GRAM-1.G: A noun in the dative case (e.g., \\(\\textit{usui}\\)) can show purpose, often paired with a dative of reference in a double dative construction.","410570":"GRAM-1.H: A noun in the dative case can be used with a form of \\(\\textit{sum}\\) to show possession or \\(\\textit{desum}\\) to show lack of possession.","410571":"GRAM-1.I: A noun in the accusative case can be the direct object of a verb; it is the noun receiving the action of a verb.","410572":"GRAM-1.J: The accusative case can show how long something happens (e.g., \\(\\textit{multos annos}\\): for many years).","410573":"GRAM-1.K: Nouns in the ablative case have a variety of functions. These nouns most commonly show the means by which an action is done, by whom an action is done, the manner in which an action is done, where or when an action takes place, or the separation between people or things.","410574":"GRAM-1.L: A noun in the ablative case, translated as \"in ____,\" \"in respect to ____,\" or \"in regard to ____,\" can show in what respect a statement may be true.","410575":"GRAM-1.M: The ablative case with an adjective can show description of a noun and is often translated \"with ____\" or \"of ____\" (e.g., \\(\\textit{vir animo bono}\\): a man with a good mind).","410576":"GRAM-1.N: The ablative case can accompany a comparative adjective (or, rarely, a comparative adverb) and is translated as \"than ____\" to show the thing against which another thing is being compared.","410577":"GRAM-1.O: A noun and participle in the ablative case form an ablative absolute and can show the time or circumstance of an action. Rarely, the participle can be replaced by a second noun.","410578":"GRAM-1.P: The nouns \\(\\textit{causa}\\) and \\(\\textit{gratia}\\) in the ablative case can follow nouns in the genitive case. In this use, both are translated as \"for the sake of.\"","410579":"GRAM-1.Q: Some nouns, especially the names of cities, can use the locative case to show location and are translated \"at ____\" or \"in ____\" (e.g., \\(\\textit{Romae}\\): in Rome). Nouns that use the locative case show where something goes to (\"place to where\") with the accusative case without a preposition (e.g., \\(\\textit{Romam}\\): to Rome), and where something comes from (\"place from where\") with the ablative case without a preposition (e.g., \\(\\textit{Romā}\\): from Rome).","410580":"GRAM-1.R: The vocative case is used to identify the person or object being addressed (e.g., \\(\\textit{Musa, mihi causas memora}\\), where Vergil is addressing the Muse).","410581":"GRAM-2: Describe how Latin verbs and verbals function in context and contribute to the meaning of the text.","410582":"GRAM-2.A: The person, number, tense, voice, and mood of a verb are indicated by a combination of its stem and ending. The specific endings are dictated by what group-called a conjugation-the verb belongs to. Irregular verbs (e.g., \\(\\textit{sum}\\), \\(\\textit{esse}\\)) do not follow the expected patterns of a conjugation. Additionally, forms of \\(\\textit{sum}\\), \\(\\textit{esse}\\) are sometimes omitted and must be inferred from context.","410583":"GRAM-2.B: The indicative mood of verbs is used for statements of fact or reality.","410584":"GRAM-2.C: There are six tenses of verbs in the indicative mood: present (____[s], is/are ____ing), imperfect (was/were ____ing, used to ____), future (will ____), perfect (____ed, has/have ____ed, did ____), pluperfect (had ____ed), and future perfect (will have ____ed).","410585":"GRAM-2.D: When \\(\\textit{ut}\\) introduces a clause with an indicative verb the \\(\\textit{ut}\\) is translated \"like,\" \"as,\" or \"when.\"","410586":"GRAM-2.E: The subjunctive mood has many uses: commands, conditions, wishes, possibility, and dependent clauses. A subjunctive in the main clause can be translated as \"may ____,\" \"might ____,\" \"would ____,\" \"should ____,\" \"let ____,\" and \"I wish that ____.\"","410587":"GRAM-2.F: Clauses introduced by question words and having verbs in the subjunctive mood are called indirect questions.","410588":"GRAM-2.G: Clauses introduced by \\(\\textit{ut}\\) and having verbs in the subjunctive mood show the result of an action and are called result clauses. Adjectives and adverbs expressing degree like \\(\\textit{adeo}\\), \\(\\textit{ita}\\), \\(\\textit{sic}\\), \\(\\textit{tam}\\), \\(\\textit{tantus}\\), \\(\\textit{tot}\\), \\(\\textit{talis}\\), etc., can be found in the main clause of many sentences with these clauses. Other result clauses can follow verbs such as \\(\\textit{accidit}\\), \\(\\textit{fit}\\), and \\(\\textit{efficit}\\).","410589":"GRAM-2.H: Clauses introduced by \\(\\textit{ut}\\) or \\(\\textit{ne}\\) and having verbs in the subjunctive mood can show the purpose of the action of the main clause and are called purpose clauses. Clauses introduced by many verbs expressing a commanding action (e.g., \\(\\textit{impero}\\), \\(\\textit{persuadeo}\\)) can show a command relayed indirectly.","410590":"GRAM-2.I: Conditions in Latin are introduced by \\(\\textit{si}\\) (\"if\"), \\(\\textit{nisi}\\) (\"if not\"), and sometimes \\(\\textit{ni}\\) (\"not\"). The verb in either part of the condition may be in either the subjunctive or indicative mood.","410591":"GRAM-2.J: The imperative mood of verbs is used for commands.","410592":"GRAM-2.K: Verbs can have two voices, reflecting how the subject interacts with the action of the verb. The active voice is used when the subject of the verb is doing the action. The passive voice is used when the action is being done to the subject. Each voice is formed differently.","410593":"GRAM-2.L: Some verbs, called deponent verbs, have passive forms in Latin but are translated into English with active meanings. Deponent verbs are often listed with three principal parts that look passive (e.g., \\(\\textit{orior}\\), \\(\\textit{oriri}\\), \\(\\textit{ortus sum}\\)).","410594":"GRAM-2.M: The infinitive is used with certain verbs (e.g., \\(\\textit{possum}\\), \\(\\textit{volo}\\), \\(\\textit{licet}\\)) and is often translated as \"to _____.\"","410595":"GRAM-2.N: A verb of speaking, thinking, feeling, etc., can introduce an indirect statement, with an accusative case noun as its subject and an infinitive as its verb.","410596":"GRAM-2.O: A gerund is a noun formed from a verb (e.g., \\(\\textit{bellandi}\\): of waging war). Like the gerund, a gerundive is an adjective formed from a verb, and it modifies a noun (e.g., \\(\\textit{ad eas res conficiendas}\\): for preparing these things).","410597":"GRAM-2.P: A gerundive (often but not always with a form of the verb \\(\\textit{sum}\\), \\(\\textit{esse}\\)) can show necessity or obligation. A dative case noun can be used to show the agent of the action in this passive construction.","410598":"GRAM-2.Q: A supine is a fourth declension verbal noun ending in -\\(\\textit{um}\\) or -\\(\\textit{u}\\). The supine ending in \\(\\textit{-u}\\) is used after adjectives and is translated with \"to ____\" (e.g., \\(\\textit{horribile visu}\\): horrible to see).","410599":"GRAM-2.R: Participles can also describe nouns and are verbal adjectives that modify nouns. Like adjectives, they agree with nouns in case, number, and gender. Like verbs, they have a tense and a voice, and they may have objects.","410600":"GRAM-2.S: There are special verbs that govern nouns in the dative (e.g., \\(\\textit{persuadeo}\\), \\(\\textit{impero}\\), \\(\\textit{propinquo}\\), \\(\\textit{credo}\\)), ablative (e.g., \\(\\textit{potior}\\), \\(\\textit{utor}\\)), or genitive (e.g., \\(\\textit{obliviscor}\\), \\(\\textit{potior}\\)) cases. These nouns are often translated into English as the direct objects of these verbs.","410601":"GRAM-3: Describe how Latin adjectives and pronouns function in context and contribute to the meaning of the text.","410602":"GRAM-3.A: Adjectives describe nouns and agree in gender, number, and case with the nouns they are describing. Adjectives usually modify an explicitly stated noun but may also modify an implied noun, when the adjective is used substantively. Adjectives occur in only the first three declensions but may modify nouns in any declension. Like nouns, an adjective's gender, number, and case are indicated by its specific ending.","410603":"GRAM-3.B: Superlative adjectives show the highest degree of the word and are often translated \"____est\" or \"very ____.\" The superlative degree of an adjective is indicated by its stem.","410604":"GRAM-3.C: Comparative adjectives show a comparison between two words and are often translated \"____er,\" \"more ____,\" or \"rather ____.\" The comparative degree of an adjective is indicated by its stem.","410605":"GRAM-3.D: Like nouns, pronouns have a gender, number, and case, which are indicated by a specific form.","410606":"GRAM-3.E: The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun it refers to and takes the place of. This antecedent may be named earlier or simply be understood in the context. A pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent.","410607":"GRAM-3.F: Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun \\(\\textit{qui}\\), \\(\\textit{quae}\\), \\(\\textit{quod}\\). Like other pronouns, the antecedent of the relative pronoun is the noun it refers back to and gives more information about. The relative pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent, but its case is determined by its use in the relative clause.","410608":"GRAM-3.G: The relative pronoun can be used in Latin as a demonstrative pronoun and can be translated in English as \"this,\" \"that,\" \"these,\" or \"those,\" instead of \"which\" or \"who.\"","410609":"GRAM-4: Describe how Latin particles (such as adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions) function in context and contribute to the meaning of the text.","410610":"GRAM-4.A: An adverb can modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb. The comparative adverb ends in \\(\\textit{-ius}\\), while the superlative adverb often ends in \\(\\textit{-e}\\).","410611":"GRAM-4.B: Prepositional phrases consist of a preposition and a noun, most often in the ablative or accusative cases.","410612":"GRAM-4.C: When \\(\\textit{cum}\\) introduces a clause, it may be translated \"when,\" \"since,\" or \"although,\" among other acceptable translations.","410613":"GRAM-4.D: Questions in Latin are typically introduced by interrogative words or the suffix \\(\\textit{-ne}\\) placed on the first or most important word of the question.","410614":"1.C: Summarize Latin texts in English.","410615":"SUM-1: Summarize a Latin text's explicit meaning. The summary may contain, for example, a description of the ideas in the text, the setting of the text, and the sequence of events in the text.","410616":"SUM-2: Summarize a Latin text's implied meaning based on figurative language and inferences.","410617":"1.D: Translate Latin texts into English.","410618":"TRAN-1: Provide a translation of a text from Latin to English using idiomatic English.","410619":"TRAN-2: Provide a literal translation of a text from Latin to English accounting for every word in the original Latin.","410620":"Skill Category 2: Describe the style and context of Latin poetry and prose.","410621":"2.A: Describe features and functions of stylistic elements in Latin texts.","410622":"STYL-1: Describe the use of repetition as a stylistic device in Latin texts.","410623":"STYL-1.A: An author may repeat words or phrases for a variety of rhetorical or poetic effects. This can be done to stress the importance of an idea, to make a statement more memorable, or to give the text a more rhythmic, and at times musical, effect.","410624":"STYL-1.B: Alliteration is the repetition of the same initial consonant sound in successive words. This type of repetition may be used to draw attention to an idea, give the text a pleasant rhythmic quality, or reinforce an emotion or sensory element communicated by the text.","410625":"STYL-1.C: Anaphora is the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive phrases, clauses, sentences, or lines. This type of repetition may be used to emphasize ideas and create a sense of momentum.","410626":"STYL-1.D: Parallel structure (also called parallelism) is the repetition of phrases, clauses, or sentences. This repetition may create a sense of balance between ideas, give emphasis to an idea, or establish a relationship between ideas.","410627":"STYL-2: Describe the use of word order as a stylistic device in Latin texts.","410628":"STYL-2.A: Chiasmus is a rhetorical figure in which two corresponding pairs are arranged not following a regular order but in inverted order (a-b-b-a). Chiasmus creates emphasis in speech, calling the reader's or listener's attention to that point.","410629":"STYL-2.B: To create an unexpected or emphatic moment in a text, an author may change the natural word order by using interlocking word order, also known as synchysis, with elements placed in an a-b-a-b format.","410630":"STYL-2.C: To create suspense or emphasis, an author may choose to delay the final word of a phrase, clause, or sentence to the beginning of the following poetic line. This delay is called enjambment.","410631":"STYL-3: Describe the use of similes and metaphors as stylistic devices in Latin texts.","410632":"STYL-3.A: A simile is a rhetorical figure, in which an explicit comparison is made between two things, usually using \"like\" or \"as\" as connecting words. Similes tend to be used in descriptive passages and help make images more vivid or clear to the reader or listener.","410633":"STYL-3.B: A metaphor is a rhetorical figure in which an implied comparison is achieved through a figurative use of words. The metaphor is distinguished from the simile due to it being implicit (the simile is explicit). In a metaphor, words are used not in their literal sense but in an analogous sense. Metaphors transfer meanings, create surprising and unexpected connections, and provide vivid imagery, among other effects.","410634":"STYL-4: Describe features of meter in Latin poetry.","410635":"STYL-4.A: Latin poetry is characterized by regular meter, which means one verse is formed by a somewhat predictable sequence of long and short syllables. Syllables make up feet, the basic repeating unit of poetry. Common metrical feet in epic poetry are dactyls (a long and two short syllables), spondees (two long syllables), and trochees (a long then short syllable).","410636":"STYL-4.B: Elision is the act of partially suppressing the end of a word when reading a verse. Elision occurs when the word ends in a vowel, a vowel followed by an \\(\\textit{m}\\), or a diphthong; and the next word begins with a vowel, a diphthong, or with an \\(\\textit{h}\\).","410637":"STYL-4.C: All epic poetry is composed using dactylic hexameter. Each line contains six feet, usually either dactyls or spondees. In the Vergilian form of epic poetry, the first four feet can be a dactyl or spondee, and the fifth foot is usually a dactyl. The last foot is always a spondee or a trochee.","410638":"STYL-5: Describe features of genre in Latin texts.","410639":"STYL-5.A: Epistles are a major genre of Roman literature. Several writers published either real or fictional letters (e.g., Pliny the Younger, Ovid, Seneca), while others had their private letters published by someone else after their death (e.g., Cicero). Letters can give us insight to the daily lives of Romans, but those of Pliny are also highly literary since they were heavily revised between the time they were sent to the addressee and the time they were published in his letter collection.","410640":"STYL-5.B: Epic poetry was a highly stylized, long-established genre of poetry in the ancient world. In order to claim their place in that tradition, epic poets would use the same elements that their predecessors had, while adding their own personal contribution. For example, Vergil drew inspiration for the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\) from Greek epics, namely Homer's \\(\\textit{Odyssey}\\) and \\(\\textit{Iliad}\\).","410641":"STYL-5.C: An epic poem in the Greek and Roman tradition was a long narrative in verse, which started with a proem (a preface or prologue) and an invocation to the muses, followed by the start of the plot in medias res.","410642":"STYL-5.D: In traditional epic poetry, the gods (which can be personified forces of nature) are always involved in and sometimes responsible for moving the narrative forward.","410643":"STYL-5.E: An epic poem usually follows the deeds of a hero who is helped and hindered by divine interventions and on many occasions must descend to the underworld to complete his or her quest.","410644":"STYL-5.F: Other genres of Latin literature include epigrams, historiography, love poems, didactic poetry, drama (tragedy and comedy), dialogues, oratory, ancient novels, and modern novellas.","410645":"2.B: Describe historical and cultural contexts of Latin texts.","410646":"CTXT-1: Describe references and allusions to influential people, literary works, and historical events in Latin texts.","410647":"CTXT-1.A: Vergil (70-19 BCE) composed some of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the \\(\\textit{Eclogues}\\) (or \\(\\textit{Bucolics}\\)), the \\(\\textit{Georgics}\\), and the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\). His works were well known in his lifetime by most educated Romans, and they have had a lasting influence on Western literature.","410648":"CTXT-1.B: Rome fought a series of wars of expansion with Carthage, a city on the northern tip of modern Tunisia, between 264 and 146 BCE. Known as the Punic Wars, these conflicts ended when Romans sacked the city of Carthage and took over Carthaginian territories.","410649":"CTXT-1.C: Several civil wars marked the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. Julius Caesar returned from his invasion of Gaul to wage war on Rome and establish his own dictatorship (49-45 BCE). After his assassination in 44 BCE, an alliance of three influential leaders called the Second Triumvirate marshalled their supporters to defeat the conspirators in Caesar's death at the Battle of Philippi.","410650":"CTXT-1.D: Caesar Augustus (63 BCE-14 CE), born Gaius Octavius, was the adopted son and heir of his great-uncle Julius Caesar. Struggles for power between Octavius and the other two members of the Second Triumvirate, Marcus Lepidus and Mark Antony, escalated into civil war, which culminated in Octavius's defeat of Mark Antony's and Cleopatra's armies at Actium in 31 BCE. Octavius then became the first emperor of Rome in 27 BCE.","410651":"CTXT-1.E: Augustus successfully used a variety of propaganda to support his rise to power as emperor (27 BCE). Through art, literature, coinage, and architecture he promoted the idea of his peaceful reign and a powerful, stable empire. The \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\) created a foundation legend of Rome that established Augustus's divine ancestry (as a descendent of Aeneas, the son of Venus) and preordained status as ruler, and presented Romans as fated to be rulers of the world.","410652":"CTXT-1.F: Pliny the Younger (61-c. 113 CE) was a lawyer, magistrate, and letter writer who served under the Emperor Trajan. He wrote hundreds of letters that provide insight into everyday life, the legal system, and Roman public administration in the first century CE.","410653":"CTXT-1.G: Pliny the Elder (c. 23-79 CE) was Pliny the Younger's maternal uncle. After Pliny the Younger's father died, Pliny the Elder took part in his nephew's rearing and education and adopted him in his will. In addition to being an admiral in the Roman fleet, Pliny the Elder was an author and scholar who wrote the \\(\\textit{Natural History}\\), the largest single work from the Roman Empire to have survived antiquity and a model for the modern encyclopedia.","410654":"CTXT-1.H: Pliny the Younger's letters about the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius are addressed to his friend, the historian Tacitus. Tacitus (c. 56-c. 120 CE) is best known for his \\(\\textit{Annals}\\) and \\(\\textit{Histories}\\), which examined the lives of emperors and the history of the Roman Empire in the first century CE. The letters he exchanged with Pliny are one of the main sources of the little we know about his personal life.","410655":"CTXT-1.I: The Bay of Naples is located on the west coast of the Italian peninsula. Mt. Vesuvius is clearly visible from most places in the bay as it is located near the center of the land around the bay. Misenum is located at the northern end of Bay of Naples and was where the Roman navy was stationed, which is why Pliny the Elder was there as admiral. The eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE famously covered the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis, and Stabiae. Stabiae, mentioned in Pliny's letters, was south of Vesuvius and in the direct path of the ash and cinder from the eruption.","410656":"CTXT-1.J: Domitian was the emperor of Rome from 81 to 96 CE and the last member of the Flavian dynasty (consisting of his father and brother who both ruled before him). During his rule, he transferred some of the government's functions to the imperial court, tried to diminish the power of the Senate, and executed multiple senators.","410657":"CTXT-1.K: Emperor Trajan ruled the Roman Empire from 98 to 117 CE. He expanded the empire to its greatest territorial size in its history and oversaw extensive public building programs and the enactment of several social welfare policies.","410658":"CTXT-1.L: At its height, the Roman Empire encompassed nearly the entire Mediterranean Basin and beyond. It extended west to encompass the entire Iberian Peninsula, north over Britain, east through modern-day Iraq, and into southern Egypt. By the time Vergil was writing the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\) in 29 to 19 BCE, the empire included the supposed location of ancient Troy (rebuilt by Augustus as the city Ilium) and the city of Carthage. In his letters, Pliny refers to Athens and Alexandria (located in Egypt at the mouth of the Nile river), which were a part of the empire at that time in the late first century CE.","410659":"CTXT-1.M: Pliny the Younger wrote his letters to Emperor Trajan from Bithynia-Pontus, a province in the Roman Empire located on the southern shore of the Black Sea (now in Turkey). Pliny served as governor of the province from 110 to 113 CE.","410660":"CTXT-1.N: An author's life and background can inform an interpretation of a text (e.g., Vergil's patronage by Maecenas, political advisor to Caesar Augustus, probably influenced the pro-Augustan allegory of the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\)).","410661":"CTXT-1.O: An author's other works can inform an interpretation of a text, and a work as a whole can inform the interpretation of any part of it.","410662":"CTXT-2: Describe references and allusions to Roman social norms and everyday life in Latin texts.","410663":"CTXT-2.A: A Roman's social standing could be influenced by their family background, their wealth, their professional accomplishments, and their political power and connections.","410664":"CTXT-2.B: Roman citizenship granted free male citizens certain rights and protections, such as the right to a legal trial, the right to vote, and the right to run for civic office. Female Roman citizens, however, were not granted the same rights, protections, or independence (either legally or due to strongly held social norms).","410665":"CTXT-2.C: Enslaved people were considered property under Roman law and had few legal rights or protections. They often performed manual labor and domestic services, but they could also be highly educated and do work that reflected this education (e.g., as bookkeepers and physicians). Many people enslaved by Romans were captives of war or piracy and came from across Europe and the Mediterranean. An enslaved person could be freed through the process of manumission, at which point they would usually become a client of their former master. They might also receive Roman citizenship and even attain wealth and political influence, despite being barred from holding political offices. However, most people enslaved by Romans were never freed.","410666":"CTXT-2.D: The system of patronage (mutually beneficial relationships between individuals with different levels of power and influence) was a major part of Roman culture. Wealthier and more powerful patrons would provide assistance, such as legal defense and gifts of food, to their less powerful clients, who would offer political support and form part of their patron's entourage in public settings. The relationship between Pliny the Younger and Emperor Trajan was an example of political patronage, as was the relationship between Vergil and Maecenas, who was a friend and political advisor to Caesar Augustus. Thanks to Maecenas's patronage, Vergil was probably inspired (or encouraged) to craft the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\) as a pro-Augustan allegory and even include cameos of the Emperor himself.","410667":"CTXT-2.E: Like broader Roman society, Roman family structure was hierarchical and patriarchal. The head of the household, \\(\\textit{paterfamilias}\\), had the power of life and death over his entire household; although it was considered a dereliction of duty (and counter-productive) to abuse this power by being cruel or violent towards members of a household. A wealthy household typically consisted of husband, wife, children, and enslaved people.","410668":"CTXT-2.F: The Romans divided the day into 12 hours, from sunrise to sunset. The first hour would begin at sunrise; the sixth hour would be approximately midday.","410669":"CTXT-2.G: The Romans viewed their gods as allies in their everyday lives. They prayed and made offerings to household gods at shrines in their homes, and they performed public animal sacrifices to ask the gods for favor or protection. The Romans would sometimes examine the entrails of sacrificed animals looking for signs indicating the approval of the gods.","410670":"CTXT-2.H: Romans often looked for signs, good or bad, about the future in portents, omens, and dreams. They believed that bad omens could be avoided or averted, but failure to address them could lead to disaster. These prophetic signs could take a variety of forms (e.g., human speech or action, weather or celestial events, features or behavior of animals) and required careful interpretation.","410671":"CTXT-2.I: \\(\\textit{Pietas}\\) reflects the Roman ideals of reverence for the gods, loyalty to country, and devotion to parents and family. Vergil's use of \\(\\textit{pius}\\) to describe Aeneas significantly expresses this set of ideals in his religious attitude, in his patriotic mission, and in his relations with his father, son, and comrades.","410672":"CTXT-2.J: Although Roman principles evolved over time, there was a discernible Roman character evident in the writings and art of the Late Republic and Early Empire. Romans especially valued mercy, honesty, frugality, hard work, responsibility, courage, self-control, moral discernment, and ethical behavior. However, the history of Rome and individual Romans show us that they did not always live up to these values.","410673":"CTXT-3: Describe references and allusions to Greco-Roman mythology and legend in Latin texts","410674":"CTXT-3.A: The Romans practiced a polytheistic religion and thought of many of their gods as equated with deities in the Greek Pantheon. To the Romans, Jupiter was king of the gods and married to Juno, the queen of the gods and goddess of marriage. Jupiter's daughter Minerva was the goddess who presided over handicrafts and war. His son Mars was also a god of war, while his son Apollo presided over music, medicine, prophecy, and archery, in addition to being a sun god. Another son, Mercury, was the god of merchants and thieves in addition to serving as messenger of the gods.","410675":"CTXT-3.B: Saturn was Jupiter's father and was described as the god of time, wealth, and renewal who ruled over a mythical past of abundance and peace. Saturn's other sons included Neptune and Pluto. Neptune was the god of the seas and bodies of fresh water, while Pluto (also referred to as Dis Pater or simply Dis) was the ruler of the underworld.","410676":"CTXT-3.C: Venus, Aeneas's mother in the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\), was the Roman goddess of love, beauty, sexual desire, and victory. She was married to Vulcan, the god of fire, metalworking, and the forge and another son of Jupiter and Juno.","410677":"CTXT-3.D: Diana was the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and fertility. In the \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\), she was concerned for the welfare of the warrior Camilla. Diana was allowed to remain unmarried as a privilege.","410678":"CTXT-3.E: The Fates were three goddesses who controlled the destinies of humans. They dictated how long people would live, what they would accomplish, and what they would suffer.","410679":"CTXT-3.F: The Judgement of Paris is a Greek myth that refers to the dispute between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite (Juno, Minerva, and Venus to the Romans) about who was the fairest among them. They chose Paris, a Trojan prince, to judge the contest. He named Aphrodite the winner, and in return, Aphrodite caused the famously beautiful Helen, the queen of Sparta, to fall in love with him.","410680":"CTXT-3.G: The story of the Trojan War comes from Greek mythology. The Greeks went to war with Troy after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband, the king of Sparta. The siege of Troy lasted a decade, and the city finally fell due to the Greeks' trick of the Trojan Horse-a gift of a giant wooden horse statue that held Greek soldiers inside. The Trojan Horse was the idea of the Greek hero Ulysses (known as Odysseus in Greek). The \\(\\textit{Aeneid}\\) connects the Trojan War with the foundation of Rome, creating an origin story for the Romans as descendants of the Trojans.","410681":"CTXT-3.H: Dido, also known as Elissa, was the legendary founder of Carthage. She was originally the queen of Tyre (in present-day Lebanon) but fled with her supporters after her brother Pygmalion murdered her husband, Sychaeus, for his wealth. When Dido arrived with her people in northern Africa, she met Iarbas, the leader of the Gaetulians. Iarbas offered her as much land as could be covered by a piece of hide, to which Dido responded by cutting the hide into strips and encircling as much land as she could. Dido also humiliated Iarbas by rejecting his offer of marriage.","410682":"Skill Category 3: Analyze Latin poetry and prose.","410683":"3.A: Develop an interpretation of a Latin text.","410684":"INT-1: Develop an interpretation about a main idea or meaning of a Latin text.","410685":"INT-2: Develop an interpretation about an effect or purpose of a Latin text.","410686":"INT-3: Develop an interpretation about a point of view or attitude expressed by the author, speaker, or character in a Latin text.","410687":"3.B: Explain how specific evidence supports an interpretation of a Latin text.","410688":"INT-4: Cite specific Latin from the selected text that supports an interpretation.","410689":"INT-5: Explain how the cited textual evidence supports an interpretation of a Latin text.","410690":"INT-6: Explain how contextual information supports an interpretation of a Latin text.","410691":"INT-7: Explain how stylistic information supports an interpretation of a Latin text.","410692":"Assessment Purpose and Source","410693":"Formative","410694":"AP Topic Question","410695":"AP Progress Check","410696":"Formative Practice","410697":"My Question","410698":"Summative","410699":"AP Exam","410700":"AP Course and Exam Description","410701":"Summative Practice","410702":"AP Practice Exam","410703":"Practice Exam 1","414164":"Practice Exam 2","410704":"My Question","411742":"High","411743":"Partial","410730":"Vergil","410731":"Pliny","410732":"Non-Syllabus Prose Author","410733":"Non-Syllabus Poetry Author","411734":"Yes","411735":"No","410705":"MCQ: Syllabus Reading","410706":"MCQ: Sight Reading","410707":"FRQ: Short Answer","410708":"FRQ: Translation","410709":"FRQ: Short Essay","410710":"FRQ: Project Prose Passage","410711":"FRQ: Project Poetry Passage","410712":"FRQ: Project Checkpoint","411761":"Teacher Use Only","411762":"Publicly Available"},"tagById":{"410518":{"id":410518,"categoryId":25207,"label":"Course Content","description":"Course Content","parentId":null,"children":[410519,410524,410530,410537,410544,410552],"externalKey":"27.apla.0","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0"},"410519":{"id":410519,"categoryId":25207,"label":"1","description":"1: Teacher's Choice - Latin Prose","parentId":410518,"children":[410520,410521,410522,410523],"externalKey":"27.apla.0.0","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0.0"},"410520":{"id":410520,"categoryId":25207,"label":"1.1","description":"1.1: Teacher's Choice Prose, approx. 300 words","parentId":410519,"children":[],"externalKey":"27.apla.0.0.0","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0.0.0"},"410521":{"id":410521,"categoryId":25207,"label":"1.2","description":"1.2: Teacher's Choice Prose, approx. 300 words","parentId":410519,"children":[],"externalKey":"27.apla.0.0.1","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0.0.1"},"410522":{"id":410522,"categoryId":25207,"label":"1.3","description":"1.3: Teacher's Choice Prose, approx. 300 words","parentId":410519,"children":[],"externalKey":"27.apla.0.0.2","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0.0.2"},"410523":{"id":410523,"categoryId":25207,"label":"1.4","description":"1.4: Teacher's Choice Prose, approx. 300 words","parentId":410519,"children":[],"externalKey":"27.apla.0.0.3","internalName":"27-AP-Latin-Framework-27.apla.0.0.3"},"410524":{"id":410524,"categoryId":25207,"label":"2","description":"2: Pliny's Letters: Eruption of Mt.
