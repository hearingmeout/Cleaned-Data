These algorithms can be represented using written language or diagrams.","410056":"1.1.A.2: \\(\\textit{Sequencing}\\) defines an order for when steps in a process are completed. Steps in a process are completed one at a time.","410057":"1.1.B: Explain the code compilation and execution process.","410058":"1.1.B.1: Code can be written in any text editor; however, an \\(\\textit{integrated development environment (IDE)}\\) is often used to write programs because it provides tools for a programmer to write, compile, and run code.","410059":"1.1.B.2: A \\(\\textit{compiler}\\) checks code for some errors.

These errors are detected by the compiler.","410062":"1.1.C.2: A \\(\\textit{logic error}\\) is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. These errors are detected by testing the program with specific data to see if it produces the expected outcome.","410063":"1.1.C.3: A \\(\\textit{run-time error}\\) is a mistake in the program that occurs during the execution of a program. Run-time errors typically cause the program to terminate abnormally.","410064":"1.1.C.4: An \\(\\textit{exception}\\) is a type of run-time error that occurs as a result of an unexpected error that was not detected by the compiler.

An arithmetic operation that uses two <code>int</code> values will evaluate to an <code>int</code> value. An arithmetic operation that uses at least one <code>double</code> value will evaluate to a <code>double</code> value.","410083":"1.3.C.3: When dividing numeric values that are both <code>int</code> values, the result is only the integer portion of the quotient. When dividing numeric values that use at least one <code>double</code> value, the result is the quotient.","410084":"1.3.C.4: The remainder operator <code>%</code> is used to compute the remainder when one number <code>a</code> is divided by another number <code>b</code>.","410085":"1.3.C.5: Operators can be used to construct compound expressions. At compile time, numeric values are associated with operators according to operator precedence to determine how they are grouped. Parentheses can be used to modify operator precedence.
