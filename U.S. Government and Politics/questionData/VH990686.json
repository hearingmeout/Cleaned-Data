It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Martin Luther King, Jr., “I Have a Dream” speech, August 28, 1963,© 1963 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., © renewed 1991 Coretta Scott King</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["The “separate but equal” doctrine was established as Constitutionally acceptable.","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The value of “all men are created equal” was reaffirmed both in law and in American political culture.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">African Americans migrated to the South in search of the American dream.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Congress passed an amendment to the United States Constitution to include the notion of equality in American law.</p>"],"answer":1}]
