The framers of our Constitution, having revolted against tyranny, bequeathed to the nation, and to us as its citizens, a form of government with checks and balances intended to assure that we would never, as a nation, be subject to the abuses we experienced as a colony under a monarchy. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">We should appreciate that the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution was modeled on the constitutions and declarations of the states, where the separation of powers was equally observed. Mirroring our U.S. Constitution, 40 state constitutions now specify that government is to be divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The separation of powers at the state level, with an independent executive, legislature, and judiciary, is also one of the fundamental tenets of our democracy.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">What often gets lost in translation is how dynamic the competition among the branches of government has been, and how much stronger we are as a country because of that ongoing debate. It has been said that the Constitution is not just a historic document, but a living participant in who we are as a nation. Out of the continuing effort to assure the separation of powers, we have built a system of government that functions remarkably well. Although the powers ascribed to each of the three branches may sometimes appear to swing like a pendulum, we have continuously reconsidered and recentered our understanding of the authority and limitation of each of these branches.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Linda Leali, “Reflecting on the Great Gift of the Separation of Powers,” Daily Business Review, 2018</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The author of the passage views the structure of government as providing a balance between the branches of government, whereas <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist </span>51 supports the idea of a powerful executive branch.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The author of the passage views separation of powers as a limitation on the authority of government, whereas <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist</span> 51 argues in favor of using separation of powers as a means to expand the role of government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both the author of the passage and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist </span>51 argue that elections are a sufficient means to ensure good government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both the author of the passage and <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist </span>51 assert that the structure of government helps control ambitions among the branches in such a way as to promote effective government.</p>"],"answer":3}]
