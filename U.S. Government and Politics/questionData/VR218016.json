Bush became president in 2001, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the fewest regulations in the history of the federal agency. This agency was created by an act of Congress in 1970. Its main task has been to ensure safe and healthy working conditions for working men and women in the private sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">According to a 2007 <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">New York Times</span> report, the agency had eliminated dozens of existing and proposed regulations and delayed adopting others. Experts who researched the Bush administration said OSHA had imposed only one major rule between 2001 and 2007.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Instead of regulations, the director of OSHA, Edwin Foulke, said that they and other agencies favor a “voluntary compliance strategy,” reaching agreements with industry associations and companies to police themselves. He also said that he “firmly believes in limited government.” When the Democrats took control of Congress in 2007, they vowed to increase oversight of OSHA.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:1 frame:none\">\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n"}]}]
