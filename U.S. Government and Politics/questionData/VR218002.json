President Obama described Ms. Lynch’s qualifications for the position, including a 30-year career as a tough, fair, independent lawyer who twice headed one of the most prominent U.S. Attorney’s offices in the country, and noted that she had “spent her life fighting for fair and equal justice that is the foundation of our democracy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Ms. Lynch commented, “The Department of Justice was the only Cabinet Department named for an ideal.
