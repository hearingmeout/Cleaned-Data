Nothing better captured this constitutional ideal than the minuteman. Citizens had a legal obligation to outfit themselves with a musket at their own expense and were expected to turn out at a minute’s notice to defend their community, state, and eventually their nation.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">Although each side in the modern debate claims to be faithful to the historical Second Amendment, a restoration of its original meaning, re-creating the world of the minuteman, would be a nightmare that neither side would welcome. It would certainly involve more intrusive gun regulation, not less. . . . Gun control advocates might blanch at the notion that all Americans would be required to receive firearms training and would certainly look askance at the idea of requiring all able-bodied citizens to purchase their own military-style assault weapons.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Saul Cornell,<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> A Well-Regulated Militia: The Founding Fathers and the Origins of Gun Control in America</span>, Oxford University Press, 2006</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At the time the Constitution was written, laws in the states required able-bodied individuals to serve in militias.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Constitution clearly states that the Second Amendment applies only to the federal government’s ability to make gun laws.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States today uses militias such as police forces to maintain domestic peace.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Constitution guarantees that all rights, including the Second Amendment, are incorporated to the states.</p>"],"answer":0}]
