The first is a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed: a threatened Lebanonization of national states in which culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe—a Jihad in the name of a hundred narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence, every kind of artificial social cooperation and civic mutuality. The second is being borne in on us by the onrush of economic and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize the world with fast music, fast computers, and fast food—with MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald’s, pressing nations into one commercially homogeneous global network: one McWorld tied together by technology, ecology, communications, and commerce. The planet is falling precipitantly apart and coming reluctantly together at the very same moment.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Benjamin Barber, “Jihad vs. McWorld,” 1992</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Free market principles influence American political culture as well as the cultures of other countries.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States is moving toward a single religion while other countries become more religiously fragmented.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Capitalism has little influence beyond the borders of the United States because of retribalization in other countries.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Citizens in the United States have witnessed a decline in civil liberties because of the similarities between the two major parties.</p>"],"answer":0}]
