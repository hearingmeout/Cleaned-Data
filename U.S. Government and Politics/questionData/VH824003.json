The law also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent agency responsible for enforcing the law.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation fired ten workers attempting to unionize its plant located in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. When the National Labor Relations Board determined this to be in violation of the recently passed NLRA, the company sued claiming that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce, and thus Congress did not have the constitutional power to regulate it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the subsequent case, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">National Labor Relations Board </span>v.<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation</span> (1937), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the National Labor Relations Board by a 5–4 vote, holding that the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation conducted interstate commerce and that industrial labor relations affects that commerce.</p>\n"}]}]
