If, for every violent act committed against us, we respond with nonviolence, we attract people’s support. We can gather the support of millions who have a conscience and would rather see a nonviolent resolution to problems. We are convinced that when people are faced with a direct appeal from the poor struggling nonviolently against great odds, they will react positively. The American people and people everywhere still yearn for justice. It is to that yearning that we appeal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“. . . When victory comes through violence, it is a victory with strings attached. If we beat the growers at the expense of violence, victory would come at the expense of injury and perhaps death. Such a thing would have a tremendous impact on us. We would lose regard for human beings. Then the struggle would become a mechanical thing. When you lose your sense of life and justice, you lose your strength.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\"><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><em>César Chávez, “He Showed Us the Way,” 1978</em></span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The right to fair trial</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The right to assemble</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The right to bear arms</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The right to an attorney</p>"],"answer":1}]
