The law requires that all bills passed in committee be reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office to estimate the cost of the mandate, and if the law exceeds a certain amount, it cannot be sent to the chamber for a floor vote without an appropriation. Furthermore, any rules made by federal agencies also need to be reviewed for their impact on states and businesses.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:1 frame:none\">\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n"}]}]
