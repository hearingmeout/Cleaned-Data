They seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority, without a diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in the members. . . . This [requires that] a full display of the principal defects of the Confederation [is] necessary, in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building, which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric. . . . [T]he United States has an indefinite discretion to [plead for] for men and money; but they have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at their option.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Alexander Hamilton, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist</span> 15</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Articles of Confederation lacked federal executive and judicial branches, whereas the United States Constitution did not.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Articles of Confederation allowed for the federal government to request revenues from states but did not permit it to tax citizens directly, whereas under the United States Constitution the federal government could tax citizens directly.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Under the Articles of Confederation, members of the national legislature were paid by the state governments, whereas under the United States Constitution they were paid by the federal government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Under the Articles of Confederation, members of the national legislature were not able to regulate currency, whereas under the United States Constitution the federal government regulates currency.</p>"],"answer":1}]
