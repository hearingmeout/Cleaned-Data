W. Bush, Arkansas Democrat Governor Bill Clinton, and Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who ran as an independent. Despite having an approval rating of over 90 percent a year earlier, Bush's popularity steadily fell due to a weak economy. Clinton rose in the polls by focusing on the economy and by courting independents and younger voters. Perot was the charismatic wild card, with a self-financed campaign and strong support in all regions of the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Perot led in the polls as late as June, engaging new voters and receiving strong media attention. While he received 19 percent of the popular vote on election day, the highest for a third-party candidate since 1912, Perot found himself with no electoral votes when the dust settled on November 3.</p>\n"}]}]
