Unable to afford a lawyer, he was denied a public defender by a judge and forced to represent himself. He was found guilty and given an eight-year sentence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the ensuing case, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Betts</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Brady</span> (1942), the Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Betts, who claimed his constitutional right to a fair trial was denied. In a 6-3 decision, the Court held that the right to counsel applied to only criminal cases in federal courts and that he did not have a right to counsel in a state court, except in death penalty cases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Justice Black, in his dissenting opinion, reasoned, “This case can be determined by a resolution of a narrower question: whether, in view of the nature of the offense and the circumstances of his trial and conviction, this petitioner was denied the procedural protection which is his right under the federal Constitution. I think he was.”</p>\n"}]}]
