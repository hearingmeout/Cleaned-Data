The United States, as now composed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to their resolutions, either by pecuniary [fines], by a suspension or divestiture of privileges, or by any other constitutional mode. There is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against delinquent members; and if such a right should be ascribed to the federal head, as resulting from the nature of the social compact between the States, it must be by inference and construction... There is, doubtless, a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist. . .</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Alexander Hamilton, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist</span> 21</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The federal government can withhold highway funds from states that do not raise the age to drink alcohol to 21.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The federal government can place a tax on any goods that an individual regularly transports across state borders.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both the states and the federal government have the power to issue income taxes.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A constitutional amendment can be passed to override a Supreme Court decision.</p>"],"answer":0}]
