The survey also shows a clear relationship between respondents’ high school civics education experiences and their knowledge of campaign issues and political participation in the 2012 presidential election. However, taking high school civics had little or no relationship with young adults’ choice between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Young people who recalled experiencing more high-quality civic education practices in schools were more likely to vote, to form political opinions, to know campaign issues, and to know general facts about the US political system,” said Peter Levine, director of CIRCLE. “Civics education was not related to partisanship or choice of candidate. These results should allay political concerns about civic education being taught in schools.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Source: CIRCLE, 2013.</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Public opinion polling</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Partisanship</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Political socialization</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Ideology</p>"],"answer":2}]
