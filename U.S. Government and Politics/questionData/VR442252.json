The first is a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed: a threatened Lebanonization of national states in which culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe—a Jihad in the name of a hundred narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence, every kind of artificial social cooperation and civic mutuality. The second is being borne in on us by the onrush of economic and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize the world with fast music, fast computers, and fast food—with MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald’s, pressing nations into one commercially homogeneous global network: one McWorld tied together by technology, ecology, communications, and commerce. The planet is falling precipitantly apart and coming reluctantly together at the very same moment.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Benjamin Barber, “Jihad vs. McWorld,” 1992</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The expansion of democracy is seen as the primary cause of political conflict in the world.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The world is becoming more globally united but also more aware of cultural differences, which may lead to conflict.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The threat of terrorism requires cooperation, which is nearly impossible to achieve.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Consumers in other parts of the world are less excited about American commercial products such as MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald’s.</p>"],"answer":1}]
