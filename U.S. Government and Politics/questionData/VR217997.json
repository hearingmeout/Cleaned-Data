It resulted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which constituted the largest one-time tax decrease in American history.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The law lowered the rate for individuals in the highest tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. It decreased the top business tax rate from 36 percent to 21 percent. The Republicans argued that tax breaks would stimulate economic growth and lead to more innovation from the private sector. Most Democratic members of Congress were critical of the legislation, labeling it a tax break for corporations and the wealthy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Nonetheless, Republicans controlled a majority of both chambers of Congress, and each chamber voted its own version of the bill. The bill passed in the House of Representatives on November 16 with 227 Republicans voting in favor and 13 opposing it. A slightly different version of the bill passed the Senate on December 2 with 51 Republican senators voting in favor of the bill. Every Democratic legislator in both chambers voted against the bill.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:1 frame:none\">\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n"}]}]
