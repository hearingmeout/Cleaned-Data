As the internet developed, questions emerged about where internet communication takes place and the level of privacy protection email users can expect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the case <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">United States</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Microsoft</span> (2018), the federal government issued Microsoft Corporation a warrant to hand over to authorities email communications between some of its users. Federal law enforcement alleged that one of Microsoft’s email users was operating an account to facilitate illegal drug trafficking. Microsoft refused to comply with the warrant, claiming that its servers were located in Ireland and thus not within the jurisdiction of the federal government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Before the Supreme Court decided the case, Congress intervened by passing the CLOUD Act, which required internet-based companies to hand over communications requested in a warrant so long as both the federal government and the foreign government agreed. Microsoft and other internet companies accepted the new legislation, but the law raised concerns among many groups that civil liberties were being violated.</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:1 frame:none\">\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n"}]}]
