Three squiggly lines representing Democrat, Republican and Independent travel horizontally across the graph.  The dash line marked Democrat slopes upward from 41% to 53% in 1964, dips back down to 42% by 1972, moves up to 46% by 1976 and then zig-zags downward to a low point of 30% in 1990 before moving back up to 35% in 2000.  The solid line marked Republican starts at 38% shortly after 1952, moves gradually downward to 25% by 1964, stays even at 27% until 1972, then moves downward again to 21% in 1976, zig-zags upward to 32% in 1984, moves slightly down in 1986 and then back up to 32% in 1988, then drops to 28% in 1992 before climbing back up to 34% in 2000.  The dotted line marked Independent drops sharply from 26% to 19% shortly after 1952; then moves gradually upward to a peak of 32% in 1976, zig-zags horizontally until 1987 when it rises sharply to 39% by 1995, drops to 31% in 1996 but quickly moves back up to 39% in 1998 before sliding downward to 33% by 2000.\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/7d7f5118ae425d197f3609bf2ab6f97a/original.png\" width=\"506\">"}]}]
