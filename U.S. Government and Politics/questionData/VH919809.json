They seem still to aim at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an augmentation of federal authority, without a diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in the Union, and complete independence in the members. . . . This [requires that] a full display of the principal defects of the Confederation [is] necessary, in order to show that the evils we experience do not proceed from minute or partial imperfections, but from fundamental errors in the structure of the building, which cannot be amended otherwise than by an alteration in the first principles and main pillars of the fabric. . . . [T]he United States has an indefinite discretion to [plead for] for men and money; but they have no authority to raise either, by regulations extending to the individual citizens of America. The consequence of this is, that though in theory their resolutions concerning those objects are laws, constitutionally binding on the members of the Union, yet in practice they are mere recommendations which the States observe or disregard at their option.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Alexander Hamilton, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist</span> 15</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increased centralization of power in the national legislature under the Articles of Confederation</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Shay’s Rebellion, which was an armed response to the inability of the national government to address unjust economic state policies.</p>\n","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The tension between states relying on commerce and those relying on agriculture</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Passage of the Stamp Act and other taxes during the revolutionary period</p>"],"answer":1}]
