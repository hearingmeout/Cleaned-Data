As a religious custom, members practice animal sacrifice rituals. After receiving notice that a Santeria church had announced plans to expand a church in the city of Hialeah, Florida, the city government passed four public ordinances forbidding the killing of animals if the primary purpose was something other than food consumption. In <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye </span>v.<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\"> Hialeah</span> (1993), in a unanimous decision, the United States Supreme Court struck down the local ordinances as a violation of the United States Constitution. The Court stated that even though the language of the ordinances did not specifically mention the Santeria religion, they were clearly designed to target the Santeria faith and its practices."}]}]
