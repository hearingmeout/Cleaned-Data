The United States, as now composed, have no powers to exact obedience, or punish disobedience to their resolutions, either by pecuniary [fines], by a suspension or divestiture of privileges, or by any other constitutional mode. There is no express delegation of authority to them to use force against delinquent members; and if such a right should be ascribed to the federal head, as resulting from the nature of the social compact between the States, it must be by inference and construction... There is, doubtless, a striking absurdity in supposing that a right of this kind does not exist. . .</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Alexander Hamilton, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Federalist</span> 21</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The national government, by natural right, has more power than the state governments.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Separation of powers means that the national government is limited to passing only legislation that all the states want.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Under federalism, the states retain more power than the national government.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">As a practical matter, the laws of the national government ought to have supremacy over state laws.</p>"],"answer":3}]
