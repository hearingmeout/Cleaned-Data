Under net neutrality rules, companies that sell Internet services to customers must provide access to all Web sites at the same speed. Without net neutrality, Internet service companies can charge consumers or Web sites a premium for high-speed access to certain sites.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">As required by statute, the FCC opened up the proposed rule for public comment. The rule received an astonishing 21 million comments. However, a study of the comments by Pew Research showed that only 6% of the comments were unique, suggesting that the comments were part of organized campaigns and possibly generated by computer bots. For example, on nine different occasions, more than 75,000 comments were submitted within the same second. Many of the commenter names and e-mail addresses also appeared to be fake.</p>\n"}]}]
