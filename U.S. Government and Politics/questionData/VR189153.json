The post was a rare political statement from the pop star, who noted that “I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but . . . I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. . . . So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Immediately following Swift’s Instagram post, thousands of 18– 24 year olds signed up to vote. Swift added a link to the website vote.org in her bio, which lists voting procedures in various states.</p>\n"}]}]
