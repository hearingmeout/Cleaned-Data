The first is a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed: a threatened Lebanonization of national states in which culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe—a Jihad in the name of a hundred narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence, every kind of artificial social cooperation and civic mutuality. The second is being borne in on us by the onrush of economic and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize the world with fast music, fast computers, and fast food—with MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald’s, pressing nations into one commercially homogeneous global network: one McWorld tied together by technology, ecology, communications, and commerce. The planet is falling precipitantly apart and coming reluctantly together at the very same moment.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Benjamin Barber, “Jihad vs. McWorld,” 1992</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States engages in free trade agreements, which leads to the export of American businesses and influences the culture of foreign countries.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Private religious schools in the United States educate students alongside public secular schools.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Market forces set the prices on a variety of goods sold in and outside the United States, increasing global poverty abroad.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The increase in economic interdependence leads to a reduction of war and regional conflict.</p>"],"answer":0}]
