Instead, the Internet promises to create more customized relationships between candidates and supporters that could strengthen their political bonds. The success of Obama’s Internet campaign rested in part on a web presence that users could tailor to suit their needs and wishes so that they could take the initiative, if so inclined, to organize events, write testimonials, give money, volunteer, or persuade friends and neighbors about the strengths of the candidate.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">. . .
