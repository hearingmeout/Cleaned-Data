The men were arrested and during the criminal proceedings reporters for the <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Washington Post</span> alleged connections between the White House and the burglary. The Nixon administration denied any involvement and Nixon won reelection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The Senate voted unanimously on February 7, 1973, to create the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities to investigate the burglary and other Nixon campaign activities. The Select Committee was granted the power to subpoena witnesses and materials, to investigate the break-in and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as “all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct, including political espionage and campaign finance practices.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Throughout the Senate investigation, Nixon denied the committee’s requests for access to information. Nixon repeatedly declared that he knew nothing about the cover-up. The Select Committee’s final report recommended action in three areas: regulation of campaign activities and contributions, the establishment of a permanent special prosecutor, and the creation of a permanent congressional legal service.</p>\n"}]}]
