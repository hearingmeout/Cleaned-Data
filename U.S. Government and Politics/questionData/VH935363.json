It expanded the federal government’s ability to access phone and e-mail communications to an unprecedented level. It gave the FBI the authority to obtain personal information on people suspected of terror-related activities without the approval of judges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Broad support for these additional security measures led to this quick response by Congress and the president, but it also ignited a long-standing debate in American government regarding the balance between civil liberties and social order. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union launched campaigns opposing the measures and cautioning against the erosion of civil liberties in the wake of the 9/11 attack.</p>\n"}]}]
