Several people, including Shawn Eichman, burned flags on the steps of the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C., before a crowd of reporters and photographers. Eichman and others were arrested for violating the Flag Protection Act.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the ensuing cases, Eichman and others defended their actions as legitimate forms of political protest. Federal district judges dismissed the charges, but United States attorneys appealed the decisions directly to the Supreme Court. These cases were consolidated in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">United States</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Eichman</span> (1990).</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">United States</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Eichman</span> (1990), the Supreme Court’s 5–4 decision held that the federal government cannot prosecute a person for desecration of the American flag because doing so would violate the First Amendment.</p>\n"}]}]
