The goal of the legislation was to reform the welfare system so that individuals and families would be less dependent on government assistance and break the cycle of poverty.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The legislation ended the federally run Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which provided cash assistance to individuals who met specific low-income criteria and replaced it with the Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) program. TANF, in contrast to AFDC, uses grants to provide a fixed amount of funding to states each year for welfare services. The amount of money states receive from the federal government does not increase as poverty rises. States are charged with the task of determining who is eligible for TANF funding.</p>\n"}]}]
