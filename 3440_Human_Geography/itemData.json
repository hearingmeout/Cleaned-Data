Bars extend horizontally from the zero line either left or right for each 5 year period to indicate the percent of the population that is of that gender and in that age range. The bars for males are white and the bars for females are grey. The bars are approximately equal on the female and male side, and extend to 4 to 5 percent from 0 to 40 years. The higher bars get steadily shorter, decreasing to about 1 percent for the highest bar. Figure B is a population pyramid. The y-axis shows age from 0 to 90 in increments of 10 years.
