Row two: Social consequence - Increased grey power; Explanations - Seniors with more political/personal influence, social and political action on behalf of elderly, more elderly workers, shift in consumerism (e.g., tourism courses, media, entertainment). Row three: Social consequence - Increased immigration; Explanations - Increased immigration results in increased cultural diversity, perhaps social conflicts, growth of ethnic neighborhoods. Row four: Social consequence - Changing housing stock; Explanations - Homogeneous seniors' neighborhoods (e.g., smaller homes/condos, less maintenance), increased availability of homes for youth. Row five: Social consequence - Decline of services for youth; Explanations - Closure of schools, reduction in daycares. Row six: Social consequence - Need for/growth of services for elderly; Explanations - Geriatric medical/social services and facilities. Row seven: Social consequence - Social conflict due to generational differences of opinions; Explanations - Elderly may resist societal changes desired by young, elders resented for requiring excessive human/capital resources. Row eight - Social consequence - Accessibility; Explanations - Changes to building code, signage (e.g., larger font, audio messages). Row nine - social consequence - Development of pro-natalist policies; Explanations - Created to sustain population. For group two, the first column is labeled Economic Consequences and the second column is labeled Explanations. Row one: Economic Consequences - Increased cost to society due to government programs/taxes; Explanations - Medical care, housing, accessibility, pensions. Row two: Economic Consequences - Increased economic pressure on the labor force (dependency ratio); Explanations - Challenges sustaining the economy, fewer people working, fewer people paying taxis. Row three: Economic Consequences - Labor supply issue; Explanations - Shortage of labor, hiring of elderly, less competition among youth for jobs, need for increased immigration, automation. Row four: Economic Consequences - Changes in employment opportunities; Explanations - Growth of senior-based employment, Decline of youth-based employment. Row five: Economic Consequences - Economic pressure on adult children; Explanations - Financially assist their aging parents, stay at home rather than work, help pay for others to assist, help pay for nursing homes, help pay medical costs. \"></p>","af":"<p></p>"},{"l":"4 points","v":4,"m":4,"d":"<p><strong>Meets the criteria for 4 points of the following:</strong></p><p><strong>(4 points)</strong></p><p>Identify and explain one social consequence and one economic consequence that countries face as their populations age.

Factors: Increasing demand for organic products has made organic agriculture profitable and led to a growth in organic farming (both large-scale and small-scale). Explanations: Consumers in the U S book alternatives to the industrial products of modern agriculture because of (media driven) concerns about the nutrition and healthiness of commercial agricultural products, Consumers have become wary of the insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) used in agriculture and to produce foodstuffs and have become concerned about related long term health issues, Population of the US is increasing in wealth and is better able to afford (and willing to pay) higher prices for organic products, Buying organic food is an example of conspicuous consumption to display cultural preferences (a green life style), Some consumers switch to organic products because they are concerned about the humane treatment of animals, Households have declined in size and have more disposable income to I on higher-quality (organic) food rather than lower quality spend on higher (nonorganic) food, Better advertising and marketing systems have made organic products more appealing to consumers, thereby increasing the demand for goods and profitability, The demand has increased, aided by the growth of chains of supermarkets dedicated to organic products which has increased profitability and led to the growth of suppliers for those chains. 2. Factors: Shifts in organic agriculture have led to better care for the land (land stewardship, sustainability, environmental concerns). Explanations: As stewards of the land, farmers or consumers with to sustain it in the same state they found it rather than exhaust it or otherwise degrade it by the application of agricultural chemicals, Some consumers witch to organic products because they wish to eat foods that have a less negative impact on the environment (wish to live in greater harmony with nature). 3. Factors: Small farms competing with large scale farms (agribusiness) are forced to shift to more profitable agriculture. Explanations: The economies of scale achieved by large farm operations have kept the retail price of food low. Because small farm operations cannot achieve these economics, they have to either go out of business or shift to more intensive forms of agriculture or supply specialty food for niche markets that bring higher prices and greater profitability example producing higher priced higher quality organic products.\"></p><p><em>Scoring Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>For parts A and B, factor points and explanation points are independent; students can earn one without the other.</p></li><li><p>For both parts, do not award full credit for a “double dip”—e.g., two explanations of demand for organic foods.</p></li></ul>","o":[{"l":"0 points","v":0,"m":4,"d":"<p><strong>Does not meet the criteria for earning points of the following:</strong></p><p><strong>(4 points)</strong></p><p>First identify and then explain TWO factors contributing to the increase in the number of organic farms since 1970.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/89d0f92c502ad41b393ff8762b9c5325/original.png?Signature=7YdgEk99dLNui7noBqt%2FrIsYgw8%3D&amp;Expires=1628344999&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZK4H5S3WXR&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEFUaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIDmQ5fipRyBFt/cEGW/sgaCQ7iIAXqzhfUQdHW/kMs3%2BAiEAh%2BvjmX3mMjApWvv4Ecdohqj/mMTHat86UWuPtPuEMC0q%2BgMIbhACGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDCZiNyVp1/1trH1nWirXA/V8G0YLEHY1WapMcXD1R7EYCXfWT5rUGSEpQjkVEE2xplma8XNsF6RqPshaaISbO3rQi2yxeIgCA3pdii5pWRKbENhpKKwJ8qRPq6wcpHpENuY0bPckysaSBEEKpilqhREfAGt22iR%2Bof8UaTjv1SarnhDKn3qb1PZ/we4r3i4V8wXENZaxxL5a3ZbAeOEvJSS7P8cGeCH4RfwGZtSWEolMSutb9qMEzr9KctSpVdaK6Vk%2BzyaP7RgUQz%2Bi8FeWld4R5wXZazBDvJClYyXbOdpCsfvQplfRWWz1oWZyHwcDpr%2BfT58slyl/OmArCXiskjRcgkV30m7pZYLbs6tuqhqmxYWOOJOYQZRj29%2BDKGf0sATtZ0cRH%2B4eCDNepWrK3GE/oBIon5rjs4sQpKjGmKw36c03FHlWVAkr5Ue8TkNgdMRWfbV9Rb4iewpU3/e0d775HJKJ9rABww/KXsh1TP68YuUSeIcZyAVGEVD2Xrexpi8ewSrIX%2B2Y27qWA1ZyvFjXW2lRCsysq7dvuUH71gCJmP27yJYxjreJV%2B%2Bz7tNoAJ9m7q6EuNRlG9zXRYWLzkj7mAkhpptPmWVm9ijxjmMxkBYnkMv%2Bww/oG%2B5fa09awzPoOFi86zCoo7iIBjqlATlEpUAOqlOuVSsb8YP7/HjHsta/QC8oAolMa4jy8WLR2anj14QeR7GFE6f%2Bt1XjaAFiULHMOXfK2kT%2BnmNxA1lEjDMBlylYmVXdHyt9kh5/4empXXR7TjcTdPUtblhyFXp7s9Oj5KNUI1SRmYORpb8jT6f155MXnyrhF8g9/Exf7uB11NAIri7cuYIJtQ/uPoNe46ktv77Sw61Xvp3t1CqRg9ZOwA%3D%3D\" alt=\"The table has two columns and three rows.
