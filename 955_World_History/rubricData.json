The essay goes on to note (referring to Document 3 in particular) that initially communist regimes “tried to gain female popular support by giving women</p><p>freedoms that they did not have under the previous regime.” The essay then shifts to an analysis of the post-revolutionary stage and states, “However after the communist regimes became established and female activists very radical and threatened the male-dominated strength of the communist party, communist leaders were less willing to give in to female demands.”</p><p>This assertion is supported with material from Documents 4, 5, and 7. The essay continues by noting the irony that in regimes that had started by fighting “valiantly for feminist rights” some women end up worrying about “the basic need for food, as their countries were plagued by corruption and nearing collapse” in the 1980s. Overall, the essay demonstrates an ability</p><p>to develop a nuanced historical argument accounting for contradictions between stated goals and political realities, complex factors motivating policy, and changing historical trends.</p><p>Example of unacceptable argument development:</p><p>A response that attempts to develop an argument that communist movements had an ambivalent impact on the struggle for women’s rights but fails because the disparate and contradictory evidence from the documents is addressed using categories of analysis that are either simplistic or do not fit the documents, e.g., an essay that misconstrues the documents as belonging to two groups “those who agree with the communist movements” and “people who disagree with the communist movements.”</p>","o":[{"l":"0 points","v":0,"m":2,"d":"<p>The student response earns none of the following points:</p><p></p><p><strong>1 point </strong>Presents a thesis that makes a historically defensible claim and responds to all parts of the question.

These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.</p><p>Example of acceptable synthesis by connecting the argument to different course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question:</p><p>A possible example might be an essay that connects the communist rhetoric of gender equality in the workplace, and in society in general, to an analysis of Soviet-style economic development, with its emphasis on forced industrialization, full employment, and centrally planned economic parameters. Such a response might point out that having a workforce that incorporates all members of society of working age was essential for meeting the economic objective of the Soviet state. Alternatively, an analysis of Soviet economic priorities, with their unwavering emphasis on heavy industry and landmark macroeconomic projects, may have pointed out that producing consumer goods in many communist countries was seen as a relatively low priority, resulting in chronic shortages and deficits of food items and other basic needs. These shortages placed an especially heavy burden on women and, ultimately, discredited the regimes’ emancipatory rhetoric by the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>Example that did not appropriately connect the argument to course themes and/or approaches to history that are not the main focus of the question:</p><p>The response attempts to incorporate economic analysis, but it does not go far enough to earn the point: “Communism, as they say, is a great idea until you run out of people’s money. So, with the focus of planned economy and not allowing for free markets, the women of Romania should not have been surprised they couldn’t find food to buy.”</p><p>c) Responses can extend their argument by using insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to explain the effects of communism on women’s rights (Synthesis proficiency C6). These connections must consist of more than just a phrase or reference.</p><p>Examples of acceptable synthesis by using insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to extend the argument:</p><p>A response might use insights from the discipline of comparative government and politics to extend the argument or qualify its interpretation of the documents: “While these documents [Document 3 and Document 5] paint a rosy picture of women’s life under communist rule, we know that women (like all communist citizens) did not have the right to express themselves freely, as there was censorship and a lack of free press. Likewise, we know from the political systems of communism that they all pretended to have a democratic system, while in reality the one single communist party was controlling everything. Elections happened, but they didn’t decide much, as only the candidates approved by the party could win. One could be sent to prison or worse if one protested his or her conditions too openly. Thus we should question how much it means to have laws or constitutions give equality to women, if the state and the party could change any policy they wanted.”</p><p>Example of an essay that did not appropriately use insights from a different discipline or field of inquiry to extend the argument:</p><p>This response refers to knowledge from a different discipline (demography) that is broadly relevant to changes in gender and family dynamics in the 20th century, but it fails to connect these insights clearly and specifically to the topic of communism’s effect on women’s rights: “Like many countries going through industrialization, communist countries go from women having lots of children but few of them surviving in the early period to women having only one or two children who have a great chance of surviving to be adults. Eventually, the birth rates shrinks even further and population declines.”</p>","af":"<p></p>"}]},"FT571652_rubric_category_0":{"id":"FT571652_rubric_category_0","t":"custom","ti":"Part A, B, C","s":"<p>Question-Specific Scoring Guide</p><p>• ONE point for identifying one way in which the author challenges commonly</p><p>held assumptions about the Americas in the age of European colonialism</p><p>• ONE point for explaining one example of a society other than the Comanche</p><p>that made the type of transition described by the author in the first paragraph</p><p>• ONE point for explaining one example of a nomadic empire other than the</p><p>Comanche that successfully confronted an established state or states in</p><p>world history</p><p></p><p>Scoring Notes</p><p>Examples of responses to part (a) that would earn credit:</p><p>• By analyzing how the Comanche expanded their power across the American</p><p>Southwest, the author challenges the notion that Native Americans adhered</p><p>strictly to their traditional ways of life without adapting to the changing</p><p>circumstances introduced by European powers in the Americas.</p><p>• The author challenges the idea that the Europeans were the only empire</p><p>builders in the Americas by illustrating how the Comanche extended their</p><p>power and influence into Spanish territory.</p><p>• The author challenges the assumption that European power was unstoppable.</p><p>The Comanche provided more than effective resistance as mounted fighters</p><p>and threatened Euro-American holdings.</p><p></p><p>Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit:</p><p>• The nomadic Arabs converted to Islam in the seventh century c.e., and</p><p>conquered much of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) and Persian empires.

and Che Guevara sought to overthrow United States-dominated</p><p>governments in Latin America.</p><p>• Both images reflect increasing challenges to the Western-dominated global</p><p>political order,

Western</p><p>economic domination and advocated for more equitable distribution</p><p>of wealth.</p><p></p><p>Examples of responses to part (b) that would earn credit:</p><p>• While both Mohandas Gandhi and Che Guevara wanted to end foreign</p><p>influence in their respective states, Gandhi sought to retain popular support</p><p>among India’s social classes and religious groups by advocating a traditional</p><p>view of society in which women were subservient to men, whereas Guevara</p><p>and other communist guerilla movements sought popular support by</p><p>advocating economic and gender equality.</p><p>• Gandhi employed economic pressure and nonviolence to influence change in</p><p>British India, while Guevara used and promoted violent guerilla warfare as</p><p>the best means to overthrow United States–backed regimes in Latin America.</p><p>• Gandhi emphasized Indian nationalism and acquired broad support among</p><p>India’s social classes, while Guevara based his rhetoric on Marxism and</p><p>appealed to the lower classes in Latin America.</p><p></p><p>Examples of responses to part (c) that would earn credit:</p><p>• Art allows political leaders to reach largely illiterate populations and thereby</p><p>widen their base of support.</p><p>• The depiction of revolutionary leaders as self-sacrificing participants in</p><p>the struggle against foreign domination were meant to inspire a sense of</p><p>nationalism and loyalty to the leader and the cause.</p><p>• The image of Che Guevara in a military uniform with eyes focused ahead</p><p>serves as a call to
