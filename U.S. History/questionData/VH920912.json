Jackson’s paternalism was predicated on his assumption, then widely but not universally shared by white Americans, that all Indians . . . were [irrational] and inferior to all whites. His promises about voluntary and compensated relocation . . . were constantly undermined by delays and by sharp dealing by War Department negotiators—actions Jackson condoned. . . . Jackson tried to head off outright fraud, but the removal bill’s allotment scheme invited an influx of outside speculators, who wound up buying between 80 and 90 percent of the land owned by Indians who wished to stay at a fraction of its actual worth. At no point did Jackson consider allowing even a small number of Georgia Cherokees who preferred to stay to do so in select enclaves, an option permitted to small numbers of Iroquois in upstate New York and Cherokees in western North Carolina. . . . Bereft of long-term planning and a full-scale federal commitment, the realities of Indian removal belied Jackson’s rhetoric. Although the worst suffering was inflicted after he left office, Jackson cannot escape responsibility for setting in motion an insidious policy that uprooted tens of thousands of Choctaws and Creeks [from the Southeast] during his presidency.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Sean Wilentz, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln</span>, published in 2005</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some representatives of Jackson profited by purchasing land from American Indians who were forcibly relocated.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some of Jackson’s agents encouraged American Indians from Ohio and Florida to leave their homelands as well.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Jackson had led United States armies that conquered American Indian peoples in the Southeast and forced land cessions.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Jackson believed that relocating American Indians was the only action that would enable them to preserve their way of life.</p>"],"answer":2}]
