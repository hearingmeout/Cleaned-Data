But in fact when Bill Clinton . . . signed the welfare reform law in August 1996 he signaled surrender: the Reagan Revolution was going to achieve its major goals. . . .</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“. . . [When] the new Congress arrived in January 1995, they set the agenda not just with moves to balance the budget but with an effort to ‘end welfare as we know it,’ [President Bill] Clinton’s campaign promise.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“. . . The Republican proposal meant abolishing the federal guarantee of entitlement and turning AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] over to the states. . . . The idea of turning AFDC to the states had been prominently featured in Ronald Reagan’s ‘New Federalism’ proposal advanced in his State of the Union speech in 1982. . . .</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“. . . Clinton agreed to sign a modified bill in August [1996]. . . . The bill preserved the federal guarantees of food stamps and Medicaid. . . . However, of much greater significance was the transformation of Clinton’s original proposal to reform welfare by spending more money on child care and job training into a program that guaranteed cuts amounting to $55 billion over six years. Instead of reforming welfare, he had abolished it, turning it over to the states with inadequate funds to maintain services.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Michael Allen Meeropol, historian, study of the presidential administration of Bill Clinton, published in 1998</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
