We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if the White American businessmen will not give full employment, then the means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in the community so that the people of the community can organize and employ all of its people and give a high standard of living. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">6. We want all Black men to be exempt from military service. We believe that Black people should not be forced to fight in the military service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like Black people, are being victimized. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">8. We want freedom for all Black men held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails. We believe that all Black people should be released from the many jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Black Panther Party, Ten-Point Program, 1966</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Optimism among White people in the United States that racial discrimination was being eliminated</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Growing support among young activists in the Civil Rights movement for nonviolent protest</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Frustrations among Civil Rights activists that social and political change was not occurring fast enough</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Tensions within the federal government over the best way to combat communist influence in Civil Rights movements</p>"],"answer":2}]
