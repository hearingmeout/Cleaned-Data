We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes . . . is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">United States Supreme Court, ruling in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Loving</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Virginia</span>, 1967</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">reflected feminist demands for changes within the Civil Rights movement</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">represented responses by the federal government to calls for the expansion of civil rights</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">represented debates among civil rights activists over the best strategies to pursue</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">reflected the adoption of violent protest tactics among civil rights activists in the 1960s</p>"],"answer":1}]
