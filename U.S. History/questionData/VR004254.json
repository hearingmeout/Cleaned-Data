The method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong. We cannot finance the country, we cannot improve social conditions, through any system of injustice, even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. Those who suffer the most harm will be the poor. . . . The wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which everyone will have a better chance to be successful.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">President Calvin Coolidge, inaugural address, 1925</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Anti-imperialists in the 1890s</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">New Dealers in the 1930s</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Great Society supporters in the 1960s</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">New conservatives in the 1980s</p>"],"answer":3}]
