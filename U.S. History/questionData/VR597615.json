Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">yours</span>, not <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">mine</span>. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">You </span>may rejoice, <i class=\"stressed_text_2\">I</i> must mourn.
