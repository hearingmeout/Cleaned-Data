Like any other states in the Union, these were expected to provide for their own security. Anxious to gain political legitimacy in the eyes of a white population who largely regarded them as ‘regimes,’ these state governments had strong reasons to downplay the subversive activities within their borders. Instead, . . . they respected the civil liberties of ex-Confederates and, with only a few exceptions, permitted their bitterest foes full participation [in] the political process. They treated the Ku Klux Klan’s extensive campaigns of murder, assault, and intimidation as mere criminal activity. Those accused of such acts therefore enjoyed full access to the courts—and often dominated them.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Mark Grimsley, historian, “Wars for the American South: The First and Second Reconstructions Considered as Insurgencies,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Civil War History</span>, 2012</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Reconstruction created only temporary political opportunities for formerly enslaved people.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Union army generally took extensive measures to reorder race relations in the South.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">African Americans were generally opposed to Southern Republican state governments.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Northern resolve to engage in Reconstruction began to wane only in the mid-1870s.</p>"],"answer":0}]
