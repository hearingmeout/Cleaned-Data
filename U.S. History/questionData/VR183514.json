It is, however, understood, that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation. . . . An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise . . . might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean, have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse . . . agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles, and return with the information acquired. . . . While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery . . . our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well as to its own interests, to explore this, the only line of easy communication across the continent, and so directly traversing our own part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress. . . . The appropriation of two thousand five hundred dollars, ‘for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States,’ . . . would cover the undertaking from notice.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">President Thomas Jefferson, secret message to Congress, January 1803</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">tariff in the national economy</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">extent of federal government authority</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">continuation of slavery</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">French Revolution</p>"],"answer":1}]
