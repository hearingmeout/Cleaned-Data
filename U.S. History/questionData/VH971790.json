The first was the suppression of Indian norms of family life, community organization, and religion. . . . Reformers tried to educate Indian children in order to instill mainstream American Protestant values in place of tribal values. Finally, reformers sought a policy of land allotment that would break up communal landholding patterns and create private ownership. In the end, Indians would be Christian farmers living in nuclear families on their own land. The remaining lands could then be opened to white farmers. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“The strength of Indian communities during this period declined while the power of the federal bureaucracy that supervised them increased.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Richard White, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">“It’s Your Misfortune and None of My Own”: A New History of the American West</span>, published in 1991</p></div></div><div class=\"passage\"><div class=\"prose style:1\"><p class=\"passage_para\">“As reformers and federal officials alike recognized, the key to ‘assimilation’ was ‘detribalization,’ and the key to ‘detribalization’ was eradication of the land base and communal practices that sustained tribal culture. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Congress enacted the General Allotment Act (also known as the Dawes Severalty Act) in 1887. . . .

Indians regularly traversed reservation boundaries, often in defiance of government regulations and [travel] pass requirements, to visit one another and to exchange labor and goods, extending lines of communication and interethnic relations . . . . In doing so, they deepened their own tribal attachments while developing a sense of pan-tribal Indianness.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Steven Hahn, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">A Nation Without Borders: The United States and Its World in an Age of Civil Wars, 1830–1910</span>, published in 2016</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The federal government sought to grant members of American Indian tribes United States citizenship.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States Congress saw treaties as the best way to promote American Indian economic development.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Federal officials desired to encourage the adoption of White American lifestyles by American Indians.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The United States wanted to force American Indians to provide labor for agriculture and mining.</p>"],"answer":2}]
