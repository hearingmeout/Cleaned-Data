They realized that they had run out of options. Between 1914 and 1917, Americans had variously hoped that their nation could serve as an arbiter (as it had during the Russo-Japanese War, earning Theodore Roosevelt the country’s first Nobel Peace Prize), the leader of a global peace movement, the center of international arbitration, and the advocate of worldwide disarmament. By early 1917, however, the majority had come to two conclusions. First, as Charles Fremont Taylor, the editor of a Philadelphia-based magazine, articulated, ‘no nation can be a hermit in these days of steamships, railroads, telegraphs, ocean cables, wireless, etc.’ They no longer believed, as they had in 1914, that the Atlantic Ocean provided the country with sufficient protection from Europe’s wars. Second, they believed that their leaders had tried every option short of war only to find the country in an even more perilous geopolitical position.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Michael S.
