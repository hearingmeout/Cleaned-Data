It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document D</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"A cartoon image titled, “Onward and Upward” shows two Lyndon B.

Kennedy, 1968</p>\n\n<p>For years we have been told that the measure of our success and progress in Vietnam was increasing security and control for the population. Now we have seen that none of the population is secure and no area is under such control . . . .</p>\n\n<p>This has not happened because our men are not brave or effective, because they are. It is because we have not conceived our mission in this war. It is because we have misconceived the nature of the war. It is because we have sought to resolve by military might a conflict whose issue depends upon the will and conviction of the South Vietnamese people. It is like sending a lion to halt an epidemic of jungle rot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document F</strong></p>\n\n<p>Source: James Fallows, writing about his 1969 draft board experience<br />\n<br />\n. . . Even as the last of the Cambridge contingent was throwing its urine and deliberately failing its color-blindness tests, buses from the next board began to arrive. These bore the boys from Chelsea, thick, dark-haired young men, the white proles [members of the working class] of Boston. Most of them were younger than us, since they had just left high school, and it had clearly never occurred to them that there might be a way around the draft. They walked through the examination lines like so many cattle off to slaughter. I tried to avoid noticing, but the results were inescapable. While perhaps four out of five of my friends from Harvard were being deferred, just the opposite was happening to the Chelsea boys.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document G</strong></p>\n\n<p>Source: Richard Nixon, Address to the Nation, 1969<br />\n<br />\nI know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days. But I feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion. . . .</p>\n\n<p><br />\nLet historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the forces of totalitarianism. And so tonight to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans, I ask for your support. . . .<br />\n<br />\nLet us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document H</strong></p>\n\n<p>Source: George McGovern, 1972<br />\n<br />\nWhat I propose is that we spend all that is necessary for prudent national defense, and no more. I propose that we conserve our limited resources:<br />\n<br />\n-By no longer underwriting the appalling waste of money and manpower that has become such a bad habit in our military establishment;<br />\n-By rejecting the purchase of weapons which are designed to fight the last war better, with almost no relevance to today’s threat;<br />\n-By refusing to maintain extra military forces that can have no other purpose than to repeat our experience in Vietnam, a venture which nearly all of us now recognize as a monstrous national blunder;<br />\n-By repudiating the false world of old discredited myths, made up of blocs, puppets, and dominoes, facing instead the real world of today and the future with multiple ideologies and interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document I</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nSource: The War Powers Act, 1973<br />\n<br />\nSEC. 5(b) Within sixty calendar days after a report is submitted or is required to be submitted pursuant to section 4(a)(1), whichever is earlier, the President shall terminate any use of United States Armed Forces with respect to which such report was submitted (or required to be submitted), unless the Congress (1) has declared war or has enacted a specific authorization for such use of United States Armed Forces, (2) has extended by law such sixty-day period, or (3) is physically unable to meet as a result of an armed attack upon the United States.</p>\n"}]}]
