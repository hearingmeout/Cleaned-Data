The potential for [political] victories for independent white candidates through black electoral support was not lost on Democratic leadership. In 1888, North Carolina Democrats reacted to the black and independent threat by passing election laws that gave greater discretion to handpicked Democratic election registrars to disqualify potential voters. . . . The pattern of black disfranchisement continued in other parts of the South. In Georgia, independent political efforts challenging or seeking to reform the Democratic Party led to the establishment of ‘white primaries’ in the 1880s, further blocking black electoral participation. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“. . .
