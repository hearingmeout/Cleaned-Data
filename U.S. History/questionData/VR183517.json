It is, however, understood, that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation. . . . An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise . . . might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean, have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse . . . agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles, and return with the information acquired. . . . While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery . . . our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well as to its own interests, to explore this, the only line of easy communication across the continent, and so directly traversing our own part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress. . . . The appropriation of two thousand five hundred dollars, ‘for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States,’ . . . would cover the undertaking from notice.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">President Thomas Jefferson, secret message to Congress, January 1803</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">prompting American Indian resistance to United States expansion and bringing about new federal government efforts focused on control</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">creating an interior empire in North America in which interaction with the United States government was primarily peaceful and mutually beneficial</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">providing the foundation for a new forced-labor system in which American Indians had to submit to the control of large landholders</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">plowing under much of the Great Plains for the expansion of farming and reducing the buffalo herds on which many American Indians in the West relied</p>"],"answer":0}]
