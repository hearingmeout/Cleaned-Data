After a long day laboring in a factory or shop, young women dressed themselves in their fanciest finery, put on their dancing shoes, and hurried out to the neighborhood hall, ballroom, or saloon equipped with a dance floor. . . . By the 1910s, over five hundred public dance halls opened their doors each evening throughout greater New York. . . .</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“New ballrooms and dance palaces offered a novel kind of social space for their female patrons, enhancing and legitimizing their participation in a public social life.

These working-class, largely immigrant women comprised a subordinated group long denied an active voice in recognized political forums. By occupying the arena of labor politics through a mass strike, they demanded a voice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Nan Enstad, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Ladies of Labor, Girls of Adventure: Working Women, Popular Culture, and Labor Politics at the Turn of the Twentieth Century</span>, 1999</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
