These are objections which are not local, but apply equally to all the states.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“As the Convention was called for the ‘sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation . . . ,’ I did not conceive that these powers extend to the formation of the plan proposed; but the Convention being of a different opinion, I acquiesced [agreed] in it, being fully convinced that, to preserve the Union, an efficient government was indispensably necessary, and that it would be difficult to make proper amendments to the Articles of Confederation.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“The Constitution proposed has few, if any, federal features, but is rather a system of national government. Nevertheless, in many respects, I think it has great merit, and, by proper amendments, may be adapted. . . .</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“Others may suppose that the Constitution may be safely adopted, because therein provision is made to amend it. But cannot this object be better attained before a ratification than after it?
