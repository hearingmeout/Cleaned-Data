Respect the opportunity which is now offered to obtain comfortable homes, [as] the time may soon pass away when such advantages as are now within your reach may not again be presented. If from the course you now pursue this shall be the case, then call not upon your great Father hereafter to relieve you of your troubles, but make up your minds conclusively to remain upon the lands you occupy and be subject to the laws of the state where you now reside to the extent that her own citizens are. This you must do, and complain no more . . . it will be useless . . . In a few years, by becoming amalgamated [integrated] with the whites, your national character will be lost; and then like other tribes who have gone before, you must disappear and be forgotten.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Brothers!
