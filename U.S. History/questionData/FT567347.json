Some time ago they carried a law through the Illinois legislature, which provides for the limiting of freight rates by a board of officials appointed for this purpose. The railroads, of course, opposed this measure, and it was carried to the United States Supreme Court to test its constitutionality, resulting in a complete victory for the Patrons. Illinois is the only state in the country to have such laws.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Document D</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"A black and white photo titled “The Wheat Harvest, 1880” is shown.

Whence does it come? Let the five great trunk lines which have their termini on the borders of Lake Michigan answer. Like the outstretched fingers of a hand, they meet in the central palm, Chicago.

The citizenship question aside, the folly and injustice of reserving many millions of acres of arable land as a wilderness used only as a camping ground for a few thousand lazy, squalid governmental paupers is palpable. If the Indians must be fed and herded like a dumb brute, it should be done with smaller enclosures and not so senselessly at the expense of the American homesteader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document J</strong></p>\n\n<p>Source: Excerpts from a speech by William Jennings Bryan, July 1896</p>\n\n<p>You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the fold standard.
