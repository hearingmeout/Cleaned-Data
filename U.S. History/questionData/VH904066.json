It will produce that collision between the different authorities which should be wished for in order to check each other. To attempt to abolish the states altogether, would degrade the councils of our country, would be impracticable, would be ruinous. [John Dickinson] compared the proposed national system to the solar system, in which the states were the planets, and ought to be left to move freely in their proper orbits. . . . If the state governments were excluded from all agency in the national one, and all power drawn from the people at large, the consequence would be, that the national government would move in the same direction as the state governments now do, and would run into all the same mischiefs [troubles].”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">John Dickinson, delegate from Delaware, summary of a speech at the Constitutional Convention from the notes of James Madison, 1787</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The autonomy of colonial legislatures from Great Britain</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The absence of colonial representation in Parliament</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The enforcement of commercial regulations by British officials</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The authority of the king over his colonial governors</p>"],"answer":0}]
