When it was announced that the wages were to be cut down, great indignation was felt, and it was decided to strike, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">en masse</span> [as a whole]. This was done. The mills were shut down, and the girls went in procession from their several corporations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and listened to ‘incendiary’ [radical] speeches from early labor reformers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“One of the girls stood on a pump, and gave vent to the feelings of her companions in a neat speech, declaring that it was their duty to resist all attempts at cutting down the wages. This was the first time a woman had spoken in public in Lowell, and the event caused surprise and consternation among her audience.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Harriet Hanson Robinson, later recollections of a strike in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1836, published in <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Loom and Spindle or Life Among the Early Mill Girls</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
