Most Americans used the negro to defend their own economic interests and, refusing him adequate land and real education and even common justice, deserted him shamelessly as soon as their selfish interests were safe.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“The main question to which the Negroes returned again and again [during Reconstruction] was the problem of owning land. It was ridiculed as unreasonable and unjust to the impoverished landholders of the South, and as a part of the desire for revenge which the North had. . . . [But] again and again . . . [formerly enslaved people] expressed their right to the land and the deep importance of this right. . . .</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“What [White Southerners and some White Northerners] insisted on during Reconstruction was labor, continuous, steady labor. . . . Of labor for the economic benefit of the laborer . . . they had no conception; and to any transfer of capital in land to the laborer . . . they were bitterly opposed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">W.

To measure the significance of emancipation is not to compare the material rewards of freedom and slavery, as many contemporaries were apt to do, but to appreciate the many and varied ways in which the newly freed moved to reorder their lives and priorities and the new assumptions upon which they acted.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Leon F.
