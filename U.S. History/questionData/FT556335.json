Thus, the cornerstone of the Republic, our chief bulwark against the encroachment of individual freedom by Big Government, is fast disappearing under the piling sands of absolutism....</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The root evil is that the government is engaged in activities in which it has no legitimate business.

Young people between the ages of twenty-five and forty have been born and reared in a different world than Americans of years past. The television set has been their primary baby-sitter. From the television set they have learned situation ethics and immorality—they have learned a loss of respect for human life. They have learned to disrespect the family as God has established it. They have been educated in a public-school system that is permeated with secular humanism. They have been taught that the Bible is just another book of literature. They have been taught that there are no absolutes in our world today. They have been introduced to the drug culture. They have been reared by the family and the public school in a society that is greatly void of discipline and character-building. These same young people have been reared under the influence of a government that has taught them socialism and welfarism. They have been taught to believe that the world owes them a living whether they work or not.<br />\n<br />\n<sub>From AMERICA: A NARRATIVE HISTORY, SEVENTH EDITION by George Brown Tindall &amp; David E.

This philosophy once occupied a hallowed place in American diplomacy, but it was casually... dismissed at the outset by the Carter Administration—and the results have been shattering. Never before in modern history has the United States endured as many humiliations, insults, and defeats as it has during the past four years: our ambassadors murdered, our embassies burned, our warnings ignored, our diplomacy scorned, our diplomats kidnapped. The Carter Administration has shown that it neither understands totalitarianism nor appreciates the way tyrants take advantage of weakness. The brutal invasion of Afghanistan promises to be only the forerunner of much more serious threats to the West—and to world peace—should the Carter Administration somehow cling to power.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><strong>Document 6</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Source: Teddi Holt, a homemaker, a member of Georgia Stop ERA, and the national president of Mothers On the March, 1984.<br />\n<br />\nI am pleased that God blessed me with the privilege of being a woman.

There’s no doubt that there has been discrimination against women, but that is past history, just as discrimination against blacks is past history in the US....<br />\n<br />\nJust what were we women to be liberated from?

In no way are we extremists, unless we be guilty of extreme devotion to our husbands, our children, and our homes. It is our sincere belief that if we do not unite against the threats to the home, if we retire to the convenience and security of our houses and do not speak out, then it will not be long until we, the “keeper at home” (Titus 2.5) will not have a home to keep!<br />\n<br />\n<sub>Excerpt from “Women Who Do and Women Who Don’t Join the Women’s Movement” by Teddi Holt and edited by Robyn Rowland, Copyright © 1984 by Teddi Holt.
