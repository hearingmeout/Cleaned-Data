Language is the expression of ideas; and if the people of one country cannot preserve an identity of ideas, they cannot retain an identity of language. . . . But the principal differences between the people of this country and of all others, arise from different forms of government, different laws, institutions and customs. Thus the . . . feudal system of England originated terms which formed . . . a necessary part of the language of that country; but, in the United States, many of these terms are no part of our present language,—and they cannot be, for the things which they express do not exist in this country. . . . The institutions in this country which are new and peculiar, give rise to new terms or to new applications of old terms, unknown to the people of England; which cannot be explained by them and which will not be inserted in their dictionaries, unless copied from ours. . . . No person in this country will be satisfied with the English definitions of the words congress, senate, and assembly, court, [etc.] for although these are words used in England, yet they are applied in this country to express ideas which they do not express in that country.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Noah Webster, “Preface,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">An American Dictionary of the English Language</span>, 1828</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The innovations in the market revolution creating new wealth for Americans</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emergence of a new and distinctive American culture</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The transition of the United States to a more participatory democracy</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The importance of reading literacy among Americans</p>"],"answer":1}]
