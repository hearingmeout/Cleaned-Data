We must not, however, permit employees of the Federal Government to be labeled as disloyal or potentially disloyal to their Government when no valid basis exists for arriving at such a conclusion. The overwhelming majority of Federal employees are loyal citizens who are giving conscientiously of their energy and skills to the United States. I do not want them to fear they are the objects of any ‘witch hunt.’ . . . Rumor, gossip, or suspicion will not be sufficient to lead to the dismissal of an employee for disloyalty.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">President Harry Truman, statement on the government’s employee loyalty program, 1947</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">discouraged participation in the Civil Rights movement</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">posed a serious threat to civil liberties</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">would increase membership in the Communist Party</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">exposed the lack of federal protections for workers</p>"],"answer":1}]
