The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the government under which she lives; in the religion she is asked to believe; equality in social life, where she is a chief factor; a place in the trades and professions, where she may earn her bread, is because of her birthright to self-sovereignty; because, as an individual, she must rely on herself. No matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton, “The Solitude of Self,” speech to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, 1892</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Educational opportunities for women should be directed toward preparing them for household labor.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Federal laws should be passed to protect female workers from unsafe conditions in factories.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The inherent natural rights of women should be respected by government and society.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The leaders of the reform movement to prohibit alcohol consumption should be women.</p>"],"answer":2}]
