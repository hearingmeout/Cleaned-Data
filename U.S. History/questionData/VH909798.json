Thus the ultimate effect of the suburban escape in our time is, ironically, a low-grade uniform environment from which escape is impossible.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Lewis Mumford, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects</span>, 1961</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The rise of youth rebellion against middle class values helped expand a new consumer niche for products marketed directly to teenagers.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Many Americans developed a more cosmopolitan outlook after experiencing cultures different from their own during the Second World War.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Recent periods of economic depression and war encouraged many families to seek stability and security.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The technological innovations available in new homes, such as air-conditioning and dishwashers, fostered a sense of social isolation for many women.</p>"],"answer":2}]
