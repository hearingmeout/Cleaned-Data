The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the government under which she lives; in the religion she is asked to believe; equality in social life, where she is a chief factor; a place in the trades and professions, where she may earn her bread, is because of her birthright to self-sovereignty; because, as an individual, she must rely on herself. No matter how much women prefer to lean, to be protected and supported, nor how much men desire to have them do so, they must make the voyage of life alone.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton, “The Solitude of Self,” speech to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, 1892</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The spread of evangelical religious revivals encouraged advocacy for equality between men and women.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The gathering of the Seneca Falls Convention led to increased awareness of women’s rights.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The popularization of republican motherhood inspired women’s aspirations for greater political participation.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The expansion of educational opportunities fostered frustration about continuing social limitations for women.</p>"],"answer":3}]
