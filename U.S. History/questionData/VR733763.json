I gave up my office work which I enjoyed. . . . [I was rewarded with] a nice home I can run the way I want to. A husband to be a lifetime companion and ‘protector.’ A fine group of children. . . .</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“[But] much of our trouble has centered around my husband’s unwillingness to do work around the house, which he says is my sole responsibility. . . . With the children’s care, housework, repairs, leaf raking, snow shoveling, some lawn mowing and making all our clothing (so we could save every penny we could toward a house) I became physically and nervously exhausted. My husband refused to get up with the children or let me stay in bed even one morning.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Source: </span>Nora Grey, response to a questionnaire about her marriage for a scientific study, circa the mid-1950s</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}]
