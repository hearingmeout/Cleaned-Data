Depend upon it, this soon will be <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">the</span> question of the day. All other reforms, however important they may be, cannot so deeply affect the interests of humanity as this one. Let it [this challenge] therefore be fairly and candidly met. . . .</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“We have recently had the pleasure of listening to a sermon on this subject, and we feel truly grateful that the pulpit is, at length, calling public attention to this important question. In the course of this sermon the Bible argument was touched upon. We hope it may yet be gone into more fully: for the Bible is the great Charter of human rights when it is taken in its true spiritual meaning; though its great, immortal, life-giving truths can be perverted by narrow, bigoted, sectarian teachers so as to favor all kinds of oppression, and to degrade and crush humanity itself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"attribution author\">Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth W.
