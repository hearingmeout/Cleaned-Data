Starting in that summer [of 1964] he also established the first of what ultimately became 135 ‘task forces’ to study a wide range of social problems. . . . Much of what he requested aimed to go beyond . . . the New Deal in order to create a Great Society that would be qualitatively better and that would guarantee ‘rights’ and government entitlements.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">James T.
