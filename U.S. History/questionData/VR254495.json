The slave-trade will be abolished; the people will enter at once into the enjoyment of freedom; her ports will be open to the commerce of the world, her soil cultivated to its full capability, her products sent to an unrestricted market; and under the influence of the moral and political forces which are the vital elements of the American nationality, her children educated, and her pulpits and presses set at liberty, she would become the most prosperous of the States.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Document 4</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: Andrew J.
