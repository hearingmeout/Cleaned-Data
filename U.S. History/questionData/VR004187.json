Family life depended on the smooth performance of an extensive array of unpaid occupations in the household, and on the presence . . . of someone to provide that work—to supervise the children through the vicissitudes of a changing social and economic order; to make and mend clothes, quilts, pillows, and other household furnishings; to shop for items the household could afford . . . , and scavenge . . . for those it could not; to clean, cook, and bake; and, whenever necessary, to move from unpaid to paid labor to bolster the household income.

Nor had it reduced housework to unskilled labor.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Jeanne Boydston, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Home and Work</span>, 1990</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">obtaining positions in textile mills</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">signing contracts for indentured servitude</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">performing clerical and secretarial labor for large corporations</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">participating in secular and religious reform associations</p>"],"answer":0}]
