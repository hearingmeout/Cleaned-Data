The immediate origins of this phenomenon lay in the sharp increase of immigration after 1845.... The average quadrupled in the 1830s. But even this paled in comparison with the immigration of the late 1840s.... During the decade 1846 to 1855, more than three million immigrants entered the United States—equivalent to 15 percent of the 1845 population. This was the largest proportional increase in the foreign-born population for any ten-year period in American history....
