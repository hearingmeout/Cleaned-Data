Its cause was at once seen to be, the use of intoxicating liquor; and its appropriate remedy, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">abstinence</span>. It was also known, that the use of such liquor, as a beverage, is not only needless, but injurious to the health, the virtue, and the happiness of men. It was believed, that the facts which had been . . . collected would prove this . . . ; and that if the knowledge of them were universally disseminated it would, with the divine blessing, do much toward changing the habits of the nation. . . .
