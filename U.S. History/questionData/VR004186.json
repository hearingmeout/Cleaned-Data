Family life depended on the smooth performance of an extensive array of unpaid occupations in the household, and on the presence . . . of someone to provide that work—to supervise the children through the vicissitudes of a changing social and economic order; to make and mend clothes, quilts, pillows, and other household furnishings; to shop for items the household could afford . . . , and scavenge . . . for those it could not; to clean, cook, and bake; and, whenever necessary, to move from unpaid to paid labor to bolster the household income. The growth . . . of the cash [economy] of the Northeast had not rendered this labor superfluous. Nor had it reduced housework to unskilled labor.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Jeanne Boydston, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Home and Work</span>, 1990</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The abolitionist movement</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Increased immigration</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The market revolution</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The emergence of mass political parties</p>"],"answer":2}]
