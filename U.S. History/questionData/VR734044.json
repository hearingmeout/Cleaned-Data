The old-time idea that a lady must not earn her livelihood had to go down before stern need. . . . Many women faced the terror of family displeasure and went to work, choosing personal independence rather than the misguided approbation of relatives and friends.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">“. . .
