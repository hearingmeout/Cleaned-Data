In America, it was in the colonial cities that the transition first occurred from a barter economy to a commercial one. . . . The cities predicted the future.... Urban people, at a certain point in the preindustrial era, upset the equilibrium of an older system of social relations and turned the seaport towns into crucibles of revolutionary agitation.”</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;-Gary B. Nash, historian, The Urban Crucible, 1986</p>\n\n<p><em>“The colonist’s attitudes toward civil uprising were part of a broader Anglo-American political tradition. In the course of the eighteenth century, colonists became increasingly interested in the ideas of seventeenth-century English revolutionaries . . . and the later writers who carried on and developed this tradition. . . . By the 1760s . . . this . . . tradition provided a strong unifying element between colonists North and South. It offered, too, a corpus of ideas about public authority and popular political responsibilities that shaped the American revolutionary movement. Spokesmen for this English revolutionary tradition were distinguished in the eighteenth century above all by their outspoken defense of the people’s right to rise up against their rulers.”</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -Pauline Maier, historian, From Resistance to Revolution, 1991</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}]}]
