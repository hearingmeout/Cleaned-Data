Suppose it were even true that Great Britain had abolished all restrictions upon trade, and allowed the freest introduction of the [products] of foreign labor, would that prove it unwise for us to adopt the protecting system?

The adoption of the restrictive system, on the part of the United States, by excluding the [products] of foreign labor, would extend the [purchasing] of American [products], unable, in the infancy and unprotected state of the arts, to sustain a competition with foreign fabrics. Let our arts breathe under the shade of protection; let them be perfected as they are in England, and [then] we shall be ready . . . to put aside protection, and enter upon the freest exchanges.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Henry Clay, speaker of the House of Representatives, speech in Congress, 1824</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The political debates over economic development</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The lives of women working in new factories</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The effects of new technologies on commerce</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The value of British-manufactured imports</p>"],"answer":0}]
