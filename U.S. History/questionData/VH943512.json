It is a decision made by California herself, and which California had incontestably a right to make under the Constitution of the United States. . . . The question of slavery, either of its introduction or interdiction, is silent as respects the action of this [federal] Government; and if it has been decided, it has been by a different body—by a different power—by California herself, who had a right to make that decision.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Senator Henry Clay, speech in the United States Senate, 1850</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Congressional leaders sought political compromise to resolve discord between the North and the South.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">States in the Great Lakes region advocated to legalize slavery within their borders.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Senators appealed to the idea of American exceptionalism to encourage national unity.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The Supreme Court decision in the Dred Scott case reduced sectional conflict within the United States.</p>"],"answer":0}]
