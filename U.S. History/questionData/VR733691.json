President [George W.] Bush’s standing to lead soared, and he seized the reins. On a variety of fronts, legislators hastened to expand his authority. With just one dissenting vote in either chamber . . . Congress passed a resolution on September 14, 2001, stating that ‘the president has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States.’ . . . Overall, Bush received historically high levels of legislative support throughout his first term. As 2006 began he had yet to veto a single bill, this five-year streak the longest since Thomas Jefferson’s administration.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Andrew Rudalevige, political scientist, “The Contemporary Presidency,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Presidential Studies Quarterly</span>, 2006</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">United States peacekeeping missions in eastern Europe and Africa</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">United States launching wars in Afghanistan and Iraq</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The mediation between Israel and Egypt by the United States</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The end of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States</p>"],"answer":1}]
