Phillips, a regular contributor to the <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">American Cotton Planter</span>, wrote about soil exhaustion and crop rotation, and extolled the virtues of manuring and self-provisioning.

He used images of human, animal, and mineral depletion to represent an onrushing ecological catastrophe. But he did so within the incised [limited] terms allowed him by his culture—the culture of cotton. Phillips was arguing that the slaveholding South needed to slow the rate at which it was converting human beings into cotton plants.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Walter Johnson, historian, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom</span>, 2013</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Southern planters eventually sought to diversify the crops they grew.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some southerners relocated their plantations to the west of the Appalachian Mountains.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A cotton gin was developed that processed raw cotton more quickly.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Southerners supported protective tariffs to stimulate the United States economy.</p>"],"answer":1}]
