For terrorists, who must in the nature of their purpose be secretive, . . . we may be able to discover them before they act only if we resort to invasive and substantial surveillance, infiltration, screening, and so forth, all of which might be misused against innocents far more often than they are well used against potential terrorists.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Russell Hardin, political scientist, “Civil Liberties in the Era of Mass Terrorism,” <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Journal of Ethics</span>, 2004</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some Americans sought to use new technologies to combat terrorism.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some Americans believed that terrorism had no effect on United States domestic policy.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some Americans saw Cold War policies as providing insight into how to prevent current terrorist actions.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Some Americans worried that the freedoms of United States citizens might be violated by the efforts to stop terrorism.</p>"],"answer":3}]
