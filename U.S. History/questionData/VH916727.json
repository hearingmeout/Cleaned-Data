It is my duty . . . to place before you certain facts about the present position in Europe.</p><p class=\"passage_para\">“From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest, and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in many cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow. Athens alone—Greece with its immortal glories —is free to decide its future at an election under British, American, and French observation. . . . The Communist parties, which were very small in all these Eastern States of Europe, have been raised to preeminence and power far beyond their numbers and are seeking everywhere to obtain totalitarian control.”</p><p class=\"attribution author\">Former British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, speaking at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, “Sinews of Peace,” (better known as the “Iron Curtain Speech”), 1946</p></div></div></div>"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">highlighted a view of communism as an authoritarian threat</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">celebrated the Allies’ victory over the Axis powers in the Second World War</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">suggested concerns about communist subversion in the United States</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">encouraged direct military confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union</p>"],"answer":0}]
