In states where the slave system prevails, the masters, directly or indirectly, secure all political power, and constitute a ruling aristocracy. In states where the free-labor system prevails, universal suffrage necessarily obtains, and the state inevitably becomes, sooner or later, a republic or democracy.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"stimulus_block\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Document 6</span></p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1b\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Source: “Our national bird,” cartoon published in 1861.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a political cartoon titled “Our National Bird.” On the left side of the cartoon, a healthy bald eagle is shown with its head held high.
