The War Production Board set prices for industry, and the Office of War Information produced propaganda to rally support for the war effort. (This propaganda was crucial, because, as proven by the immense backlash to the Vietnam War in the 1960s, wars must be fought with the support of the public and with clearly defined and communicated goals in order for them to succeed.) Just as in World War I, taxes were raised and “Liberty Bonds” were sold to the public to generate additional revenue for fighting the war. However, unlike World War I, a rationing system was imposed to curb consumption of much-needed goods (in World War I, rationing had been done on a voluntary basis). President Roosevelt imposed a selective service system (a draft), which added to the size of the military. Newspapers such as the <em>Washington Post </em>tried to advocate for cheerful compliance with the draft as the ‘fairest method by which an army of the size we need can be recruited’ (1).
