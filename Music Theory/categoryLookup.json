The texture of a musical passage is based on the manner in which its layers are produced and distributed, and how they interact to form the totality of sound.","368762":"DES-1.A: Identify texture types in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368763":"DES-1.A.1: Texture refers to how musical components combine simultaneously to form an overall sound. Texture is influenced by how music is produced (e.g., the distinctive qualities of sound, or timbres), the density and spacing of pitches, and the pitch range encompassed.","368764":"DES-1.A.2: Texture types are determined by the number of musical lines present, the melodic character of these lines, and the ways in which the lines are combined simultaneously. The main types of musical texture are monophony, homophony (including chordal homophony and melody with accompaniment), polyphony (nonimitative and imitative), and heterophony. These terms appear as nouns (e.g., homophony) and as adjectives (e.g., homophonic). Other terms used to describe texture include technical terms (e.g., canon/canonic) and casual terms (e.g., call and response). Counterpoint (adjective-contrapuntal) is a term that relates closely to polyphony. Counterpoint refers specifically to the practice of composing polyphonic music, often using historical conventions, and the texture that results.","368765":"DES-1.B: Identify texture devices in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368766":"DES-1.B.1: In addition to texture type (e.g., monophony), a description of texture may include the composer's use of various texture devices. Examples include devices associated with the bass line, such as Alberti bass and walking bass, and devices associated with polyphony, such as canon, imitation, and countermelody. Other terms further describe the unique texture of a musical passage, such as solo/soli, accompaniment, doubling, ostinato, and tutti.","368767":"DES-1.C: Describe relationships among musical lines, including the number of lines present in a passage and the position of a line in relation to other lines in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368768":"DES-1.C.1: Musical lines, whether in instrumental or vocal pieces, may be described using the terms soprano, alto, tenor, and bass (collectively known as SATB), depending on their pitch position in relation to other lines. Figured bass and chorale harmonization exercises are typically notated in SATB four-voice texture.","368769":"DES-2: Timbre-As we perceive distinctive qualities of imagery, taste, smell, and touch, we can perceive distinctive qualities of musical sound, known as timbre. Timbre is based on the specific instruments and/or voices used for performance and the physical manner in which they produce sound.","368770":"DES-2.A: Identify performance media and vocal and instrumental timbres in performed music.","368771":"DES-2.A.1: Some common examples of standard performance media (or instrumentation) are-string orchestra, string quartet, SATB choir, brass quintet, jazz trio, and solo piano. Unique ensembles may be established using a distinctive mix of voices and instruments. An individual voice or instrument may be identified by its distinctive timbre, which refers to the unique quality of sound based on how the sound is produced. The sound quality is also affected by register (i.e., which part of the voice or instrument's total range is used). The most comfortable register of a given voice or instrument, known as its tessitura, is most frequently used, but sometimes voices and instruments use extreme parts of their ranges to create special effects.","368772":"DES-2.A.2: Common instrumental families in the tradition known as Western music include strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and keyboards. Each of these families has many standard members, and each member is distinguished by its timbre and register (how high or low its pitches sound). The string family includes violin, viola, cello, bass, harp, and guitar. The brass family includes trumpet, French horn, trombone, euphonium, and tuba. The woodwind family includes flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone (which comes in several different sizes, covering different registers), and bassoon. The percussion family has many members, such as drums, cymbals, marimba, and others. The keyboard family includes piano, harpsichord, and organ. In addition to these standard families, there are alternate groupings of instruments such as winds, used to describe a combined assemblage of woodwind and brass instruments. A rhythm section consists of a harmony instrument (such as piano or guitar), a bass instrument (typically double bass), and usually a drum set that form the core instrumentation of a jazz ensemble. In the Baroque period, the basso continuo included a harmony instrument (often a harpsichord) and bass instrument (such as cello) to provide the core sound of the group.","368773":"DES-3: Expressive elements-The variety of expressive elements extending beyond pitch, rhythm, form, texture, and timbre affects how music sounds, offering opportunities for individual interpretation. Expressive elements include dynamics, articulation, and tempo.","368774":"DES-3.A: Identify and apply tempo markings, including those that indicate adjustments to the prevailing tempo, used in- a. performed music b. notated music","368775":"DES-3.A.1: Tempo describes the relative speed of music's beat pulse. Tempo may be expressed by words that indicate this relative speed, ranging from very slow speeds, such as largo, larghetto, and grave; to slow speeds, such as lento and adagio; moderately slow speeds, such as andante and andantino; moderate speeds, such as moderato; and faster speeds, such as allegretto, allegro, vivace, presto, and prestissimo. Composers in different musical traditions have used words from different languages to indicate tempos, and performers are responsible for learning the meaning of tempo markings that appear in notated music. Tempo can also be indicated by a \"metronome marking,\" which identifies a note value, such as a quarter note, as a beat-note, and then labels the number of beats per minute, such as \"quarter note = 88\". Tempo markings are typically placed at the start of a movement or section of a piece.","368776":"DES-3.A.2: Directions to adjust the musical tempo may be used, including some to increase the speed (accelerando) and some to slow it down, either gradually (ritardando) or abruptly (ritenuto). Additionally, terms may be applied that suggest general freedom with respect to tempo (rubato).","368777":"DES-3.B: Identify dynamics and changes in dynamics in- a. performed music b. notated music","368778":"DES-3.B.1: Dynamics describe, in relative terms, how loud or soft music is. Dynamics are typically marked in music using abbreviations for the Italian words ranging from very soft to very loud-pp stands for pianissimo, p stands for piano, mp stands for mezzo piano, mf stands for mezzo forte, f stands for forte, and ff stands for fortissimo. Changes in dynamics may be shown with graphic symbols (sometimes called hairpins), with Italian words that call for gradual or sudden changes (crescendo, decrescendo, subito), or with abbreviations for the Italian words. A dynamic accent gives a momentary increase of volume to a specific note or notes. Dynamic accents can be indicated with sf or sfz, which stand for sforzando. Terraced dynamics indicate the sudden contrast of a loud passage of music followed by a soft passage of music, or a soft passage followed by a loud passage.","368779":"DES-3.C: Identify articulation and changes in articulation in- a. performed music b. notated music","368780":"DES-3.C.1: Articulation is an aspect of performance that describes the way a sound starts (its \"attack\") and ends, and how detached or connected adjacent pitches are. Articulations may be shown with symbols-such as staccato dots, legato (or tenuto) lines, slurs, or marcato accents-or indicated with words, such as sempre tenuto. Different types of accents have different markings. Interpretation of articulations may vary according to musical style or type of instrument, and from performer to performer. Related to articulation is the tremolo, which is the rapid and continuous repetition of a single pitch.","368781":"DES-3.D: Sight-sing a notated melody, applying all indicated markings for- a. dynamics b. articulation c. tempo","368782":"DES-3.D.1: Singing a melody at sight, without extended rehearsal or prior familiarity with it, requires observation and performance not only of the pitch and rhythm but also of the indicated expressive elements of dynamics, articulation, and tempo. In performing a melody with a single tempo marking, the performer should maintain steady tempo throughout. It is important to perform with continuity throughout-avoiding hesitations and restarts-to maintain the momentum of musical motion and properly observe the metric framework of the melody. No alterations in the tempo should be made unless the notation specifically indicates a change in tempo.","368783":"FOR: Form","368784":"FOR-1: Form-As with language, music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in which a musical composition is organized in a hierarchy of constituent parts. The specific ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed produces the unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and functions may be identified when parts of a composition follow established melodic-harmonic patterns or fulfill established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.","368785":"FOR-1.A: Identify the beginnings, ends, and lengths of phrases in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368786":"FOR-1.A.1: Music is made up of syntactical units called phrases, which may generally be described as complete musical utterances that conclude with a cadence. By delineating phrases, cadences form punctuation points that regulate the overall sense of musical flow in a composition. Four-measure and eight-measure phrases are normative, but other lengths are possible.","368787":"FOR-1.A.2: A bass line should imply an appropriate cadence at each phrase ending. Appropriate cadences include perfect authentic, imperfect authentic, half, Phrygian half, plagal, and deceptive cadences. The final cadence must be a perfect authentic cadence. This group of acceptable cadence types fit generally into two categories-inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect authentic, and deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences (i.e., perfect authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic cadence is created by the V-I progression with both harmonies in root position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An imperfect authentic cadence is also a V-I progression, but chords may be inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano","368788":"FOR-1.B: Identify the basic units of phrases (i.e., motives) and melodic/rhythmic procedures involving these units in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368789":"FOR-1.B.1: Phrases are made up of short melodic and/or rhythmic ideas called motives.

Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.","368798":"PIT-1.A: Identify pitches on the staff, using treble, bass, and C clefs, in - a. performed music b. notated music","368799":"PIT-1.A.1: Music consists of discrete tones with specific frequencies called pitches. In music notation, the specific pitch of a note is shown by the note's position on the lines and spaces of a staff, which are assigned specific letter names by a clef (treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs). The distance spanned from a given pitch up or down to the next pitch of the same letter name is called an octave. Pitch may be further distinguished by accidentals (e.g., sharps, flats, and naturals). When a pitch requires use of an accidental, the accidental should be drawn to the left of the notehead.","368800":"PIT-1.A.2: Enharmonic equivalents are tones of the same pitch spelled differently according to their musical contexts (e.g., C♯ and D♭).","368801":"PIT-1.B: Identify pitch discrepancies between notated and performed music in one or two voices.","368802":"PIT-1.B.1: A musical score outlines specifically the pitches to be performed.

Melodic passages may employ these scales.","368815":"PIT-1.H: Identify and notate a relative key and its key signature.","368816":"PIT-1.H.1: Musical passages or compositions can shift from one key to another. The key to which a passage shifts can form various key relationships with the original key, including a relative key which shares the same key signature as the original but starts on a different tonic. For example, D major and B minor both have two sharps in their key signature, but their tonics are D and B, respectively.","368817":"PIT-1.I: Identify minor and relative keys in- a. performed music b. notated music","368818":"PIT-1.I.1: A minor key has the same key signature as the major of which it is a relative.","368819":"PIT-1.I.2: The term \"mode\" is used in reference to major and minor keys. For example, a major key and a minor key are described as being in the \"major mode\" and in the \"minor mode,\" respectively. A shift from G major to G minor, for instance, would constitute a \"change in mode.\"","368820":"PIT-1.J: Describe key relationships in- a. performed music b. notated music","368821":"PIT-1.J.1: A parallel key is a key that shares the same tonic as the original but has a different key signature. For example, D major has two sharps in its key signature and is parallel to D minor, which has one flat in its key signature.","368822":"PIT-1.J.2: Closely related keys are keys whose key signatures differ from the original by no more than one accidental; these are the most common keys to which a musical passage might shift. For example, in relation to an opening tonic of D major (i.e., two sharps in the key signature), the closely related keys would consist of the relative key (B minor), the major and minor keys bearing one additional sharp (A major and F♯ minor), and the major and minor keys bearing one less sharp (G major and E minor). The following is an alternative explanation-The keys closely related to a given key are those whose tonic triads are the diatonic major and minor triads of the original key. For the key of D major, the closely related keys would be the supertonic key (E minor), the mediant key (F♯ minor), the subdominant key (G major), the dominant key (A major), and the submediant key (B minor). Relative keys are a subset of closely related keys.","368823":"PIT-1.J.3: Distantly related keys-keys whose key signatures differ from the original by more than one accidental. Parallel keys are a subset of distantly related keys.","368824":"PIT-1.K: Identify chromatic, whole-tone, and pentatonic scales in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368825":"PIT-1.K.1: Additional scales identified in music theory include chromatic, whole-tone, and pentatonic scales. Melodic passages may employ these scales. Chromatic scales have twelve pitches, each a half-step apart. Whole-tone scales have six notes, each a whole step apart. Pentatonic scales (major and minor) have five pitches from the seven pitches of a major or minor scale. Major pentatonic scales contain scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the major scale. Minor pentatonic scales contain scale degrees 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the natural minor scale.","368826":"PIT-1.L: Describe the size and quality of an interval in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368827":"PIT-1.L.1: The distance in pitch between two notes is called an interval, designated by distance between pitches (e.g., second or fifth) and quality (major, minor, perfect, diminished, or augmented). Two examples are a major second or a diminished seventh. Some intervals are alternatively designated by unique names-for example, the unison (prime) and the tritone. Intervals that sound identical but encompass different pitch spellings are enharmonic equivalents (e.g., the augmented fourth, D up to G♯, and the diminished fifth, D up to A♭).","368828":"PIT-1.L.2: Harmonic intervals describe the distance between simultaneous pitches; melodic intervals describe the distance between successive pitches. Melodic intervals are generally categorized into two generic types-a step traverses adjacent pitches of neighboring letter names (e.g., C up to D), while a leap traverses an interval larger than a step (e.g., C up to E).","368829":"PIT-1.L.3: Consonance (adjective consonant) refers to intervals that are inherently stable, meaning they have no natural inclination to move, or resolve, to other sounds. In contrast, dissonance (adjective dissonant) refers to intervals that are inherently unstable, meaning they have a natural inclination to move to other, more stable, sounds (e.g., a harmonic diminished fifth resolving inward to a third).","368830":"PIT-1.M: Identify interval inversions and compound intervals in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368831":"PIT-1.M.1: An interval's inversion may be determined by transferring the lower note up an octave. An interval plus its inversion equals a perfect octave. Put another way, when an octave is divided into two smaller intervals, the resulting two intervals are interval inversions of each other. Sizes and qualities of intervals and their inversions relate consistently as follows- * perfect intervals remain perfect when inverted. * major intervals become minor when inverted, and vice versa. * diminished intervals become augmented when inverted, and vice versa. * the sum of respective sizes of the original and inverted intervals always equals nine (e.g., a second inverts to become a seventh, or two plus seven equals nine).","368832":"PIT-1.M.2: Intervals whose sizes are smaller than or equal to an octave may be called simple intervals. When an octave is added to a simple interval, the result is a corresponding larger interval called a compound interval. For example, an octave added to a major third yields a major tenth. Because a simple interval and its corresponding compound interval contain like pitches-sounding in different octaves-the two intervals sound similar.","368833":"PIT-1.N: Identify sounding pitches that correspond to the notated pitches of a transposing instrument when given the specific level and direction of transposition.","368834":"PIT-1.N.1: Transposing instruments are those whose notated pitches are different from actual pitches that sound when played. Because many standard instruments in the tradition known as Western music belong to this category, musical scores often contain one or more instrumental parts that require the conversion of notated pitches into sounding pitches before analysis may proceed.","368835":"PIT-1.O: Describe the quality of a chord in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368836":"PIT-1.O.1: A chord consists of three or more pitches sounding simultaneously; the term also applies to collections of successive pitches that form a perceived grouping, often through arpeggiation (i.e., the use of arpeggios). In the tradition known as Western music, the two basic kinds of chord are- * triads-chords whose essence consists of three distinct pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds). * seventh chords-chords whose essence consists of four distinct pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds).","368837":"PIT-1.O.2: When the pitches of a chord are arranged in their essential configuration of stacked thirds, each pitch, or chord member, is given a specific name-the bottom note on which the chord is built is called the root, and the notes stacked above the root are called the third, the fifth, and in the case of seventh chords, the seventh.","368838":"PIT-1.O.3: The structure of intervals of a given triad or seventh chord accounts for the chord's unique sound and allows it to be classified as a specific chord quality (or type). In the tradition known as Western music, the following qualities of triad are commonly found- * major (M). * minor (m). * diminished (o or d). * augmented (+ or A).","368839":"PIT-1.P: Identify modes in- a. performed music. b. otated music.","368840":"PIT-1.P.1: Scales identified in music theory include these categories known as modes-Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. Melodic passages may employ these scales.","368841":"PIT-2: Harmony-Groupings of pitches that are successively and/or simultaneously produced form perceivable units known as chords. Chords relate to each other within an established musical style through the context of harmony.","368842":"PIT-2.A: Identify chords using letters and Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368843":"PIT-2.A.1: Triads and seventh chords built on the scale degrees of a given key constitute the diatonic chords of that key. These chords are identified using a system of symbols in which Roman numerals indicate the scale degree on which the given chord is built and the quality of the given chord. Uppercase and lowercase Roman numerals are used to indicate major and minor triads, respectively, and additional symbols are added to denote other chord qualities (e.g., lowercase Roman numerals with \"o\" indicating diminished triads and uppercase Roman numerals with \"+\" indicating augmented triads). The diatonic chords of a key can also be identified using the scale degree names of each chord's respective root (e.g., tonic, supertonic, mediant, etc.). For example, the triad built on scale degree two may be called the \"supertonic triad,\" the triad built on scale degree four may be called the \"subdominant triad,\" and the seventh chord built on scale degree five may be called the \"dominant seventh chord.\"","368844":"PIT-2.A.2: The pitches of a chord may be arranged in various ways, with special attention paid to the chord member that appears in the bass (i.e., lowest part of the chord). When the chordal root appears in the bass, the chord is said to be in root position. When chord members other than the root appear in the bass, chord inversions result. First inversion and second inversion occur when the chordal third and fifth, respectively, appear in the bass. Specific chord inversions are labeled using a system of Arabic numerals that denote intervals to be rendered above given bass notes, a convention based on an 18th-century system of musical shorthand known as figured bass. With pitch content clearly defined, these Arabic numerals may be used to imply specific chords and their inversions. An alternate system for labeling chords identifies a triad's root by capital letter-name (e.g., C) and its quality by abbreviation (e.g., \"m\" for minor); a C minor triad may be labeled \"Cm.\" Chord labels such as these are used prominently in lead sheets, where they appear above the notated melody and indicate specific chord progressions.","368845":"PIT-2.B: Use Roman numerals to indicate the harmonic progression implied by a figured bass.","368846":"PIT-2.B.1: The Arabic numerals, or figures, that appear in a figured bass denote pitches at specific intervals above each given bass note. (Octave equivalents of those pitches are also acceptable.) Since the resultant pitches are to be used in writing each corresponding chord, these Arabic numerals imply harmonies to which Roman numerals may be applied.","368847":"PIT-2.B.2: In figured bass notation, a figure with a slash or plus sign indicates the pitch denoted by that figure is to be raised a half step. An accidental appearing alone (i.e., without an Arabic numeral) indicates that the pitch lying a third above the bass should be inflected as shown (e.g., \"♯\" appearing under a given bass pitch of A denotes the pitch C♯).","368848":"PIT-2.C: Describe the quality of a seventh chord in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368849":"PIT-2.C.1: The following qualities of seventh chords are commonly found- * major seventh (MM; M7), or \"major-major\". * major-minor seventh (Mm7), or \"dominant seventh,\" used for major-minor chords exercising a dominant function. * minor seventh (mm; m7), or \"minor-minor\". * half-diminished seventh (ø7; dm), or \"diminished-minor\". * fully-diminished seventh (o7; dd), or \"diminished-diminished\".","368850":"PIT-2.C.2: When a chord contains a chord member that possesses this natural inclination to resolve (e.g., a chordal seventh), that specific chord member may be called a chordal dissonance.","368851":"PIT-2.D: Identify seventh chords using Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368852":"PIT-2.D.1: Seventh chords have the potential for a third inversion in which the chordal seventh appears in the bass.","368853":"PIT-2.E: Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative harmonic procedures of 18th-century music.","368854":"PIT-2.E.1: When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. To keep these harmonic progressions plausible and strong, these conventions should be followed- * All implied chords must allow the corresponding soprano notes to make harmonic sense. * An acceptable harmonic progression can be made using tonic, supertonic, subdominant, and dominant triads exclusively, as long as the normative procedures of harmonic progression are followed. * Repeated instances of a specific harmony-that is, repeating a particular chord in a particular position (root-position or inversion)-are acceptable only if the repeated harmonies start on a strong beat. However, at the beginning of a phrase, the repeated harmonies may start on a weak beat.","368855":"PIT-2.E.2: When part-writing secondary dominants, all doubling and voice-leading considerations of normal dominant chords should be maintained (e.g., chordal sevenths resolving down by step).","368856":"PIT-2.E.3: When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. Chromatic pitches may suggest the tonicization of a chord other than the prevailing tonic. One common instance would be a raised scale degree four resolving to scale degree five, a melodic pattern that may suggest tonicization of the dominant chord (V) by means of a secondary dominant chord (V/V).","368857":"PIT-2.F: Use Roman and Arabic numerals to indicate the specific chords and inversions implied by a bass line.","368858":"PIT-2.F.1: Notes of a bass line, especially when combined with other voices, can imply full chords and harmonic progressions.

In completing a Roman-numeral analysis of an outer-voice dictation, all written notes must be accounted for in the analysis.","368862":"PIT-2.H: Identify and describe harmonic function within a chord progression in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368863":"PIT-2.H.1: Music is considered to be tonal when the pitch content is organized around a central (or tonic) pitch and all other pitches relate to that central pitch in a pre-established, hierarchical way. This manner of musical organization is based on a system that prevailed in the tradition known as Western music from approximately 1650 to 1900. Common practice is another term used for this type of music. Tonal organization may also be found in music of other genres and time periods, such as popular music, folk music, and jazz, as well as in some Western music composed after 1900.","368864":"PIT-2.H.2: Harmonic progression (or chord progression) refers to the particular sequence of chords that underlies a musical composition or passage. A harmonic progression may be represented as a succession of Roman numerals corresponding to the specific sequence of chords. When inversions are used, appropriate Arabic numerals are also included.","368865":"PIT-2.H.3: Harmonic rhythm describes the rate at which chords change in a given musical passage or composition. For example, a phrase in 4/4 time starting with chords that change once per measure might subsequently progress to chords changing at a half- or quarter-note pace, demonstrating acceleration of harmonic rhythm.","368866":"PIT-2.H.4: In tonal music, the ordering of chords is governed by a web of relationships, where each chord possesses a contextual role, identified as its function. Based on harmonic context, all chords in a given harmonic progression may be described as fulfilling one of the following functions-tonic, dominant, or predominant.","368867":"PIT-2.H.5: The most fundamental harmonic progression used by tonal composers to establish key is found in the following sequence of harmonic functions-tonic-dominant-tonic","368868":"PIT-2.H.6: Common-practice repertoire includes specific chord successions that are considered normative and usable in the composition of a tonal chord progression. A chord progression that deviates from the norm is generally avoided in the common-practice approach. For instance, V to IV, though common in some styles of popular music, is called a retrogression.","368869":"PIT-2.H.7: To intensify the establishment of key, predominant chords are frequently inserted, resulting in the following order of functions within a harmonic progression or melodic phrase-tonic-predominant-dominant-tonic. Composers generally expand the harmonic background provided by these fundamental progressions by creating a harmonic foreground (or surface) in which chords are ordered in myriad combinations following historical conventions of tonal music.","368870":"PIT-2.H.8: Subdominant (IV or iv) and supertonic (ii or iio) chords often precede the dominant functional area of a phrase, and therefore are referred to as predominant harmonies.","368871":"PIT-2.I: Identify cadence types in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368872":"PIT-2.I.1: Cadence refers to the point of relative repose that concludes a harmonic progression or melodic phrase. Through historical practice, certain chord patterns have emerged as acceptable harmonic formulas for use at cadences. This group of acceptable cadence types fit generally into two categories-inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect authentic, and deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences (i.e., perfect authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic cadence is created by the V-I progression with both harmonies in root position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An imperfect authentic cadence is also a V-I progression, but chords may be inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano. These cadence types influence phrase structure and musical form.","368873":"PIT-2.I.2: Certain harmonic progressions are distinctive enough in sound and/or context to warrant specific labels, such as the Picardy third, a major tonic chord that ends a section in a minor key.","368874":"PIT-2.I.3: Cadences such as the plagal cadence-IV (iv) - I (i)-and Phrygian half cadence-iv6-V, minor only-use predominant function as they conclude a phrase. The deceptive cadence avoids the V-I resolution of authentic cadences by having a non-tonic chord substitute for tonic.","368875":"PIT-2.J: Identify and describe harmonic function and progression in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368876":"PIT-2.J.1: The vi (VI) chord can function as a tonic substitute or as a weaker predominant chord.","368877":"PIT-2.J.2: Certain harmonic progressions are distinctive enough in sound and/or context to warrant specific labels, such as the deceptive progression, with the dominant chord followed by a chord other than the tonic chord, typically the submediant chord.","368878":"PIT-2.J.3: The mediant triad is rarely used in harmonic progressions of 18th-century style music. The mediant triad in a minor key-III-appears more often in its role as representing the relative major key.","368879":"PIT-2.K: Identify the type of six-four chord used in notated music.","368880":"PIT-2.K.1: In composing tonal music, care must be taken in the use of second-inversion triads, or six-four chords, as they may only appear in four specific contexts: cadential six-four, neighboring or pedal six-four, passing six-four, and arpeggiated six-four patterns.","368881":"PIT-2.K.2: The cadential six-four precedes the dominant, often at a cadence. Although it contains the notes of the tonic triad, it does not exercise a tonic function but serves as an embellishment of the dominant. It occurs in a metrically stronger position than the dominant chord, and upper voices most often move by step to the tones of the dominant.","368882":"PIT-2.L: Describe the type of six-four chord used in notated music.","368883":"PIT-2.L.1: The neighboring or pedal six-four occurs when the third and fifth of a root-position triad are embellished by their respective upper neighbor tones while the bass remains stationary. In this pattern, the six-four chord usually occurs on a weak beat.","368884":"PIT-2.L.2: The passing six-four harmonizes the second note of a three-note ascending or descending scale fragment in the bass; it harmonizes a bass passing tone. In this pattern, the six-four chord usually occurs on a weak beat and the motion of the upper voices is ordinarily by step.","368885":"PIT-2.L.3: The arpeggiated six-four results from triad arpeggiation in the bass. With the upper voices sounding a static chord, the bass arpeggiates a complete triad, or alternatively, it oscillates between root and fifth of the chord, as often heard in a waltz or march.","368886":"PIT-2.M: Identify types of embellishing tones, including nonharmonic tones, in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368887":"PIT-2.M.1: To expand individual lines and/or intensify expression, composers often enrich a chordal framework with various types of decorative notes, or embellishing tones. When these notes lie outside the pitch content of the prevailing chord they are called nonharmonic tones, or nonchord tones. Most nonharmonic tones may be classified as a specific type (e.g., passing tone), based on the way the nonharmonic tone is melodically approached and resolved. Rhythmic placement of a nonharmonic tone-i.e., whether it falls directly on a beat or on a division between beats-serves to further define its classification, namely whether it is accented or unaccented.","368888":"PIT-2.M.2: Other terms that relate to nonharmonic tones include embellishment, ornament, trill, preparation, and resolution.","368889":"PIT-2.M.3: Common classifications of nonharmonic tone(s) include passing tone (accented and unaccented) and neighbor tone (including lower neighbor and upper neighbor).","368890":"PIT-2.M.4: Common classifications of nonharmonic tone(s) also include anticipation, escape tone, appoggiatura, and pedal point.","368891":"PIT-2.M.5: Common classifications of nonharmonic tone(s) also include suspension, including rearticulated suspension and chain of suspensions, and retardation.","368892":"PIT-2.N: Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line that incorporates unaccented passing and/or neighbor tones while following the normative harmonic procedures of 18th-century harmony and voice leading.","368893":"PIT-2.N.1: When composing a bass line in 18th-century chorale style, the essential frame of quarter notes may be enlivened by judicious use of eighth-note motion, commonly manifested as unaccented passing and/or neighbor tones. Such embellishing tones can create desirable formations with the soprano when they- * complement a stationary soprano (i.e., two bass eighth notes against a quarter note in the soprano), * move in parallel thirds or sixths with the soprano, * engage in voice exchange with the soprano.","368894":"PIT-2.O: Notate embellishing tones, including nonharmonic tones, indicated in a figured bass or Roman numeral progression.","368895":"PIT-2.O.1: In a figured bass or Roman-numeral progression, Arabic numerals may be used to indicate specific nonharmonic tones such as 4-3 (implying a suspension).","368896":"PIT-2.P: Identify and apply harmonic sequences in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368897":"PIT-2.P.1: Harmonic sequence occurs when a segment of chords is followed immediately by one or more transpositions of the same segment. The interval of transposition is usually held to a constant size-for instance, a sequence up a third, if continued, will be followed by additional transpositions up a third. Harmonic sequence sometimes occurs with a corresponding melodic sequence.","368898":"PIT-2.Q: Identify and describe tonicization in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368899":"PIT-2.Q.1: The particular key that starts and ends a given work is that work's tonic, or primary, key. However, scale degrees or chords other than the tonic may be made to sound as if they are temporary tonics; the process of achieving this is called tonicization. Tonicization possesses a fleeting quality due to its relatively brief duration and the lack of a clear cadence in the new key. Tonicization is a local harmonic event that does not change the primary key of the music. Diatonic scale degrees from the primary key are altered to achieve tonicization; these altered scale degrees are shown with accidentals in notated music.","368900":"PIT-2.Q.2: The most common way to effect tonicization is through use of a secondary dominant (or applied dominant) chord. A major or minor triad other than the actual tonic chord is preceded by its own dominant chord, the secondary (or applied) dominant, allowing the original triad to be felt as a temporary tonic (i.e., tonicized). For instance, the V chord in the key of C major (a G major triad) could be preceded by its own dominant or dominant seventh chord, which would be spelled D-F♯-A and D-F♯-A-C, respectively. In this example, this \"V of V\" chord (notated V/V) would resolve to and tonicize the V chord of the original key, exploiting the power of a dominant-to-tonic progression to assert a new, albeit temporary, tonic. Although the dominant (V) is the most common chord to be tonicized by its own secondary dominant (V/V), any major or minor triad may also be tonicized through use of a secondary dominant, such as V/ii resolving to ii or V/IV resolving to IV. Secondary dominants nearly always require accidentals in their spelling, and they may appear as triads or dominant seventh chords in any inversion appropriate to the harmonic context.","368901":"PIT-2.Q.3: As with secondary (or applied) dominants, secondary leading-tone chords or secondary diminished seventh chords (also referred to as applied leading-tone chords or applied diminished seventh chords) may also be used to tonicize any major or minor triad in a given key. Secondary leading-tone chords are diminished triads and diminished seventh chords (fully or half-diminished) whose root is the leading tone of the chord being tonicized. A \"viio7 of V\" (notated viio7/V) tonicizes the V chord and is built on raised scale degree four of the original key; in another example, viio7/ii would tonicize the ii chord and would be built on raised scale degree one of the original key. As with normal leading-tone chords, the triad only appears in first-inversion (i.e., viio6), but seventh chords may appear in any inversion appropriate to the harmonic context. Because the half-diminished leading-tone chord only appears in the major mode, secondary leading-tone chords that are half-diminished in quality may only be used to tonicize major triads.","368902":"PIT-3: Melody-Pitches that are deliberately sequenced through time produce an expressive musical statement known as a melody.","368903":"PIT-3.A: Sight-sing the pitches and rhythms of a melody that is notated in treble or bass clef.","368904":"PIT-3.A.1: Accurate performance of a notated melody rests largely on accurate rendering of the notated pitches. Even when a melody is transposed to a key other than the notated key, melodic intervals separating pitches are retained, allowing the melody to retain its characteristic sound.","368905":"PIT-3.A.2: Although complete pitch accuracy is the goal, a sight-singing performance demonstrates partial mastery when it retains the tonic pitch or approximates the melody with correct contour.","368906":"PIT-3.A.3: In performing rhythm, it is important to sustain notes for their full duration, especially on cadential notes where inexperienced performers may be tempted to cut short the duration.","368907":"PIT-3.B: Notate the pitches and rhythms of a performed melody- a. in treble or bass clef b. composed in a major key","368908":"PIT-3.B.1: Accurate dictation of a performed melody depends on accurate identification of the relationship of the pitches to the tonic and the notation of the sounding pitches and rhythms. Pitches are accurately notated when they are spelled correctly in the given key and placed in the proper octave.","368909":"PIT-3.C: Identify features of melody in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368910":"PIT-3.C.1: Melody is produced by pitch and rhythm together, combining to create a succession of pitches through time that express a musical statement.","368911":"PIT-3.C.2: Melodies may be derived from specific scales and modes and are often organized in patterns of musical motives and phrases.","368912":"PIT-3.C.3: The pitch succession that comprises a melody may exhibit several technical features. Contour is the unique melodic shape created by the specific rise and fall of pitches. Conjunct and disjunct refer to melodic steps (conjunct) or leaps (disjunct) within a melody or melodic segment. Register refers to the relative span of pitch (e.g., high, medium, or low) of notes in a given melody or part thereof. Range refers to the overall compass of pitch in a given melody, from its lowest to its highest pitch.","368913":"PIT-3.C.4: Motive refers to a small musical idea that recurs and is developed through the course of a musical composition or passage. A motive may be compositionally developed by pitch alone, rhythm alone, or the complete pitch-rhythm combination.","368914":"PIT-3.C.5: In vocal music, text (known in popular music as lyrics) is set to melody, and elements of text and pitch may relate in one of two ways- * When each syllable of text corresponds to a single pitch, the text setting is said to be syllabic. * When a syllable of text is sung with two or more pitches, the text setting is said to be melismatic; each instance of one syllable to multiple pitches is a melisma.","368915":"PIT-3.C.6: Melodic transposition is a commonly used form of pitch transformation; it is also a useful skill frequently required of practicing musicians. In melodic transposition, a melody or melodic segment is moved to a new pitch level while retaining its intervallic and rhythmic content. For instance, a C major melody transposed up a whole step would result in the same tune sounding a whole step higher; it would now be in the key of D major.","368916":"PIT-3.D: Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative melodic procedures of 18th-century music.","368917":"PIT-3.D.1: Melodic interest in a bass line may be created by balancing upward and downward motion and by balancing melodic steps and leaps.","368918":"PIT-3.D.2: A bass line uses melodic leaps with greater frequency than upper voices or parts, which tend toward more stepwise motion. Allowable leaps include thirds, perfect fourths and fifths, sixths, and octaves, and, if resolved properly, descending diminished fifths. Octave leaps should be followed by changes in direction. The bass line may include successive leaps in the same direction as long as the pitches outline a triad.","368919":"PIT-3.D.3: Repeated bass notes are acceptable only if they start on a strong beat. However, the repeated notes may start on a weak beat if it is the beginning of a phrase or if the second note is a suspension.","368920":"PIT-3.E: Identify and apply melodic procedures in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368921":"PIT-3.E.1: To enrich their works, composers often develop motives, melodic segments, or entire melodies using melodic procedures that transform those original ideas in various ways and are therefore sometimes called motivic transformation or thematic transformation. Some procedures focus solely on rhythmic transformation (e.g., augmentation), some procedures focus solely on pitch transformation (e.g., melodic inversion), and some procedures transform both pitch and rhythm (e.g., retrograde).","368922":"PIT-3.E.2: Melodic sequence occurs when a melodic segment is followed immediately by one or more transpositions of the same segment. The interval of transposition is usually held to a constant size-for instance, a sequence up a third, if continued, will be followed by additional transpositions up a third. Melodic sequence may occur with a corresponding harmonic sequence.","368923":"PIT-4: Voice Leading-Individual voices of a composition are imbued with a cohesive sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.","368924":"PIT-4.A: Identify and apply the procedures of 18th-century voice leading through- a. score analysis. b. error detection. c. writing exercises. d. contextual listening.","368925":"PIT-4.A.1: Voice leading describes how individual voices or parts move as a harmonic progression advances from each chord to the next. This motion must take into consideration correct chord spelling, spacing, and doubling. Emulating works of the common-practice era, voice leading should achieve linear smoothness and bring about independence of voices (or parts). Additionally, tendency tones are resolved according to stylistic precedent (e.g., a chordal seventh resolving down by step).","368926":"PIT-4.A.10: Seventh chords in inversion often connect chords in an extended progression allowing the bass to have a melodic stepwise quality. Voice leading into and out of these inverted seventh chords is typically smooth, with no or minimal leaps.","368927":"PIT-4.A.11: Leading tone seventh chords-the viio7 (fully-diminished) and viiø7 (half-diminished)-have two possible functions-to substitute for the V or V7 chord as part of the dominant or, placed between tonic chords, to prolong the tonic in stepwise voice leading.","368928":"PIT-4.A.12: Inverted seventh chords should be spelled completely. Any tendency tones should appear individually (i.e., not doubled) and should be resolved according to the tendency.","368929":"PIT-4.A.13: Predominant seventh chords fulfill the same harmonic function as predominant triads. As with most seventh chords, the chordal seventh should resolve by a descending step. In some cases, the chordal seventh may be retained in the same voice before resolving down by step, such as when ii7 moves to a cadential six-four chord.","368930":"PIT-4.A.14: When part-writing secondary leading-tone chords, all doubling and voice leading considerations of normal leading-tone chords should be maintained (e.g., chordal sevenths resolving down by step).","368931":"PIT-4.A.2: The linear movement between two given voices can happen in four ways- * parallel motion-voices move in the same direction (both up or both down) by the same melodic interval. * similar motion-voices move in the same direction, but not by the same melodic interval. * oblique motion-one voice remains stationary while the second moves up or down. * contrary motion-voices move in opposite directions.","368932":"PIT-4.A.3: Following are general conventions of 18th-century voice leading- * Voice leading should proceed mostly by step without excessive leaps. * When possible, pitches common to adjacent chords, or common tones, should be retained in the same voice part(s). * For clarity of voice leading, any chord should maintain soprano-alto-tenor-bass (SATB) order from high to low to avoid voice crossing. * If a perfect fifth between two voices is not immediately repeated, it should proceed to an interval other than another perfect fifth between the same voices. This applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel fifths) as well as contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats. * If a perfect octave or unison between two voices is not immediately repeated it should proceed to an interval other than another perfect octave or perfect unison between the same voices. This applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel octaves) as well as contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats. * All voices should proceed melodically with the following intervals-major and minor second, major and minor third, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth. All melodic augmented and diminished intervals should be excluded, as they produce uncharacteristic dissonances. All melodic intervals larger than a perfect fifth should also be excluded, as they create uncharacteristic disjunct motion. * The leading tone in an outer voice (i.e., soprano or bass) should always resolve up by step to avoid an unresolved leading tone.","368933":"PIT-4.A.4: When composing outer voices, the normative conventions of 18th-century voice leading should be maintained (e.g., avoid parallel fifths). In addition- * Outer voices may include leading tones as long as those leading tones-are not doubled in another voice, and resolve to the tonic by ascending in stepwise motion, to avoid an unresolved leading tone. * Note-against-note dissonances between outer voices may be included only if they imply an acceptable harmonic progression-for example, a note-against-note fourth would work only as part of an acceptable pattern of second-inversion chords, such as the cadential, neighboring (pedal), or passing six-four chord patterns. A chromatically inflected pitch that is appropriate in the musical context may be included as long as the pre-inflected pitch does not appear in another voice directly preceding the inflected pitch in question (i.e., avoid a cross relation).","368934":"PIT-4.A.5: When chords are spaced in close position, all upper parts (i.e., all parts except the bass) are placed as close together as chord tones will allow. Any other spacing is considered an open position.","368935":"PIT-4.A.6: When composing music in a four-voice texture, the normative conventions for writing chordal sevenths should be followed.","368936":"PIT-4.A.7: When part writing, chordal sevenths should be approached by common tone or by step. When the voice leading context precludes these options, chordal sevenths may also be approached by ascending leap, or (rarely) by a descending leap of a third.","368937":"PIT-4.A.8: All chordal sevenths should resolve by a descending step, to avoid an unresolved seventh. However, the chordal seventh in a second-inversion dominant seventh chord may move up by step when appearing in a progression of root-position tonic to second-inversion dominant seventh to first-inversion tonic. In some cases, the chordal seventh may be retained in the same voice before eventually resolving down by a step.","368938":"PIT-4.A.9: The fifth of a root-position dominant seventh chord may be omitted if it helps the voice leading. When the fifth is omitted in a root-position seventh chord, the root should be doubled.

One common exception to this convention occurs in the progression of root-position tonic to second-inversion dominant seventh to first-inversion tonic, where a harmonic diminished fifth may rise to a perfect fifth. The most natural resolution of a diminished fifth is inward to a third. * If outer voices move to a perfect interval by similar motion, the upper voice should proceed by step. Avoid direct fifths and direct octaves (also known as hidden fifths and hidden octaves). * A voice, in moving to its next pitch, should never cross over an adjacent voice's current pitch, to avoid overlapping voices.

The three upper voices are stationary and only the bass moves.","368957":"PIT-4.F.4: When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. To keep these harmonic progressions plausible and strong, these conventions should be followed- * Six-four chords may appear in tonally appropriate contexts as long as they are rhythmically appropriate to their context-that is, cadential six-fours occur on a strong beat and passing or neighboring (pedal) six-fours on a weak beat. * A chord may proceed to any other chord except for one that results in a poor chord succession,, e.g., Avoid V-IV, V-ii, ii-iii, IV-iii, ii-I, V-vi6, and iii-viio, etc. * Any chord may be implied as long as it does not result in poor chord use. Poor chord use could include-root-position viio, vi6 (unless as part of a modulation, parallel motion by first-inversion chords, or other acceptable diatonic sequence), and iii6 (unless as part of parallel motion by first-inversion chords or other acceptable diatonic sequence).","368958":"RHY: Rhythm","368959":"RHY-1: Rhythm and meter-Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short sounds and silences can be combined in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses known as meter.","368960":"RHY-1.A: Identify the rhythmic values of notes and rests in- a. performed music b. notated music","368961":"RHY-1.A.1: Rhythmic values symbolize the duration of a note or rest. The duration of notes and rests can be extended using ties and augmentation dots (single dots and double dots).","368962":"RHY-1.B: Describe beat division and meter type in- a. performed music b. notated music","368963":"RHY-1.B.1: In most music, rhythm is governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses called meter. Meter is fundamentally based on three interlocking pulse speeds (beat, beat division, and measure).","368964":"RHY-1.B.2: A meter in which the beat is parsed into two divisions is called simple, and a meter in which the beat is parsed into three divisions is called compound.","368965":"RHY-1.C: Describe the meter type in- a. performed music b. notated music","368966":"RHY-1.C.1: Meter types are identified based on two relationships-the relationship of the beat to the division (simple versus compound) and the relationship of the beat to the measure. A meter in which the beat is grouped into two-beat measures is called duple, and meters in which the beats are grouped into three- and four-beat measures are called triple and quadruple, respectively. For example, meter known as common time (4/4) would be considered a simple quadruple meter- \"simple\" because its quarter-note beat parses into two eighth-note divisions and \"quadruple\" because its beat groups into four-beat measures.","368967":"RHY-1.D: Describe the time signature in- a. performed music b. notated music","368968":"RHY-1.D.1: Time signatures (or meter signatures) represent meter in a score. The upper and lower numbers of a time signature work together to imply how many beats are in a measure, which rhythmic value gets one beat, and whether the meter is simple or compound. More specifically- The upper number of a time signature reveals whether the meter is simple (2, 3, or 4) or compound (6, 9, or 12), and whether the meter is duple (2 or 6), triple (3 or 9), or quadruple (4 or 12). The lower number represents the rhythmic value of the beat in simple meters and the rhythmic value of the division in compound meters. To illustrate, in a simple meter such as 3/8, the upper number indicates a simple triple meter, and the lower number shows that the eighth note gets the beat. In a compound meter such as 9/8, the upper number indicates a compound triple meter, and the lower number shows that the eighth note is the division. Each measure of 9/8 contains nine eighth-note divisions, and each group of three divisions forms a dotted-quarter beat.","368969":"RHY-1.D.2: Metrical accents arise from patterns of strong and weak beats that occur at regularly occurring intervals in a meter. At the beat level, the first beat of a measure, called the downbeat, is always strongest; the subsequent beats in the measure are felt as weak beats and, in some cases, lesser strong beats. In a measure of 4/4, beat one is the downbeat, beat three constitutes a lesser strong beat, and beats two and four fill out the measure as weak beats. At the division level, divisions occurring directly on beats are felt as strong in relation to the intervening divisions, or offbeats, which are comparatively weak.","368970":"RHY-1.E: Identify irregularities of beat division and/or beat grouping into measures in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368971":"RHY-1.E.1: Borrowed divisions occur when compound divisions (three divisions per beat) substitute for division values in a simple meter (two divisions per beat), and vice versa. Such divisions are sometimes called triplets and duplets, respectively. Borrowed rhythmic values may also occur at the beat level; for instance, three quarter note triplets may take the place of two quarter notes. Beats may be divided into other portions (such as 5s and 7s), sometimes called irregular divisions.","368972":"RHY-1.E.2: Meter types created by recurring regularly spaced patterns of accent on the different levels of pulse (division, beat, and measure) are called symmetrical meters. However, meters are not always regularly periodic at all levels of pulse. For instance, 5/8 contains beats of unequal size, with the first beat containing three eighth-note divisions and the second containing two eighth-note divisions, or vice versa. This is an example of an asymmetrical or irregular meter. Music may use time signatures that shift often, such as a measure of 3/4 followed by a measure of 4/4; this is known as changing or mixed meter.","368973":"RHY-2: Rhythmic patterns-Musical sounds and silences may be produced individually but are typically grouped into distinctive rhythmic patterns. These patterns help define the specific identity of a musical passage as it combines with other passages to form larger rhythmic formations.","368974":"RHY-2.A: For rhythmic patterns in simple and compound meter- a. Identify the rhythmic pattern. b. Notate the rhythmic pattern. c. Sight-sing the rhythmic pattern.","368975":"RHY-2.A.1: Rhythmic patterns arise from the various ways rhythmic values can fill up a beat. Simple beats have a limited number of rhythmic patterns; compound beats have only a few more possible rhythmic patterns. Learning and knowing these rhythmic patterns by sight and sound facilitates reading, notating, and analyzing music. Rhythmic patterns may be identified in performed excerpts and in scores, notated from performed excerpts, and performed through sight-singing. Some rhythmic patterns are so common and distinctive that they have names, such as dotted rhythms.","368976":"RHY-2.A.2: In notating rhythm, care should be taken to sequence rhythmic values and draw beams so the location of beats is most clearly visible. There may be no beaming across the half-bar (e.g. across beats 2 and 3 in quadruple meter). Notes, rests, ties, and beams that obscure the beat structure of a measure are difficult for the performer to interpret and considered wrong.","368977":"RHY-2.B: Identify rhythmic discrepancies between notated and performed music in one or two voices.","368978":"RHY-2.B.1: A musical score shows notation of the specific rhythms to be performed. Except for musical styles that allow for improvisation and ornamentation, performed rhythms should not deviate from the score. Swing rhythms are an example of a musical style that allows rhythms to deviate from their notation; the addition of the word \"swing\" indicates that the offbeat note should occur later than it would ordinarily.","368979":"RHY-2.C: Compose the rhythmic aspects of a bass line added to a given soprano line, following conventions of the 18th-century chorale.","368980":"RHY-2.C.1: Bass lines in 18th-century chorales tend to follow a particular rhythmic profile. Although they may feature note values ranging from half notes to eighth notes, the quarter note is the most frequent rhythmic value. A bass line of a chorale notated in 4/4 time that makes exclusive or almost exclusive use of half notes would be atypical of the style.","368981":"RHY-3: Rhythmic devices-Musicians use established rhythmic devices to expand expressive possibilities. These devices often achieve their effect by challenging the regularity of meter or transforming rhythmic patterns.","368982":"RHY-3.A: Identify rhythmic devices in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368983":"RHY-3.A.1: A variety of rhythmic devices and features are used in music. Some features enliven rhythm by challenging the regularity of an established meter. For example, syncopation occurs when rhythm places accent on weak beats or divisions. A cross-rhythm (or polyrhythm) is a simultaneous occurrence of two or more rhythmic patterns that do not derive from one another and are not rooted in the same meter. Hemiola, in its most fundamental meaning, refers to any arrangement of rhythm and meter that articulates a 3 to 2 ratio. Thus, hemiola occurs when three notes of equal duration take up the time previously held by two notes of equal duration, or vice versa. Common manifestations of hemiola include the following- * Measures of compound duple meter (e.g., 6/8) juxtaposed with measures that articulate a simple triple meter (e.g., 3/4), with the division pulse remaining constant (e.g., a static eighth-note pulse). * Two measures of triple meter that are accented as Strong-weak-Strong-weak-Strong-weak instead of the usual Strong-weak-weak-Strong-weak-weak.","368984":"RHY-3.A.2: Other rhythmic devices include the following- * An agogic accent is a note that naturally receives more emphasis due to its extended (or longer) duration. * An anacrusis, or pickup, is a rhythm or rhythms that start before the first downbeat of a phrase. * A fermata is a symbol placed over a note or rest that indicates it is to be held longer than its normal duration.","368985":"RHY-3.B: Identify and apply procedures used to transform rhythmic patterns in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","368986":"RHY-3.B.1: Rhythmic patterns can be transformed.

Some features enliven rhythm by challenging the regularity of an established meter. For example, syncopation occurs when rhythm places accent on weak beats or divisions. A cross-rhythm (or polyrhythm) is a simultaneous occurrence of two or more rhythmic patterns that do not derive from one another and are not rooted in the same meter. Hemiola, in its most fundamental meaning, refers to any arrangement of rhythm and meter that articulates a 3 to 2 ratio. Thus, hemiola occurs when three notes of equal duration take up the time previously held by two notes of equal duration, or vice versa. Common manifestations of hemiola include the following- * Measures of compound duple meter (e.g., 6/8) juxtaposed with measures that articulate a simple triple meter (e.g., 3/4), with the division pulse remaining constant (e.g., a static eighth-note pulse). * Two measures of triple meter that are accented as Strong-weak-Strong-weak-Strong-weak instead of the usual Strong-weak-weak-Strong-weak-weak.","parentId":368982,"children":[],"externalKey":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.0","internalName":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.0"},"368984":{"id":368984,"categoryId":23322,"label":"RHY-3.A.2","description":"RHY-3.A.2: Other rhythmic devices include the following- * An agogic accent is a note that naturally receives more emphasis due to its extended (or longer) duration. * An anacrusis, or pickup, is a rhythm or rhythms that start before the first downbeat of a phrase. * A fermata is a symbol placed over a note or rest that indicates it is to be held longer than its normal duration.","parentId":368982,"children":[],"externalKey":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.1","internalName":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.0.1"},"368985":{"id":368985,"categoryId":23322,"label":"RHY-3.B","description":"RHY-3.B: Identify and apply procedures used to transform rhythmic patterns in- a. performed music. b. notated music.","parentId":368981,"children":[368986],"externalKey":"19.apmuth.0.3.2.1","internalName":"2019-AP-Music-Theory-Framework-19.apmuth.0.3.2.1"},"368986":{"id":368986,"categoryId":23322,"label":"RHY-3.B.1","description":"RHY-3.B.1: Rhythmic patterns can be transformed.
