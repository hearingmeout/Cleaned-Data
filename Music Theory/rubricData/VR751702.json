The column on the left is labeled Egregious Errors. The column on the right is labeled Minor Errors.  The following are the egregious errors listed in the left-side column: A.1. Parallel fifths or octaves, consecutive perfect fifths or octaves in contrary motion (marked on the second chord); A.2. Doubling the leading tone (marked on the first chord), unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone (marked on the first chord); A.3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); A.4. Unresolved seventh or incorrectly resolved seventh (marked on the first chord); A.5. Other note-against-note dissonance (including fourths) that is not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note (marked on the first chord); A.6. Poor chord succession (e.g., five to four, five to three, five to two, two to three, four to three, two to one, three to one, six to one, three to two, three to diminished seven, etc.) (marked on the second chord); A.7. Root-position leading-tone chord (diminished seven) followed by anything other than root-position I (marked on the first chord); A.8. Poor chord use, such as six-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence, modulation, or following a strong-beat one—i.e., a five-six motion); three-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence) (marked on the first chord); A.9. Inappropriate leap (seventh, augmented interval, or compound interval), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, descending leap of more than a third into a chordal seventh, or leap of an octave that does not change direction afterwards (marked on the last chord of the leap(s)); A.10. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (applicable to only phrases three and four); and A.11. Use of an unacceptable rhythmic value, including any rests. The following are the minor errors listed in the right-side column: B.1. Diminished fifth to perfect fifth (marked on the second chord); B.4. Approach to fifth or octave in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps (marked on the second chord); B.3. Metrically inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); B.8. Incomplete inverted seventh chord; B.5. Cross relation (marked on the first chord); B.2. Repeated note and/or Roman numeral (and inversion) from weak beat to strong beat, unless at start of phrase (marked on the second chord); B.6. Root-position diminished seven triad that moves directly to one (marked on the first chord); and B.7. Four or more consecutive thirds or sixths for half of a phrase.\"></p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3],"maxScores":[3,3,3,3],"descriptions":["<p>Bass line and Roman numerals are poor. </p>","<p>Bass line is poor and Roman numerals are good to fair.</p><p></p><p>OR</p><p></p><p>Bass line is fair and Roman numerals are poor.</p><p></p><p>OR</p><p></p><p>Only the cadence of the phrase is good: the final two Roman numerals (and inversions) match the final two bass notes. </p>","<p>Bass line is fair and Roman numerals are good to fair.</p><p></p><p>OR</p><p></p><p>Bass line is good and Roman numerals are poor. </p>","<p>Bass line is good and Roman numerals are good to fair.
