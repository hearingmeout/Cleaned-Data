Score each phrase separately and then add the phrase scores together to arrive at a preliminary tally for the entire response.</p><p>B. Before deciding on the final score for the entire response, consider giving 1 point to a response that is either extremely good or that would otherwise receive a score of 0 (see III.B.).</p><p>C. Except for instances where the guidelines specify otherwise, judge the bass and Roman numerals separately and ignore mismatches between them.</p><p>D. Errors are categorized as either minor or egregious. Two minor errors equal one egregious error (see II. Weighting Errors).</p><h3><strong>II. Weighting Errors</strong></h3><p>A. The following are <strong>egregious</strong> errors:</p><p>1. Blatant violations of the instructions</p><p>2. Parallel octaves or fifths, or diminished fifth to perfect fifth</p><p>3. Doubling the leading tone; unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone</p><p>4. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (N.B.: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed.)</p><p>5. Unresolved sevenths or incorrectly resolved sevenths</p><p>6. Other note-against-note dissonances (including fourths) that are not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note</p><p>7. Poor chord succession (e.g., Ⅴ–Ⅳ; Ⅴ–ii; ii–iii; Ⅳ–iii, ii–I; Ⅴ–vi6; iii–viio, etc.)</p><p>8. Root-position leading-tone chord (viio) followed by anything other than root-position I</p><p>9. Poor chord use, such as vi6 (unless as part of a parallel sequence or modulation); iii6 (unless as part of a parallel sequence)</p><p>10. Inappropriate leaps (sevenths, augmented fourths, augmented seconds, compound intervals, etc.), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, or leaps of an octave that do not change direction</p><p>11. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (applicable to phrases 3 and 4)</p><p>B. The following are <strong>minor</strong> errors (two minor errors = one egregious error):</p><p>1.Repeated notes and/or Roman numerals and inversions from weak beat to strong beat (unless at start of phrase, or if the second note is a suspension)</p><p>2. Metrically inappropriate six-four chords</p><p>3. Approach to octave or fifth in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps, or consecutive perfect fifths and octaves in contrary motion</p><p>4. Cross-relations</p><p>5. Root-position viio triads that move directly to I</p><p>6. Four or more consecutive thirds or sixths for half of a phrase</p><p>C. The following errors are marked on the first chord:</p><p>1. Incorrectly resolved or unresolved leading tones, chordal sevenths, or incorrect dissonances (see II.A.6.)</p><p>2. Poor chord use (e.g., vi6, iii6, etc.)</p><p>3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord</p><p>4. Cross relations</p><p>D. The following errors are marked on the second chord:</p><p>1. Parallel fifths and octaves</p><p>2. Hidden fifths and octaves</p><p>3. Unequal fifths (diminished fifth to perfect fifth)</p><p>4. Inappropriate leaps</p><p>5. Successive nontriadic leaps</p><p>6. Poor chord progression</p><h3><strong>III. Other Considerations</strong></h3><p>A. General considerations:</p><p>1. Consider each phrase independently; do not judge the connections between each phrase.</p><p>2. Ignore any inner voices supplied by the students; ignore any/all extraneous labels (nonchord tones, etc.).</p><p>3. Judge the bass line as either part of a contrapuntal two-part framework or as a bass line for a four-part harmony exercise, giving the student the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>4. In judging harmonies, always consider the implied bass line suggested by the Roman numerals (and inversions).</p><p>B. Special scores:</p><p>1. Award 1 point for a truly musical response or for a response that is solid throughout.</p><p>2. Award 1 point to a response that otherwise would earn a 0 but that has two or more redeeming qualities.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point"],"values":[0,1],"maxScores":[1,1],"descriptions":["<p>The response demonstrates one of the following:</p>","<p>The response demonstrates one of the following:</p>"]},{"id":"VR020430-22_rubric_category_1","type":"custom","title":"Part IV: “Start Here” Phrase","stimulusHtml":"<p>IV.
