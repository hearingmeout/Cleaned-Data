For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1 = 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the additional point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Record any score of 4 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p><strong>D.</strong> If after applying 1.A and 1.B the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p><strong>E.</strong> If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p><strong>F.</strong> For ease of scoring, the Alternate Scoring Guides have been accounted for in the point-value options presented. However, <em>scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</em></p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">II.
