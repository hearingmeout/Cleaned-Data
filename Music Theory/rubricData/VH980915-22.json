Parallel fifths or octaves, consecutive perfect fifths or octaves in contrary motion (marked on the second chord), Note: Perfect fifths to diminished fifths are OK, though some may create other problems with incorrect resolutions and/or chordal sevenths (marked on the second chord); A.2. Doubling the leading tone (marked on the first chord), unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone (marked on the first  chord), Note: A bass line that moves from scale degree one to seven to six is OK, i.e. not an unresolved leading tone; A.3. Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord), Note: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed; A.4. Unresolved seventh or incorrectly resolved seventh (marked on the first chord); A.5. Other note-against-note dissonance (including fourths) that is not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note (marked on the first chord); A.6. Poor chord succession (e.g.,  five to four, five to two, two to three, four to three, two to one, three to one, six to one, five to three, three to two, three to diminished seven, etc.) (marked on the second chord), Note: Motions from five or five-six to four-six are allowed.; A.7. Root-position leading-tone chord (diminished seven) followed by anything other than root-position I (marked on the first chord); A.8. Poor chord use, such as six-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three  sequence, modulation, or following a strong-beat one—i.e., a five-six motion); three-six (unless as part of a parallel six-three sequence) (marked on the first chord); A.9. Inappropriate leap (seventh, augmented interval, or compound interval), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, descending leap of more than a third into a chordal seventh, or leap of an octave that does not change direction afterwards (marked on the last chord of the leap(s)), Note: Leaps of diminished intervals that change direction and resolve by step afterwards are allowed; A.10. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (not applicable to “Start Here” phrase); and A.11. Use of an unacceptable rhythmic value, including all rests. The following are the minor errors listed in the right-side column: B.1. Diminished fifth to perfect fifth (marked on the second chord); B.2. Approach to fifth or octave in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps (marked on the second chord); B.3. Metrically inappropriate six-four chord (marked on the first chord); B.4. Incomplete inverted seventh chord; B.5. Cross relation (marked on the first chord); B.6. Repeated note and/or Roman numeral (and inversion) from weak beat to strong beat, unless at start of phrase (marked on the second chord); B.7. Root-position diminished seven triad that moves directly to one (marked on the first chord); and B.8. Four or more consecutive thirds or sixths for half of a phrase.\"></p><p><em>One possible 6-point response is shown below.
