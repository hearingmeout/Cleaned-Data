The lower staff is in the bass clef and the upper staff is in the treble clef. There is no key signature and the time signature is common time. The score consists of chords of two notes and roman numeral analysis is given below the staff. The key is given as a minor. The chords are made of of two notes each and there are four chords of quarter notes in measures 1 and 2, and one chord of whole notes in measure 3. The first chord in measure 1 has A2 in the bass clef and E5 in the treble clef. The second chord has C3 in the bass and E5 in the treble clef. The third chord has D3 in the bass and D5 in the treble. The fourth chord has E3 in the bass and B4 in the treble The analysis below shows: minor 1, minor 1 6, minor 4, and major 5. There is a dotted line box around the notes and analysis of the first chord in measure 1. The first chord in measure 2 has C3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef. The second chord has D3 in the bass and B4 in the treble clef. The third chord has E3 in the bass and C5 in the treble. The fourth chord has E2 in the bass and B4 in the treble The analysis below shows: minor 1 6, minor 2 half diminished 6 5, minor 1 6 4, and major 5. The last two chords in measure 2 are also labeled as major 5 6 4 going to 5 3. The final chord has A2 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef. The analysis is minor 1. Discussion II.E: The figure shows nine possible pairs of chords with the number of points awarded for each example. The first example has major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3 and the points shown are 1 point for each chord. the next example shows major 5 6 4 going to 5 3 with one point for the first chord and half for the second. The third example shows major 5 6 4 and then blank with 1 point and zero points. The fourth example shows major 5 followed by major 5 7, with half a point and one point awarded. The fifth example shows major 5 6 4 and major 1 with zero points for both. The next example shows major 1 6 4 and major 4 with one point and zero points. The seventh example shows major 5 and major 5, both awarded half a point. The eighth example shows major 5 and a dash, with half a point and half a point. The final example shows major 5 6 4 and major 5 6 4 with one point and half a point.\"></p><p><strong>Chord Symbols (8 points)</strong></p><li><p>Award 1 point for each chord symbol correct in both Roman and Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Award ½ point for each correct Roman numeral that has incorrect or missing Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Accept the correct Roman numeral regardless of its case.</p></li><li><p>Accept “ii” (or “II”) as a correct Roman numeral even without a half-diminished symbol.</p></li><li><p>The cadential six-four may be correctly notated as shown in the key above.
