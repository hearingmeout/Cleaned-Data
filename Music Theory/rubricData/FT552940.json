The first example has major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3 and the points shown are 1 point for each chord. the next example shows major 5 6 4 going to 5 3 with one point for the first chord and half for the second. The third example shows major 5 6 4 and then blank with 1 point and zero points. The fourth example shows major 5 followed by major 5 7, with half a point and one point awarded. The fifth example shows major 5 6 4 and major 1 with zero points for both. The next example shows major 1 6 4 and major 4 with one point and zero points. The seventh example shows major 5 and major 5, both awarded half a point. The eighth example shows major 5 and a dash, with half a point and half a point. The final example shows major 5 6 4 and major 5 6 4 with one point and half a point.\"></p><p><strong>Chord Symbols (8 points)</strong></p><li><p>Award 1 point for each chord symbol correct in both Roman and Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Award ½ point for each correct Roman numeral that has incorrect or missing Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Accept the correct Roman numeral regardless of its case.</p></li><li><p>Accept any symbol that means “of” or “applied” at Chord Six (e.g., V/V, [V], V→V, V of V, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Accept a <em>capital</em> II for the Roman numeral of Chord Six</p></li><li><p>The cadential six-four may be correctly notated as shown in the key above.

The chords are made of of two notes each and there are two chords of half notes in each measure apart from the last measure which has one chord of whole notes. The first chord in measure 1 has F3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef. The second chord has D3 in the bass and B flat 4 in the treble clef. The analysis shows: major 1 and major 4 6.

The chords are made of of two notes each and there are two chords of half notes in each measure apart from the last measure which has one chord of whole notes. The first chord in measure 1 has F3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef. The second chord has D3 in the bass and B flat 4 in the treble clef. The analysis shows: major 1 and major 4 6. There is a dotted line box around the notes and analysis of the first chord in measure 1. The first chord in measure 2 has E3 in the bass and C5 in the treble. The second chord has C3 in the bass and E5 in the treble The analysis below shows: major 5 6 and major 5 7. The first chord in measure 3 has D3 in the bass clef and F5 in the treble clef. The second chord has B natural 2 in the bass and D5 in the treble clef. The analysis shows: minor 6 and dominant major 5 6 5 of major 5. The first chord in measure 4 has C3 in the bass and C5 in the treble. The second chord has C3 in the bass and B flat 4 in the treble The analysis below shows two options for chord progressions: one option is major 1 6 4 and major 5 7, and the other option is major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3. The final chord has F2 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef. The analysis is major 1. The figure shows nine possible pairs of chords with the number of points awarded for each example. The first example has major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3 and the points shown are 1 point for each chord. the next example shows major 5 6 4 going to 5 3 with one point for the first chord and half for the second. The third example shows major 5 6 4 and then blank with 1 point and zero points. The fourth example shows major 5 followed by major 5 7, with half a point and one point awarded. The fifth example shows major 5 6 4 and major 1 with zero points for both. The next example shows major 1 6 4 and major 4 with one point and zero points. The seventh example shows major 5 and major 5, both awarded half a point. The eighth example shows major 5 and a dash, with half a point and half a point. The final example shows major 5 6 4 and major 5 6 4 with one point and half a point.\"></p><p><strong>Chord Symbols (8 points)</strong></p><li><p>Award 1 point for each chord symbol correct in both Roman and Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Award ½ point for each correct Roman numeral that has incorrect or missing Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Accept the correct Roman numeral regardless of its case.</p></li><li><p>Accept any symbol that means “of” or “applied” at Chord Six (e.g., V/V, [V], V→V, V of V, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Accept a <em>capital</em> II for the Roman numeral of Chord Six</p></li><li><p>The cadential six-four may be correctly notated as shown in the key above.
