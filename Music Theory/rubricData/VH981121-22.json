Doubling the leading tone; unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone</p><p>4.

Inappropriate leaps (sevenths, augmented fourths, augmented seconds, compound intervals, etc.), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, or leaps of an octave that do not change direction</p><p>11. An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (applicable to phrases 3 and 4)</p><p>B. The following are <strong>minor</strong> errors (two minor errors = one egregious error):</p><p>1.Repeated notes and/or Roman numerals and inversions from weak beat to strong beat (unless at start of phrase, or if the second note is a suspension)</p><p>2. Metrically inappropriate six-four chords</p><p>3. Approach to octave or fifth in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps, or consecutive perfect fifths and octaves in contrary motion</p><p>4.

Parallel fifths and octaves</p><p>2. Hidden fifths and octaves</p><p>3. Unequal fifths (diminished fifth to perfect fifth)</p><p>4. Inappropriate leaps</p><p>5. Successive nontriadic leaps</p><p>6.

Judge the bass line as either part of a contrapuntal two-part framework or as a bass line for a four-part harmony exercise, giving the student the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>4. In judging harmonies, always consider the implied bass line suggested by the Roman numerals (and inversions).</p><p>B. Special scores:</p><p>1.
