[{"id":"VH956042-22_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"FRQ Score","stimulusHtml":"<p>I. Always begin with the regular scoring guide. Try an alternate scoring guide only if necessary. (See E below.)</p><p>A. Using the regular scoring guide, award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm. Note that:</p><p>· A “segment” is</p><p>o in simple duple or compound duple meter: any half measure of the original melody , even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse. (In common time or cut time, a segment is any set of two contiguous quarter-note beats; in compound duple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous eighth-note beats.)</p><p>o in simple triple meter: a full measure of the original melody , even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse. (In simple triple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous quarter-note beats.)</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p><p>· Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment may be metrically shifted from its original position.</p><p>· Give no credit for the final note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p><p>B. If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 extra point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1 = 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the extra point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p>C. The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p><p>D. Record any score of 4 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p>E. If after applying A–C the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p>F. If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p>G. Scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</p><p>II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the additional correct segment point.)</p><p>A. Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)</p><p>OR</p><p>B. Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 points)</p><p>III. Rounding fractional scores (applies only to Alternate Scoring Guides):</p><p>A. Half-point totals round down with one exception: A total score of 1½ rounds up to 2.</p><p>B. Quarter points should be rounded to the closest integer.</p><p>For ease of scoring, the Alternate Scoring Guidelines have been accounted for in the point-value options presented.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points","5 points","6 points","7 points","8 points","9 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"maxScores":[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9],"descriptions":["<p>None of the segments are correct in either pitch or rhythm.
