WEIGHTING ERRORS</strong></p><p>The following are <strong>egregious</strong><em> </em>errors.</p><p>(a) Blatant violations of the instructions.</p><p>(b) Parallel octaves or fifths, or diminished fifth to perfect fifth.</p><p>(c) Doubling the leading tone; unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone.</p><p>(d) Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (N.B.: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed).</p><p>(e) Unresolved sevenths or incorrectly resolved sevenths.</p><p>(f) Other note-against-note dissonances (including fourths) that are not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note.</p><p>(g) Poor chord succession (eg., V–IV; V–ii; ii–iii; IV–iii, ii–I; V6–I6; V–vi6; iii–viiº, etc.).</p><p>(h) Root-position leading-tone chord (viiº) followed by anything other than root-position I.</p><p>(i) Poor chord use, such as vi6 (unless as part of parallel six-three sequence or modulation); iii6 (unless as part of parallel six-three sequence).</p><p>(j) Inappropriate leaps (sevenths, augmented fourths, augmented seconds, compound intervals, etc.), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, or leaps of an octave that do not change direction.</p><p>(k) An entire phrase of consecutive thirds or sixths (applicable to phrases 3 and 4).</p><p>The following are <strong>minor</strong> errors (two minor errors = one egregious error).</p><p>(a) Repeated notes and/or Roman numerals and inversions from weak beat to strong beat (unless at start of phrase, or if the second note is a suspension).</p><p>(b) Rhythmically inappropriate cadential six-four chords.</p><p>(c) Approach to octave or fifth in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps, and consecutive perfect fifths and octaves in contrary motion.</p><p>(d) Cross relations.</p><p>(e) Root-position viiº chords that move directly to I.</p><p>(f) More than four consecutive thirds or sixths for half of a phrase.</p><p><strong>E. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p>General considerations.</p><p>(a) Consider each phrase independently; do not judge the connections between each phrase.</p><p>(b) Ignore any inner voices supplied by the students; ignore any/all extraneous labels (nonchord tones, etc.).</p><p>(c) Judge the bass line as either part of a contrapuntal two-part framework or as a bass line for a four-part harmony exercise, giving the student the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>(d) In judging harmonies, always consider the implied bass line suggested by the Roman numerals (and inversions).</p><p>Special scores.</p><p>(a) Award 1 bonus point for a truly musical response or for a response that is solid throughout.</p><p>(b) Award 1 point to a response that otherwise would earn a 0 but that has two or more redeeming qualities.</p><p><strong>0</strong> This score is used for a response that represents an unsuccessful attempt to answer the question (has no redeeming qualities, or only one) or a response that is off-topic or irrelevant.</p>"]}]
