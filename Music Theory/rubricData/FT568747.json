Regular Scoring Guide</strong></p><ol><li><p>Award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm.</p><ul><li><p>A “segment” is any half measure of the original melody, even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse. (In common time or cut time, a segment is any set of two contiguous quarter-note beats; in compound duple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous eighth-note beats.)</p></li><li><p>To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p></li><li><p>Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p></li><li><p>To receive credit, a segment may be metrically shifted from its original position.</p></li><li><p>Give no credit for the final half note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 extra point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1, or 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the extra point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p></li><li><p>Record any score of 4 or higher and ignore the alternate scoring guides.</p></li><li><p>If after applying <strong>I.A.</strong> and <strong>I.B.</strong> the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p></li></ol><p><strong>II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the extra point to the total.)</strong></p><ol><li><p>Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)</p><p>OR</p></li><li><p>Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 points)</p></li></ol><p><strong>III. Rounding Fractional Scores</strong></p><ol><li><p>Half-point totals round down with one exception: A total score of 1½ rounds up to 2.</p></li><li><p>Quarter points should be rounded to the closest integer.</p></li></ol><p><strong>IV. Scores with Additional Meaning</strong></p><blockquote><p>1 This score may also be used for a response that does not have one segment correct in both pitch and rhythm but has two or more redeeming qualities. (Do not award the extra point.)</p><p>0 This score is used for a response that demonstrates an attempt to answer the question but has no redeeming qualities (or only one) or a response that is off-topic or irrelevant.</p><p>— The dash is reserved for blank responses.</p></blockquote><p><strong>V. Scoring Notes</strong></p><ol><li><p>The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p></li><li><p>If you use an alternate scoring guide, do not award the extra point to the total.</p></li><li><p>If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, record the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p></li><li><p>Scores from one guide may not be combined with those from another guide.</p></li></ol>"]}]
