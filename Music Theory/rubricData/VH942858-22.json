(See I.D below.)</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I. Regular Scoring Guide</span></strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> Award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm.</p><p>· A “segment” is any half measure of the original melody (i.e. any set of two contiguous quarter-note beats), even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p><p>· Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment may be metrically shifted from its original position.</p><p>· Give no credit for the final note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p><p>· The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p><p><strong>B.</strong> If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 additional point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 4 + 1 = 5. Exception: Do not award a 5 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award a 4 (i.e., do not award the additional point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Record any score of 2 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p><strong>D.</strong> If after applying A–C the score is less than 2, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p><strong>E.</strong> If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p><strong>F.</strong> For ease of scoring, the Alternate Scoring Guides have been accounted for in the point-value options presented. However, <em>scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</em></p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the additional point to the total.)</span></strong></p><p><strong>A. </strong>Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 2 points)</p><p>OR</p><p><strong>B.</strong> Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 1 point)</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Rounding fractional scores:</p><p>· A total score of ½ rounds up to 1. A total score of 1½ rounds down to 1.</p><p>· Quarter points should be rounded to the closest integer.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/3b6c05bede0619def7a2d8f59046bf82/original.png?Signature=Hmesi%2BxPClK8DjBgKVUxekwibs0%3D&amp;Expires=1656662096&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKURF6ADRX&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEBAaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIHfT4rUhSPv8qvtY3Rg/5l3bgH7L4UIpiJxMhjediH9YAiEAiPDSUbiUJSW0PyJ3NjmtL73Xsf6fNUJxJ6%2BW4GyJoOoq0wQIOBADGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDLqVTtvGTz7ZGKnRaSqwBBeSoLUiz6tJRicvVuCmJfnQMOppoGQO2U9mevXyAprPLL/orGdySGm4wGgRMde4FD/qjIURY0QRDPACB7dKFb0CaDOlwLyurXU8TeKvj2vaG4yPRnjAi9ABIjSFpwsoBywnZ3Ma7YRfclJ/4puzDd7gLcP6SJh28457XPodLRtu6e/YXMZid9B8cMADJQpYdXviedPHIox4/eSEcUZzTE14D7svlX88RWWkTtUxPbduuzNDrcwf3iaRDmjz/vH6b7yr5r%2BkgCtkQVtHHiP4A38A/k9Kin3wpeWKEhCSQtLjDwFGR01K9LkSxkwxTKn47pJTBJ39dfwkgxXeIAXjvC7u1iQYS0s6gWEXQPmFnJyMUQf8DfHkf0fq1yk8IOOQpP6qwd2OyyfOrJjqyUoAouyIxisJlFF4dVgc2QMPztTcEtTC5h5PwJ4eTHy%2BO20dNxL7%2B7oJMpwhhJCA05dDStr2agSLd%2BqouIMvOBTdN14DmRPKYaohkwiDgwNFK%2BOuU4JzOoWtC2/zvqjYPr%2BdTA4DbgjkE0rT1SeFq78OQ11a7rRnzRihYiZIgDNaI/zpfyfAvtbvgoHbASsHmeYVX1CBo%2BI8ljFpE6PZrOwOfTuxcXav7Qas%2BR9PACZAnWCiUW7w%2B5VI7jHJteC4DDDg9AWwxtPtJhwKn4dDj6tisKupYicptKx67YfNdBy%2BoaIgjh2sjGvU81MBo3uNZMCuWkAHR5OFkdzYQdzB/RY9VpsXMMnd%2BJUGOqkB4fRaurGPuVl2D66hPZsy2VrsH8a5wdiUon5cl0QnlYEteBVzjPnliJZCGJfIcYSuyi/07yu6hHM50PAStU7bS3x6xVmZFXhyp%2BhmlwANUD%2BI6vWqtvyS44gErnrOkhfO5mhNlywr8lQvXunRBoTkp6jVnDP68L4Cl9pY8uSCQxUKY9BhxNPaWyFHIAm2kS0bZHDrjfX3InBU396VEojFJihAdcMkIaHFRA%3D%3D\" alt=\"The figure presents two measures in bass clef.
