The third chord has D3 in the bass and B4 in the treble. The analysis below shows: minor 1, dominant major 5 4 2 of minor 4, and minor 4 6. Measure 3 has one chord of half notes and one chord of quarter notes. The first chord in measure 3 has C sharp 3 in the bass clef and B4 in the treble clef. The second chord has C sharp 3 in the bass and G sharp 4 in the treble clef. The analysis shows two options for the chord progression: minor 1 6 4 and major 5 7, or major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 over sharp. The final measure has one dotted half chord with D3 in the bass clef and F sharp 4 in the treble clef. The analysis is major 6. Discussion II.E: The figure shows nine possible pairs of chords with the number of points awarded for each example. The first example has major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3 and the points shown are 1 point for each chord. the next example shows major 5 6 4 going to 5 3 with one point for the first chord and half for the second. The third example shows major 5 6 4 and then blank with 1 point and zero points. The fourth example shows major 5 followed by major 5 7, with half a point and one point awarded. The fifth example shows major 5 6 4 and major 1 with zero points for both. The next example shows major 1 6 4 and major 4 with one point and zero points. The seventh example shows major 5 and major 5, both awarded half a point. The eighth example shows major 5 and a dash, with half a point and half a point. The final example shows major 5 6 4 and major 5 6 4 with one point and half a point.\"></p><p><strong>Chord Symbols (8 points)</strong></p><li><p>Award 1 point for each chord symbol correct in both Roman and Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Award ½ point for each correct Roman numeral that has incorrect or missing Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Accept the correct Roman numeral regardless of its case.</p></li><li><p>Accept any symbol that means “of” or “applied” at Chord Five (e.g., V/iv, [V], V→iv, V of iv, etc.).</p></li><li><p>The cadential six-four may be correctly notated as shown in the key above.
