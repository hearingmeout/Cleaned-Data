The fourth chord in measure 1 has F sharp 3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble. The analysis shows the chords as: major 1, major 5, minor 6, and major 5 6. The notes and analysis of the first chord in measure 1 are surrounded by a dotted line box. The first chord in measure 2 has G3 in the bass clef and B4 in the treble. The second chord in measure 2 has C3 in the bass clef and C5 in the treble clef. The third chord has D3 in the bass and B4 in the treble. The final chord in measure 2 has D3 in the bass clef, and A4 in the treble. The roman numeral analysis shows: major 1, minor 2 6, and then two options for the last two chords: either major 1 6 4 and major 5 7, or major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3. The chord in measure 3 has G2 in the bass and G4 in the treble clef. The analysis below shows major 1. Discussion II.D: The figure shows nine possible pairs of chords with the number of points awarded for each example. The first example has major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 3 and the points shown are 1 point for each chord. the next example shows major 5 6 4 going to 5 3 with one point for the first chord and half for the second. The third example shows major 5 6 4 and then blank with 1 point and zero points. The fourth example shows major 5 followed by major 5 7, with half a point and one point awarded. The fifth example shows major 5 6 4 and major 1 with zero points for both. The next example shows major 1 6 4 and major 4 with one point and zero points. The seventh example shows major 5 and major 5, both awarded half a point. The eighth example shows major 5 and a dash, with half a point and half a point. The final example shows major 5 6 4 and major 5 6 4 with one point and half a point.\"></p><p><strong>Chord Symbols (8 points)</strong></p><li><p>Award 1 point for each chord symbol correct in both Roman and Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Award ½ point for each correct Roman numeral that has incorrect or missing Arabic numerals.</p></li><li><p>Accept the correct Roman numeral regardless of its case.</p></li><li><p>The cadential six-four may be correctly notated as shown in the key above.

The lower staff is in the bass clef and the upper staff is in the treble clef. The key signature has one sharp: F sharp. The time signature is common time. The music is made up of chords of two notes, one in the bass and one in the treble clef. Each measure has four chords of quarter notes apart from the final measure which has a chord of whole notes. There is also space for roman numeral analysis beneath the figured bass for each chord and the key is given as G major. The first chord in measure 1 has G3 in the bass clef and B4 in the treble clef. The second chord in measure 1 has D3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble. The third chord in measure 1 has E3 in the bass clef and G4 in the treble. The fourth chord in measure 1 has F sharp 3 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble. The analysis shows the chords as: major 1, major 5, minor 6, and major 5 6. The notes and analysis of the first chord in measure 1 are surrounded by a dotted line box. The first chord in measure 2 has G3 in the bass clef and B4 in the treble. The second chord in measure 2 has C3 in the bass clef and C5 in the treble clef. The third chord has D3 in the bass and B4 in the treble. The final chord in measure 2 has D3 in the bass clef, and A4 in the treble.
