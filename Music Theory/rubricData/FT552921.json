WEIGHTING ERRORS</strong></p><p>The following are <strong>egregious</strong><em> </em>errors.</p><p>(a) Blatant violations of the instructions.</p><p>(b) Parallel octaves or fifths, or diminished fifth to perfect fifth.</p><p>(c) Doubling the leading tone; unresolved or incorrectly resolved leading tone.</p><p>(d) Tonally inappropriate six-four chord (N.B.: Cadential six-fours, passing six-fours, and pedal six-fours are allowed).</p><p>(e) Unresolved sevenths or incorrectly resolved sevenths.</p><p>(f) Other note-against-note dissonances (including fourths) that are not treated correctly, including Roman numerals (and inversions) that do not match with the given melody note.</p><p>(g) Poor chord succession (eg., V–IV; V–ii; ii–iii; IV–iii, ii–I; V6–I6; V–vi6; iii–viiº, etc.).</p><p>(h) Poor chord use, such as vi6 (unless as part of parallel six-three sequence or modulation); iii6 (unless as part of parallel six-three sequence).</p><p>(i) Inappropriate leaps (sevenths, augmented fourths, augmented seconds, compound intervals, etc.), successive leaps in the same direction that do not outline a triad, or leaps of an octave that do not change direction.</p><p>The following are <strong>minor</strong> errors (two minor errors = one egregious error).</p><p>(a) Repeated notes and/or Roman numerals and inversions from weak beat to strong beat (unless at start of phrase, or if the second note is a suspension).</p><p>(b) Rhythmically inappropriate cadential six-four chords.</p><p>(c) Approach to octave or fifth in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps, and consecutive perfect fifths and octaves in contrary motion.</p><p>(d) Cross relations.</p><p>(e) Root-position viiº chords that move directly to I.</p><p>(f) More than four consecutive thirds or sixths for half of a phrase.</p><p><strong>E. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p>General considerations.</p><p>(a) Consider each phrase independently; do not judge the connections between each phrase.</p><p>(b) Ignore any inner voices supplied by the students; ignore any/all extraneous labels (nonchord tones, etc.).</p><p>(c) Judge the bass line as either part of a contrapuntal two-part framework or as a bass line for a four-part harmony exercise, giving the student the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>(d) In judging harmonies, always consider the implied bass line suggested by the Roman numerals (and inversions).</p><p>(e) In phrase 3, the first four beats comprise the first half of the phrase. In phrase 4, the first five beats comprise the first half of the phrase. In both phrases, the last three notes and their approach comprise the last half of the phrase.</p><p>Special scores.</p><p>(a) Award 1 bonus point for a truly musical response or for a response that is solid throughout.</p><p>(b) Award 1 point to a response that otherwise would earn a 0 but that has two or more redeeming qualities.</p><p><strong>0</strong> This score is used for a response that represents an unsuccessful attempt to answer the question (has no redeeming qualities, or only one) or a response that is off topic or irrelevant.</p>"]}]
