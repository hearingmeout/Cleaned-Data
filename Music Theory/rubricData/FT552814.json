Judging the Cadence</strong></p><ol><li><p>In phrases 3 and 4, award at least 1 point for a phrase if the two chords at its cadence are good in both bass and Roman numeral setting; the bass and Roman numerals must agree in such a case.</p></li><li><p>In general, a phrase that receives maximum points should have a good cadence, with the bass and Roman numerals agreeing with one another at the cadence.</p></li></ol><p><strong>V. Other Guidelines</strong></p><ol><li><p>The following are egregious errors:</p><ol><li><p>Blatant violations of the instructions.</p></li><li><p>Illegal parallel octaves or fifths, or d5→P5, including beat-to-beat parallels (but not parallels that are separated by half of a measure).</p></li><li><p>Inappropriate or poor treatment of the leading tone.</p></li><li><p>Tonally inappropriate six-four chord.</p></li><li><p>Unresolved sevenths or incorrectly resolved sevenths.</p></li><li><p>Other note-against-note dissonances (including fourths) that are not treated correctly, including Roman numerals that do not match with the given melody note and nonsensical ornamental tones.</p></li><li><p>Poor chord succession (e.g., V–IV or ii–iii) or chord use (vi<sup>6</sup>, iii<sup>6</sup>).</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The following are minor errors (in general, two minor errors = one egregious error):</p><ol><li><p>Repeated notes from weak beat to strong beat.</p></li><li><p>Rhythmically inappropriate six-four chord.</p></li><li><p>Approach to octave or fifth in similar motion in which the upper voice leaps.</p></li><li><p>Dissonant or inappropriate melodic intervals (e.g., augmented second or augmented fourth).</p></li><li><p>Cross relations.</p></li><li><p>Root-position viiº that moves directly to I. (Other root-position viiº's are egregious errors.)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Other considerations</p><ol><li><p>Do not judge the connections between each phrase.</p></li><li><p>Do not use fractional points; rely on the phrase descriptors to determine the points to award.</p></li><li><p>Consider each phrase independently.</p></li><li><p>Ignore inner voices.</p></li><li><p>Judge the bass line as either part of a contrapuntal two-part framework or as a bass line for a four-part harmony exercise, giving the student the benefit of the doubt.</p></li><li><p>Except for the considerations outlined in IV above, do not consider the correlation between bass line and Roman numerals.</p></li><li><p>Count at most one egregious error per quarter note and its approach. An upbeat eighth note can cause at most one egregious error.</p></li><li><p>For phrases 3 and 4, the first part of the phrase consists of the first five beats of the phrase; the last part consists of the last three notes.</p></li><li><p>Award at most 2 points to the last two phrases if half notes are used exclusively or almost exclusively.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>VI. Aesthetic Point (1 point)</strong></p><blockquote><p>Award 1 point for truly musical responses or for responses that are entirely solid. Note that a response need not be technically perfect before considering it for the aesthetic point. Therefore, students who earned 6–8 points under sections I through V may be considered for the aesthetic point.</p></blockquote><p><strong>VII. Scores with Additional Meaning</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>1</strong> A response that earns a zero using the scoring guide above but that has some redeeming qualities.</p><p><strong>0</strong> A response that demonstrates an attempt to answer the question but that has no redeeming qualities (or only one).</p></blockquote>"]}]
