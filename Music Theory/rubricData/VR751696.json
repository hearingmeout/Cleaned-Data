Using the regular scoring guide, award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm. Note that:</p><ul><li><p>A “segment” is <em>any</em> half measure of the original melody in 4/4 or 6/8 or full measure of the original melody in 2/4, 3/4, or 3/8, even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse.</p></li><li><p>To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p></li><li><p>Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p></li><li><p>To receive credit, a segment <em>may</em> be metrically shifted up to one segment before or after its original position.</p></li><li><p>Give no credit for the final note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p></li><li><p>The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p></li></ul><p><strong>B</strong>. If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 additional point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1 = 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the additional point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p><strong>C</strong>. Record any score of 4 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p><strong>D</strong>. If after applying A–C the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p><strong>E</strong>. If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p><strong>F</strong>. Scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</p><p></p><p><strong>II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the additional point.)</strong></p><p><strong>A. </strong>Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)</p><p>OR</p><p><strong>B.</strong> Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 point)</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Rounding fractional scores:</p><ul><li><p>Total scores of ½ and 1½ round up to the closest integer. A total score of 2½ and 3½ round down to the closest integer.</p></li><li><p>¼ and ¾ points should be rounded to the closest integer</p></li></ul><p>For ease of scoring, the Alternate Scoring Guidelines have been accounted for in the point-value options presented.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.testing.academicmerit.com/d80da114520c885f047b733036ca87bc/original.png?Signature=Lt8YkftD7QyPCymOt3sIDPhdsn8%3D&amp;Expires=1698067464&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAXUCCNI2WW3MNENYN&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEP3//////////wEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIDeEyR61TACJ7aNQz%2B7Wvuo/0YXpRk/nuEyBpBShEEZDAiAhP7itKlbYa0NtBDqaO8I5W7a6jNW62LlvnAWXAYiAlSqyBQgmEAAaDDUyNDEyNTI5MjIwNSIMS1w9%2BTgh8A7Zfj%2BFKo8Fj1YsosVjvawUasH6tmJQYaMMY3m2CCZcjPXxUj5s8V9sHM4qY4AMzSdMY8dYzPGJnJxExvfjP5GfLfnMhHxkehs4pUQSQWLvS3FVf4U0eC3Ft6FPOKLOd/zg9YfCXqNwv7zXp8c302XBEQ6AhGi2m50noBuo/g68dUixY3E3Eyh/ywwVX0kAiUo2B2quZCAEEBfMRL0DCyyNP%2B3NyD0xdvh5ECfDf/Ed9J4I0TSE9wx3L3OAcUp3abIv6ywt5g3HRCJ3DiZGzfkV25Ru9RrmzP24xg/73lXeHWmz4HwXJSFe6RU9iP1m9S3pfH4npl8i2qFQgAgmRrD/YDI6A28kbS3kqoV8p9ZMtuFhZrCDuocg2kHpQkv%2BA23BKoeaqCLdoe/NCDBtN61QFOVsdpqAoJY5g37pf72ufifBA2LruP62kP65DS/tkLqv8GhHI5MgStJYN25Wazo928H6kf0Pql2NJN7skF5uK%2B8GFOfTJSfw/X43w%2BwxKAmZTtwXKG4nsowl2fu9giOX6Q/HUid4MpWgsTkqKrJPVkhY6Qq/ekt0ca4PN8kXiZvOTMG7Z/3LpouGZFg3gP6ODIQlmhZ4U/%2BPrqiLhnZAGeLa8ZFW5zxZyVK4BiiY5kUYlZnM7wuMiIS5D4ED/ZNB1sn%2BOfCjvKsyijgvIZzFBXb2o5cOitwCkUf9kYKf1j3naSxGe8nQW5jIY6XLSaUWPyehm4FTJUQeQ8AVJUZ7AXfVsMw6movBV7sVEafkSzi9E6tG/Wn3ip3o2ZCXVQx%2BeoWA/0u5onXeHjmcF9ZvEEmQCre%2BgEQsUw6lQ7/e9tBsdAjVZ5aXH6FRHgSgxIJ8W9F9kUZaNVOyH%2BGuD8NqETXdju2XuDC87depBjqyAZVzdyyECfVvVmOyPiT%2BPaTE%2BwiN1qxGoeifZ83jrtPFUb0wfQJ1fNIYNw2WrM2GxQv%2B0jEkIU5ND/XBvYaRgcFun5p44r6c2k0b3brPOnEs%2ByRssJwsH0w23zxkcG1fnXEfhiHS7IVAgHWcEvRPrWHyOR26UPJjsBSZQ%2BijWDKsnlMX8u97ZP3ll%2BTxbTbTkdqt/V16N%2Bg3B72lrqtZC5uiH7khl0muIRbeO3buShXKnY4%3D\" alt=\"The figure presents four measures of music in treble clef.
