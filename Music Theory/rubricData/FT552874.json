There is a dotted line box around the notes and analysis of the first chord in measure 1. The first chord in measure 2 has D3 in the bass clef and D5 in the treble clef. The second chord has D sharp 3 in the bass and B4 in the treble clef. The third chord has E3 in the bass and C5 in the treble. The fourth chord has E3 in the bass and B4 in the treble The analysis below shows: minor 4, dominant major 5 6 5 of major 5, then two options for chords 3 and 4: either minor 1 6 4 and major 5 7, or major 5 8 6 4 going to 7 5 over sharp. The final chord has A2 in the bass clef and A4 in the treble clef.
