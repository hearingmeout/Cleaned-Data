(See I.D below.)</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I. Regular Scoring Guide</span></strong></p><p><strong>A. </strong>Award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm.</p><p>· A “segment” is any full measure of the original melody (i.e. any set of three contiguous quarter-note beats), even if occurring over a bar line or beginning on a metrically weak pulse.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.</p><p>· Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.</p><p>· To receive credit, a segment may be metrically shifted from its original position.</p><p>· Give no credit for the final note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.</p><p>· The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.</p><p><strong>B.</strong> If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 additional point to the total. For example, a response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1 = 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the additional point) to an otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Record any score of 4 or higher and disregard the alternate scoring guides.</p><p><strong>D.</strong> If after applying A–C the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.</p><p><strong>E.</strong> If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.</p><p><strong>F.</strong> For ease of scoring, the Alternate Scoring Guides have been accounted for in the point-value options presented. However, <em>scores from the regular scoring guide may not be combined with those from an alternate scoring guide and vice versa.</em></p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the additional point to the total.)</span></strong></p><p><strong>A. </strong>Award ½ point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)</p><p>OR</p><p><strong>B.</strong> Award ¼ point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 point)</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Rounding fractional scores:</p><p>· Total scores of ½ and 1½ round up to the closest integer. A total score of 2½ and 3½ round down to the closest integer.</p><p>· Quarter points should be rounded to the closest integer.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/04d042bb47803bcd7f08ac8f15891ab5/original.png?Signature=6GksagA94ycIoa%2BAXLyDUwQfnLo%3D&amp;Expires=1656662159&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZK3NLAVRWM&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEBAaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD1k2HLIItjZRBTd7/wkMQBg%2Bb7KnH93F21h7OLghmNsAIhAM8O9BDEl8v%2BMZHGX7Av6gig36%2B0HYQNkh8ehhQ7scjEKtIECDgQAxoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1IgxSGtODUKbh%2BwGQAZcqrwRK6kKjnlBpiFeDR2l1u2viOHNZ4PtLt2AIsdgyJWcX1gynpV7nHzTvdBLaVBUOqsHtvrnTSk7givuO0jun%2Bz81PJGqtdQynywM6GAWQh20DOkc3uXHLgpSrFchjeOd1uosSW8jYgjDkZ%2BjmD4dizRmFqVi8WXhD2CoXLS%2B5Sd4DeNinjb0s9kDiTzkJ0h1GrCQS/pYEw4vRFAvCAvMWWoAErYzTlqz0EWDi3Ga1XE9gkU6XpuvNOIqvgTkIrAMspUS/1uQb06hS%2B2IZZIXXSJyXwHAQ%2BRE4GYt12DdiapXDwhOWg5xH7VdHuOBZrp8fnH7lYAqdZnnTfaCLeOeHUhY7kCzt0Y/ie7O2cjpmpsi2KGRnZbcvoM8FmBy94B9Al9d4IRjxDA83caKyF6Fj6eGD%2BIJbhxQBTBKeGKeZmHfGcpVKFI1gFtd4AHofgh8mtJAOvgTEg93cR6/Nn9ZeaEdq6yCnlsni74u%2BalxmGxH/oYFSo2JO9w%2BGkR7KkcV/A4JaMQbB0JhgrXUAMVpQ6JlxGWYmp4Vykf78La85S/r1j9zVv4AVGk4YfJrQGLH3hAlSX5pV7yPE2G%2B7zTquDekRVZK7HVFnuSUyM%2BaqdsKY/2CgsSmmAlzhB4Y1xn/rkoBPaa%2B1dMC9vR8foDeA%2Bq2vOgfMlmx80Wvf8qODfX74pjcXKxDknUH4CBbP3RjwOV1Prh%2B6MomQEUrAwa%2BqS8wHv1YweGMpn82mJLuIz0OMLva%2BJUGOqgB2GAnhtgp0lDmbzF8%2B65I7pzRUks7mFSpW0ynh%2BH1UOzKkAJxXkVAqGN7JZxrVsWoGIpz3JKrHSbG71fp3URter4KrhQGGbpbWxD5e27iEzWQ/vLbRTbVxyKzDZNAkpLVzJNOeusVUeUIbTW3LpC%2BGvaL7QKeOL246b3kl8RYRSJU6eRaE4jRBaEVRv86wXgQKwfkfS%2BtVh/W6JIKCRyWRjWsoypJ3xqf\" alt=\"The figure presents eight measures of music in bass clef.
