The lower staff is in the bass clef and the upper staff is in the treble clef. The key signature has two sharps: F sharp and C sharp. The time signature is common time. The score consists of chords of four notes with figured bass beneath. There is roman numeral analysis beneath the figured bass and the key is given as b minor. There are four chords of quarter notes in measure 1 and two quarter note chords and a half note chord in measure 2. The first chord in measure 1 has B2, D4 in the bass clef and F sharp 4, B4 in the treble clef. There is a vertical line separating the notes of the first chord from the rest of the measure. The second chord in measure 1 has E3, E4 in the bass clef and G4, B4 in the treble clef. The third chord has E3, C sharp 4 in the bass clef and F sharp 4, A sharp 4 in the treble clef. The fourth chord has D3, B3 in the bass clef and F sharp 4, B4 in the treble clef. The figured bass below measure 1 shows: blank, blank, 4 with slash 2, and 6. The analysis shows: minor 1, minor 4, major 5, and minor 1. The first chord in measure 2 has E3, B3 in the bass clef and G4, C sharp 5 in the treble clef. The second chord in measure 2 has F sharp 3, A sharp 3 in the bass clef and F sharp 4, C sharp 5 in the treble clef. The final chord has G3, B3 in the bass clef and D4, B4 in the treble clef. The figured bass below measure 2 shows: 6 5, sharp, and then blank. The analysis shows: minor 2 half diminished, major 5, and major 6.\"></p><p><strong>I.
