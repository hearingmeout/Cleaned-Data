You may play the starting pitch for the melody at the beginning of the practice period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">Your performance:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:2\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">1. You may sing note names (C-D-E), syllable names (do-re-mi), scale-degree numbers (1-2-3), or a neutral syllable (for example, ta-ta-ta).</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">2. Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">3. You should use some of the practice time to perform out loud. You may write on the music if you wish.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">4. You may not use any device (for example, a metronome or a musical instrument) to assist you in your practice or performance.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">5. You will be evaluated on rhythmic accuracy, pitch accuracy (relative to tonic), and continuity (maintaining a steady tempo). You may start over, if you need to, but there will be a deduction from your score. You will not be evaluated on the quality of your singing voice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">Look over the melody, practice the melody, and then perform the melody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">Suggested time: Play the starting pitch for the melody and then use 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice and up to 30 seconds to perform the melody.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\"><span class=\"sound_script\"><span class=\"learnosity-feature\" data-player=\"bar\" data-src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH955815.a02.mp3\" data-type=\"audioplayer\"></span></span></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Prompt 1</p>\n<img alt=\"Four measure melody in bass clef.
