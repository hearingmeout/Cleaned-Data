Continue logically from the spacing of the first chord. In the space below each chord, supply the Roman numeral that appropriately indicates harmonic function.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure presents a two measure score. There is one staff in the treble clef and one in the bass clef. The key signature has four flats: B flat, E flat, A flat, and D flat. The time signature is common time. The first chord is shown and the remaining bass line is shown in the bass clef. There are no further notes in the treble clef. Below the notes in the bass clef are figured bass numbers to indicate the chord inversions. There is also space below the staff for analysis with one space for each bass note. The beginning of the analysis shows the key with a lower case f (i.e. f minor). The first chord consists of quarter notes with F3 and C4 in the bass clef and with F4 and A flat 4 in the treble clef. The remaining notes in the bass clef in measure 1 are quarter notes of A flat 2, B flat 2 and C3. The spaces below the staff for measure 1 are marked: blank for the first chord, 6 for the second chord, 6 for the third chord, and a natural sign for the fourth. The rhythm in measure 2 is: quarter, quarter, and half. The pitches in the bass line in measure 2 are: D flat 3, B flat 2, and C3. The spaces below the staff for measure 2 are marked: blank for the first and second chords, and a 4 to natural for the final chord. Question 6: The figure presents a two measure score on the grand staff. The lower staff has a bass clef and the upper staff has a treble clef. The key signature has four sharps: F sharp, C sharp, G sharp, and D sharp. The time signature is common time. Only the first chord in the first measure is given. The chord consists of four quarter notes: E3 and B3 in the bass clef, and E4 and G sharp 4 in the treble clef. Roman numeral analysis below the staff indicates the chord progression. The key is E major. The analysis indicates four chords in measure 1: a major 1 triad in the root position, a secondary dominant major 5 4 2 of major 4, a major 4 6, and a minor 2 6 5. There are three chords in the analysis for measure 2, with two different sets of options for the first two chords. The first two chords can be major 1 6 4 and major 5 7, or they can be played as a major 5 8 6 4 suspension to major 5 7 5 3. Finally, there is a major 1 triad in root position.\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d2690e37b0d3dd0c394f7388bb210b94/original.png\" width=\"550\" /></p>\n\n<p><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Enter any notes as you prepare your response.</p>\n"},{"id":"FT544942","type":"fileupload","stimulusHtml":"<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\nUpload your final response."}]
