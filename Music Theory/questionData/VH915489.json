The key signature has six flats and the time signature is two-four. \n-\tThe lower treble clef – the left hand – in measure 81 consists of four groups of sixteenth-note triplets. The first triplet is pitches B-flat 3, G-flat 4, and D-flat 5. The second triplet is D-flat 4, B-flat 4, and G-flat 5. The third triplet is G-flat 4, B-flat 4, and G-flat 5. The final triplet is D-flat 4, B-flat 4, and G-flat 5. Measure 82 repeats this pattern.\n-\tThere are two circled harmonic intervals in the upper treble clef – the right hand – in measure 82. The first interval is G-flat 5 and B-flat 5. The second interval is E-flat 5 and G-flat 5.\n\n\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH915487.g05.png\" width=\"650\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">both minor thirds</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">both major thirds</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">a minor third followed by a major third</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">a major third followed by a minor third</p>"],"answer":3}]
