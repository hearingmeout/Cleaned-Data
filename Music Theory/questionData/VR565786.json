You will hear the starting pitch for each melody at the beginning of the practice period. After the end of the practice period, you will have 30 seconds to perform the melody. A recorded announcement will alert you to the end of each practice and performance period. Directions on the recording will assist you in operating the recorder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"ExtendedTextStemParagraph\" style=\"margin-bottom:14px\"><br />\n<em>Your performance:</em><br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You may sing note names (C-D-E), syllable names (do-re-mi), scale-degree numbers (1-2-3), or a neutral syllable (for example, ta-ta-ta).<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You should use some of the practice time to perform out loud. You may write on the music if you wish.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You may not use any device (for example, a metronome or musical instrument) to assist you in your practice or performance.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You will be evaluated on rhythmic accuracy, pitch accuracy (relative to tonic), and continuity (maintaining a steady tempo). You may start over if you need to, but there will be a deduction&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from your score. You will not be evaluated on the quality of your singing voice.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Look over the melody and begin practicing. You have 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice. This is the starting pitch of the printed melody. <span class=\"inline_image\"><img alt=\"The pictogram displaying two eighth notes indicates when music will be played.\" height=\"42\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/MusicBtn.jpg.jpg\" width=\"50\" /></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\"><span class=\"learnosity-feature\" data-player=\"bar\" data-simplefeature_id=\"_a5deb02a6a55474c683f70aa1b3d88b3\" data-src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/8274f51f-7e74-407e-92de-8cda41ca5c43.mp3\" data-type=\"audioplayer\"></span></p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure shows four measures of music in treble clef.
