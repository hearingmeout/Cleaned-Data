Below the bass line, write the Roman and Arabic numerals that indicate the harmonies and inversions implied by the soprano and bass. Observe the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\">A. Keep the portion you compose consistent with the first phrase.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:1\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">1.

Give melodic interest to the bass line by balancing upward and downward motion and by balancing melodic steps and leaps. (Embellishing tones are not required. If you choose to use them, the only acceptable embellishing tones are unaccented passing tones, unaccented neighbor tones, and unaccented chordal skips.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"unordered_list style:1\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">3.

The key signature is B-flat major and the time signature is common time. There are four phrases of music, and the bass line is blank for the end of phrase three and all of phrase four. Phrase three begins on the pickup to measure 5 with a five six chord. The harmonies of measure 5 are one, one, five, and one. The notes of the last one chord are quarter notes B-flat 2 in the bass, and F4 in the melody. The “start here” label is at the downbeat of measure 6. The remaining melody of phrase three is quarter notes E4, E-natural4, and F4. The melody of phrase four begins with a quarter note pickup, F4, at the end of measure 6. The melody in measure 7 is quarter notes B-flat4, D5, C5, and E-flat5. The end of phrase four in measure eight is quarter notes D5 and C5, and half note B-flat4.\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR020238.g01.png\" width=\"565\" /></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR020238_rubric"},{"id":"VR020238-22","type":"fileupload","rubricRef":"VR020238_rubric"}]
