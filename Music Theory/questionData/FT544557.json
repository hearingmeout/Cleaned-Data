The key signature has three sharps and the time signature is three-four. Measures 1 through 4 is a piano introduction. A melodic motive is introduced in the treble clef in measure 1: eighth G-sharp4, eighth A4, quarter B4, eighth A4, eighth G-sharp4. This motive is repeated in the bass clef an octave lower in measure 2. It appears again, transposed down a step, in measure 3: eighth F-sharp3, eighth G-sharp3, quarter A3, eighth G-sharp3, eighth F-sharp3. In measures 2 and 3 in the treble clef, there are a series of chords. The rhythm in measure 2 is quarter note half note, with an accent on the half note. The rhythm in measure 3 is quarter note, dotted quarter, and eighth. The boxed chord on the downbeat of measure 2 includes the pitches G-sharp3, F-sharp4, B4, and D5. In measures 5 through 8, the melody appears in the violin part while the piano plays the accompaniment. The violin melody builds on the melodic motive presented in measure 1. The piano plays the repeated interval F-sharp2 and C-sharp3 in measures 5 through 7 and the interval F-sharp2 and D3 in measure 8. The cadence in measures 11 and 12 moves from the harmony C-sharp, E-sharp, and B in measure 11, to the harmony F-sharp, A, and C-sharp in measure 12. The cadence in measures 19 and 20 moves from the harmony E, G-sharp, and D-natural in measure 19, to A, C-sharp, and E in measure 20. In measures 13 through 16, the piano repeats the violin melody from measures 5 through 8. At the same time, the violin plays a melody that begins on C-sharp4, ascends with steps and leaps to F-sharp5, and then ascends again with steps and leaps to A6.\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/8d5736db0b1ba360510dcb4e3fda4274/original.png\" width=\"650\">"}],"choicesHtml":["<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 11–12</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 19–20</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A major: deceptive</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A major: authentic</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 11–12</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 19–20</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">f<em>#</em>-minor: deceptive</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">f# minor: authentic</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 11–12</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 19–20</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">f# minor: authentic</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A major: authentic</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n","<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 11–12</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\"><strong>Measures 19–20</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">f# minor: authentic</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"text-center\">A major: half</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n"],"answer":1}]
