You will hear the starting pitch for each melody at the beginning of the practice period. After the end of the practice period, you will have 30 seconds to perform the melody. A recorded announcement will alert you to the end of each practice and performance period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"><em>Your performance</em>:</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a)</strong> You may sing note names (C-D-E), syllable names (do-re-mi), scale-degree numbers (1-2-3), or a neutral syllable (for example, ta-ta-ta).</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b)</strong> Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c)</strong> You should use some of the practice time to perform out loud.
