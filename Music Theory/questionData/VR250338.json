You will hear the starting pitch for the melody at the beginning of the 1 minute and 15 second practice period. After the end of the practice period, you will have 30 seconds to perform the melody. A recorded announcement will alert you to the end of each practice and performance period. Directions on the recording will assist you in operating the recorder.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Your performance:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">a) You may sing note names (<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">c-d-e</span>), syllable names (<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">do-re-mi</span>), scale-degree numbers (<span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">1-2-3</span>), or a neutral syllable (for example, <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">ta-ta-ta</span>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">b) Even though you will hear the starting pitch of the printed melody, you may transpose the melody to a key that is comfortable.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">c) You should use some of the warm-up and practice time to perform out loud. You may write on the music if you wish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">d) You may <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">not</span> use any device (for example, a metronome or a musical instrument) to assist you in your practice or performance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">e) You will be evaluated on pitch accuracy (relative to tonic), rhythm, and continuity (maintaining a steady tempo). You may start over if you need to, but there will be a deduction from your score. You will <span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">not</span> be evaluated on the quality of your singing voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Look over the melody and begin practicing. You have 1 minute and 15 seconds to practice. This is the starting pitch of the printed melody.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents four measures of musical notation on a single staff.
