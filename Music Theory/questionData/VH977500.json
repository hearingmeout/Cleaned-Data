The key signature has one sharp and the time signature is three-four. The last beat of measure seven contains the quarter notes D2, C4, and F-sharp 4, and the eighth notes A4 and G4. The eighth note G4 is circled. The boxed portion of the score includes the last beat of measure fifteen and the first two beats of measure sixteen. The last beat of measure fifteen contains the pitches D3, A3, D4, and F4. Halfway through the beat the D4 moves down to C4. On the downbeat of measure sixteen, the pitches are G3, C4, D4, and G4. On beat two, the note D2 is added and the C4 moves down to B3. In measures 9 through 11, the harmonies are G major, D major, E minor, and A major. The melody is all eighth-notes and skips between members of each chord with some leaps filled in by stepwise passing motion. In measures 25 through 27, the time signature of the treble clef changes to nine-eight, while the time signature of the bass clef stays in three-four. The harmonies are G major, D major, E minor, and A major. The melody is all eighth notes and has a different contour and more passing tones than the melody from measures 9 through 11.\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH977486.g01.png\" width=\"750\" /></div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Anticipation</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Suspension</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Passing tone</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Neighbor tone</p>"],"answer":1}]
