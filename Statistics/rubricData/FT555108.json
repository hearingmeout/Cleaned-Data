The coin can be tossed a second time to determine which arm is put into the bin first. A potential disadvantage of this experiment is that the mosquitoes that are most aggressive and most resistant to the compounds will be more likely to bite the first arm inserted into a bin and less likely to bite the second arm. Randomizing the order in which the arms are inserted into the bin controls potential bias of this order effect, but the variability of the observed differences may be substantially larger than for the two other matched-pairs designs that were previously described, and this would make the comparison of the effects of the compounds less precise.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is essentially correct (E) if the matched-pairs design is chosen over a CRD based on rationale that the blocking factor will reduce person-to-person variability in susceptibility to mosquito bites.</p><p>Part (c) is partially correct (P) if the student:</p><ul><li><p>Chooses the CRD over an incorrect matched-pairs design with appropriate rationale; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses a matched-pairs design over a CRD, with weak rationale.</p></li></ul><p>Part (c) is incorrect (I) if the student:</p><ul><li><p>Makes a choice with no justification or a severely flawed argument; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the matched-pairs design because the sample size is larger; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the CRD with the justification that a CRD is always better than a matched-pairs design; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the matched-pairs design with the justification that a matched-pairs design is always better than a CRD.</p></li></ul><p>Each essentially correct (E) response counts as 1 point, each partially correct (P) response counts as ½ point.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><p>Note: If a response is in between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to determine whether to score up or down depending on the strength of the response and communication.</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4],"maxScores":[4,4,4,4,4],"descriptions":["<p><strong>Student response earns 0 of the following 4 points</strong></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><strong>Part (a):</strong></p><p>Each of the 100 selected people will be assigned a unique random number using a random number generator.

This can be done by using a random number generator to assign each participant a unique random number and sorting the list of participants with respect to those numbers. Bins 1 and 2 are assigned to the first participant on the list, bins 3 and 4 are assigned to the second participant on the list, and so on. For each subject, a coin is tossed to determine which bin is assigned to which arm. Then, the experiment proceeds as described above.

Randomizing the order in which the arms are inserted into the bin controls potential bias of this order effect, but the variability of the observed differences may be substantially larger than for the two other matched-pairs designs that were previously described, and this would make the comparison of the effects of the compounds less precise.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is essentially correct (E) if the matched-pairs design is chosen over a CRD based on rationale that the blocking factor will reduce person-to-person variability in susceptibility to mosquito bites.</p><p>Part (c) is partially correct (P) if the student:</p><ul><li><p>Chooses the CRD over an incorrect matched-pairs design with appropriate rationale; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses a matched-pairs design over a CRD, with weak rationale.</p></li></ul><p>Part (c) is incorrect (I) if the student:</p><ul><li><p>Makes a choice with no justification or a severely flawed argument; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the matched-pairs design because the sample size is larger; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the CRD with the justification that a CRD is always better than a matched-pairs design; OR</p></li><li><p>Chooses the matched-pairs design with the justification that a matched-pairs design is always better than a CRD.</p></li></ul><p>Each essentially correct (E) response counts as 1 point, each partially correct (P) response counts as ½ point.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><p>Note: If a response is in between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to determine whether to score up or down depending on the strength of the response and communication.</p>","<p><strong>Student response earns 3 of the following 4 points</strong></p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><strong>Part (a):</strong></p><p>Each of the 100 selected people will be assigned a unique random number using a random number generator.
