The sampling distribution of the total number of absences for the 3 days is approximately normal, with mean 3(120) = 360 absences and standard deviation 3(6.026) ≈ 18.187 absences. The <em>z</em>-score for a total of 3(140) = 420 absences is: (420-360)/18.187 ≈ 3.30.

The table of standard normal probabilities or a calculator reveals that the</p><p>probability that 140 or fewer students are absent is 0.9713. So the probability that more than 140 students are absent (and that the school will lose some state funding) is 1 – 0.9713 = 0.0287.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong><br>High School A would be less likely to lose state funding. With a random sample of 3 days, the<br>distribution of the sample mean number of students absent would have less variability than that of a single day. With less variability, the distribution of the sample mean would concentrate more narrowly around the mean of 120 students, resulting in a smaller probability that the mean number of students absent would exceed 140.</p><p>In particular, the standard deviation of the sample mean number of absences, x̄, is σ/√n = 10.5/√3 = 6.062. So the <em>z</em>-score for a sample mean of 140 is (140 - 120) / 6.062 ≈ 3.30. The probability that High School A loses funding using the suggested plan would be 1 – 0.9995 = 0.0005, as determined from the table of standard normal probabilities or from a calculator, which is less than a probability of 0.0287 obtained for the plan described in part (a).</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>For any one typical school week, the probability is 2/5 = 0.4 that the day selected is not Tuesday, not Wednesday, or not Thursday.
