Within block 1, each bird of a particular species (let’s say the blackbirds) will be tagged with a unique random number using a random number generator on a calculator, statistical software, or a random number table. The random numbers will be sorted from lowest to highest. The birds with the lowest 50 numbers in the ordered list will receive treatment 1 (red background with narrow blue stripes). The birds with the highest 50 numbers will receive treatment 2 (blue background with narrow red stripes).
