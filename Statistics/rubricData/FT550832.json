Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Section 1 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following components:</p><ol><li><p>Identifies correct parameters;</p></li><li><p>Includes both hypotheses with labels and stating the correct relationships between the parameters;</p></li><li><p>Correctly calculates or states the value of the test statistic, and;</p></li><li><p>Provides a correct <em>p</em>-value.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only two or three of the components necessary for E.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response includes at most one of the components necessary for E.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>For step 1, either defining the parameter symbols in context, or simply using common parameter notation, such as <em>p</em><sub>A</sub> and <em>p</em><sub>B</sub> , is sufficient. However, if parameter symbols are defined they must be done correctly, and must implicitly or explicitly refer to the population and not the samples.</p></li><li><p>For step 3, the <em>p-</em>value is considered correct if it is consistent with the alternative hypothesis stated in the response and the calculated test statistic, even if those are incorrect.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Section 2 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly includes the following three components:</p><ol><li><p>Identifies the correct test procedure (by name or by formula);</p></li><li><p>Notes the use of a random sample, and;</p></li><li><p>Checks for approximate normality by citing that all four counts are larger than some standard criterion such as 5 or 10, or by stating that all four counts are clearly greater than standard criteria.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly includes only two of the three components required for E.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response correctly includes one or none of the three components required for E.</p><p><em>Note: </em>Correctly using the combined proportion is sufficient for checking approximate normality.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Section 3 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly provides a conclusion in context and in terms of the alternative hypothesis AND correctly provides a justification based on linkage between the <em>p</em>-value and the conclusion. (No value of alpha was provided, so it is not necessary to state a specific alpha for the linkage.)</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides a correct decision to reject H<sub>0</sub> but with an incorrect conclusion, AND with either correct linkage, or context, or both;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response provides a correct conclusion in terms of the alternative hypothesis but with only correct linkage or only context, but not both.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>If the conclusion is consistent with an incorrect <em>p</em>-value from step 3, and also in context with justification based on linkage to the <em>p</em>-value, then section 3 is scored as E, unless the conclusion is stated as <em>accepting </em>the null hypothesis.</p></li><li><p>If an appropriate value for 𝛼 and the <em>p</em>-value are stated together, linkage is implied.</p></li><li><p>If an interpretation of the <em>p</em>-value is included, it must be correct in order to receive credit for the conclusion.</p></li><li><p><em>For sections 1 to 3: </em>If the response includes a correct chi-squared test for homogeneity of proportions, then the response should be scored no higher than 3. If the chi-squared test <em>p</em>-value is halved to reflect the one-sided alternative hypothesis, the response should still be scored no higher than 3.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Section 4 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response states that the newspaper conclusion was not appropriate, and provides justification based on a specific characteristic of the study, such as being an observational study, not using random assignment, not being an experiment, or not <em>controlling </em>for confounding variables.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response states that the newspaper conclusion was not appropriate, and gives a reasonable but generic justification such as association doesn’t imply causation or a vague reference to the existence of confounding variables.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p>Each essentially correct (E) section counts as 1 point, and a partially correct (P) section counts as ½ point. If a response is between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to decide whether to score up or down, depending on the strength of the response and communication.</p><blockquote><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p></blockquote>"]}]
