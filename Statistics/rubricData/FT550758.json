More specific goals were to assess students’ ability to (1) state appropriate hypotheses; (2) identify the appropriate statistical test procedure and check appropriate conditions for inference; (3) calculate the appropriate test statistic and <em>p</em>-value; and (4) draw an appropriate conclusion, with justification, in the context of the study.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p>Step 1: States a correct pair of hypotheses.</p><blockquote><p>μn represents the mean patient response (myocardial salvage index) to the new treatment.</p><p>μs represents the mean patient response (myocardial salvage index) to the standard care treatment.</p><p>μn - μs represents the difference in mean response for the two treatments. We want to test whether the data provide convincing evidence that the new treatment produces a higher mean myocardial salvage index than the standard care, so the hypotheses to be tested are:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>H0: μn = μs vs Ha: μn &gt; μs , or H0: μn - μs = 0 vs Ha: μn - μs &gt; 0</p></blockquote><p>Step 2: Identifies a correct test procedure (by name or by formula) and checks appropriate conditions.</p><blockquote><p>Provided the conditions are satisfied, the appropriate procedure is a two-sample t-test.</p><p>Because this data is from an experiment, the first condition is random assignment to treatment groups. We are told that the 112 patients in the study were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, so this condition is satisfied.</p><p>The second condition is that the populations of myocardial salvage index values follow normal distributions or the sample sizes are large. We are not given enough information to assess whether the myocardial salvage index values follow normal distributions, but both sample sizes nn= 56 and ns = 56 are large enough (n &gt; 30) for the two-sample t-test to be valid.</p><p>Step 3: Correct mechanics, including the value of the test statistic value and p-value (or rejection region).</p><p>The test statistic is:</p><p><math aria-label=\"t equals start fraction, x bar subscript n minus x bar subscript s, over start square root of, start fraction, s squared subscript n over n subscript n, end fraction, plus start fraction, s squared subscript s, over n subscript s, end fraction, end square root, end fraction, equals start fraction, 0.69 minus 0.57 over start square root of, start fraction, 0.27 squared over 56, end fraction, plus start fraction, 0.26 squared over 56, end fraction, end square root, end fraction, approximately equals 2.40.\">\n <mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <msub>\n    <mrow>\n     <mover accent=\"true\">\n      <mi>x</mi>\n      <mo stretchy=\"true\">¯</mo>\n     </mover>\n     </mrow>\n    <mi>n</mi>\n   </msub>\n   <mo>−</mo><msub>\n    <mrow>\n     <mover accent=\"true\">\n      <mi>x</mi>\n      <mo stretchy=\"true\">¯</mo>\n     </mover>\n     </mrow>\n    <mi>s</mi>\n   </msub>\n   </mrow>\n  <mrow>\n   <msqrt>\n    <mrow>\n     <mfrac bevelled=\"true\">\n      <mrow>\n       <msubsup>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n       </msubsup>\n       </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n       <msub>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n       </msub>\n       </mrow>\n     </mfrac>\n     <mo>+</mo><mfrac bevelled=\"true\">\n      <mrow>\n       <msubsup>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n       </msubsup>\n       </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n       <msub>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n       </msub>\n       </mrow>\n     </mfrac>\n     </mrow>\n   </msqrt>\n   </mrow>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>=</mo><mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <mn>0.69</mn><mo>−</mo><mn>0.57</mn></mrow>\n  <mrow>\n   <msqrt>\n    <mrow>\n     <mfrac bevelled=\"true\">\n      <mrow>\n       <msubsup>\n        <mrow>\n         <mn>0.27</mn></mrow>\n        <mrow></mrow>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n       </msubsup>\n       </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n       <mn>56</mn></mrow>\n     </mfrac>\n     <mo>+</mo><mfrac bevelled=\"true\">\n      <mrow>\n       <msubsup>\n        <mrow>\n         <mn>0.26</mn></mrow>\n        <mrow></mrow>\n        <mn>2</mn>\n       </msubsup>\n       </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n       <mn>56</mn></mrow>\n     </mfrac>\n     </mrow>\n   </msqrt>\n   </mrow>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>≈</mo><mn>2.40</mn>\n</math></p><p>The p-value = 0.009, based on 109 degrees of freedom.</p><p>(The p-value = 0.0099, based on conservative df = smaller sample size – 1 = 55).</p></blockquote><p>Step 4: States a correct conclusion in the context of the study, using the result of the statistical test.</p><blockquote><p>Because this p-value is small, smaller than any common significance level such as a = 0.05 or a = 0.01, we reject H0 and conclude that the data provide convincing evidence that the new treatment produces a higher mean myocardial salvage index than the standard care.
