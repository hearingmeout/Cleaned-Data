Since this was an observational study, a cause-and-effect conclusion is not justified. Sedentary women could differ from walkers with respect to other factors that affect BMD. For example, walkers may be more likely to avoid smoking and may be more careful about including sources of calcium in their diets. Simply encouraging sedentary women to walk more may not achieve the improvement in average BMD level shown in this study, if other differences between the two groups are ignored.</p><p>b. The plots of the data and the estimated regression lines suggest that increased calcium intake from milk consumption by women in their 20s is associated with higher average BMD levels. (Note: Higher levels of milk consumption by women in their 20s could be associated with a history of higher levels of milk consumption as children and teenagers and later as adults.)</p><p>c. This limits the conclusions that can be made about possible effects of exercise on BMD. If higher levels of milk consumption provide calcium needed to promote higher BMD levels, and sedentary women tend to have lower levels of milk consumption than walkers do, then all or part of the difference in BMD means for the two groups could be due to higher levels of calcium intake among walkers and not the physical activity.</p><p></p><p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and
