With a variable such as income, a small number of very large incomes could dramatically increase the mean but not the median. Therefore, the median would provide a better estimate of a typical income value.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>Method 2 is better than Method 1. A sample obtained from Method 1 could be biased because of the voluntary nature of the response. It is plausible that class members with larger incomes might be more likely to return the form than class members with smaller incomes. The mean income for such a sample would overestimate the mean income of all class members. With Method 2, despite the smaller sample size, the random selection is likely to result in a sample that is more representative of the entire class and produce an unbiased estimate of mean yearly income of all class members.</p><p></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>This question is scored in three sections.

Part (b) has two components: (1) identifying a relevant characteristic for each sampling method; (2) indicating the effect of the biased method on the estimate of the mean income. Section 1 consists of Part (a); section 2 consists of part (b), component 1; and section 3 consists of part (b), component 2. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Section 1</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following two components:</p><ol><li><p>Describes how skewness or outliers affect the mean or do not affect the median.</p></li><li><p>Makes a conjecture about a relevant characteristic of the distribution of incomes, such as skewness or an outlier.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>For Component 1, examples of responses that are acceptable include:</p><ul><li><p>The mean is affected by skewness (outliers).</p></li><li><p>The median is not affected by skewness (outliers).</p></li><li><p>The mean is greater (less) than the median when there is right (left) skewness or outliers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>For Component 1, examples of responses that <strong>are not</strong> acceptable include:</p><ul><li><p>Don’t use the mean for skewed distributions or distributions with outliers.</p></li><li><p>Use the median for skewed distributions or distributions with outliers.</p></li><li><p>Responses that include an incorrect statement about means and/or medians, such as for right skewed distributions, the median will be higher than the mean.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>It is possible to satisfy <em>both</em> components with a single sentence, such as, “If there was a billionaire in the sample, the mean would be higher than the median.”</p></li><li><p>If a response argues that using the <em>mean</em> is a more appropriate way to estimate the typical income, then reduce the score in section 1 by one level (that is, from E to P or from P to I).</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Section 2</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response chooses Method 2 <em>AND</em> includes the following two components:</p><ol><li><p>Identifies a relevant characteristic of Method 1.</p></li><li><p>Identifies a relevant characteristic of Method 2.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response chooses Method 2 <em>AND</em> includes only one of the two components listed above<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response includes both components but does not choose a method.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response chooses Method 1 OR otherwise does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>Responses that do not explicitly choose Method 2 can still earn an E for section 2 if the choice is clearly implied. The choice of Method 2 is clearly implied if the response only discusses negative characteristics of Method 1 and only discusses positive characteristics of Method 2, such as, Method 1 is biased but Method 2 uses a random sample.</p></li><li><p>Responses that <em>compare</em> the two methods can satisfy <em>both</em> components, such as, saying that Method 1 is more biased or that nonresponse will be less of a problem with Method 2.</p></li><li><p>Responses that refer to the nonresponse bias as v<em>oluntary response bias, response bias, undercoverage</em> can still earn an E.</p></li><li><p>Discussions of conditions for inference should be considered extraneous and ignored.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Section 3</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following two components:</p><ol><li><p>Indicates the incomes of responders may be different from the incomes of nonresponders.</p></li><li><p>Indicates the biased sampling method may produce a misleading estimate/conclusion about the mean income, including direction, for example, “The sample mean is likely to be higher than the mean of the population.”</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides only one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>A single sentence can satisfy the first component of section 2 and the first component of section 3. (For example, “In method 1, rich people are more likely to respond.”)</p></li><li><p>For component 2, either direction is acceptable but the direction must be consistent with the identified bias. Saying only that Method 2 will be more accurate or more representative does not satisfy component 2.</p></li><li><p>If a response addresses possible nonresponse bias in Method 2, the response can still satisfy both components of section 3.</p></li><li><p>Responses that focus on the larger sample size in Method 1 can satisfy component 2 if such responses describe the effect as reducing the variability of the estimate. (For example, “I would use Method 1 since the larger sample size would give less variability of the mean.”)</p></li><li><p>Responses that focus on untruthful survey answers can satisfy component 2 if the effect on the estimate is appropriate. (For example, “People contacted in Method 2 might say they make more money than they actually do.
