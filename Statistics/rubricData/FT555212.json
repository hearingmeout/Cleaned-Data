The order of the treatments will be randomly assigned to the subjects. For example, for each patient flip a coin to determine which treatment will be administered first. Measure diastolic blood pressure, then have the subject sit quietly for 20 minutes in either a noise-free environment or in a room where soothing music is played, depending on which treatment was selected at random (based on the coin flip).

For each pair, toss a coin to determine which member of the pair will be assigned to group 1, and then assign the other member of the pair to group 2. For group 1, measure diastolic blood pressure, then have the subjects sit quietly in a noise-free environment for 20 minutes, and then measure diastolic blood pressure again and compute its change (<em>after − before</em>). For group 2, the plan is the same, except that they will sit for 20 minutes in a room where soothing music is played between blood pressure measurements.</p><p>When the data have been collected, the difference (<em>music − noise-free</em>) in the change in diastolic blood pressure will be computed for each pair, and then a paired <em>t</em>-test will be run to see if the mean difference is significantly different from zero.</p><p><br><strong>Approach 3: Completely Randomized Design</strong> (This is not as good a choice as the two previous approaches, but because of the large number of subjects available for each treatment group, it is considered an acceptable solution.)</p><p>Assign the 100 patients numbers from 00 to 99. From a random number table, select 50 unique numbers; the patients with the selected values will form group 1; the remaining 50 patients will form group 2.
