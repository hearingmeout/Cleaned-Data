The other 150 would be assigned to the standard filter group.<br>OR<br>For each subject, flip a coin. If the coin lands H, assign the subject to the new filter group; otherwise assign the subject to the standard filter group. Continue in this way until one of the groups has 150 subjects. Assign all remaining subjects to the other group.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><blockquote><p>Without a comparison group, the cholesterol level could change overall, but we would not be able to determine whether the observed change was due to some other extraneous variable that changed during the 10-week period. For example, diet might change with time of the year, and the diet might result in changes in cholesterol changes. So a change in cholesterol would not be attributable to the new coffee filter. The addition of a control group enables the researchers to assess the mean change in cholesterol level due to the coffee filter, as opposed to just determining if the cholesterol level changed. The control group eliminates the confounding variable of another change that might have occurred over the 10-week period.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><blockquote><p>The two-sample <em>t</em> test for means or mean differences would be used (or the two-sample <em>z</em> test for means).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><blockquote><p>If it is known that smoking is related to changes in cholesterol level, it would be best to control for smoking by using only nonsmokers. This eliminates smoking as a source of variability, creating more homogenous groups, enabling more direct comparisons between the treatment and control groups and more precise estimates of the treatment effects (though we will only be able to generalize the results to nonsmokers).</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the student describes a method that is</p><ol><li><p>based on random assignment and</p></li><li><p>will result in equal numbers of subjects in each group</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the student does any of the following</p><ul><li><p>describes a method based on random assignment, but that does not ensure an equal number of subjects in each group.</p></li><li><p>attempts to describe a method of random assignment that ensures 150 subjects in each group, but the explanation of random assignment is not clear or incomplete.
