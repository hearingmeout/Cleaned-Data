Males tend to select football and basketball more often than females, whereas females tend to select gymnastics and swimming more often than males. The relative frequencies are similar for baseball between males and females.</p><p>Part (b):</p><p>The appropriate statistical test is a chi-squared test for independence. The number of degrees of freedom is (5 - 1) x (2 x 1) = 4.</p><p>Part (c):</p><p>The p-value, based on a chi-squared test statistic of 10.77 and determined using technology, is approximately 0.029. This p-value is smaller than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the sample data provides convincing statistical evidence that there is an association between gender and sport preference in the population of all students at this school.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and (c) were scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I):</p><p><strong>Part (a) </strong>is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly identifies at least one sport for which males exhibit a higher relative frequency than females, and at least one sport for which females exhibit a higher relative frequency than males; <br><em>OR </em><br>correctly identifies at least one sport for which the relative frequencies for males and females are different, and at least one sport for which the relative frequencies for males and females are similar; <br><em>OR </em><br>correctly identifies at least two differences between the distributions of sport preferences for males and females.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly identifies at least one sport for which males have a higher relative frequency or at least one sport for which females have a higher relative frequency, but not both; <br><em>OR </em><br>correctly identifies one difference between the distributions of sport preferences for males and females.
