Because the apples are randomly selected, and each apple’s weight is approximately normally distributed, T is also approximately normal with mean equal to the sum of the means of the distribution of each of the 5 apple’s weights, <em>E</em>(<em>T</em>) = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 5(9) = 45 ounces, and a variance equal to the sum of the variances of the five apples, <em>Var</em>(<em>T</em> ) = (0.75)<sup>2 </sup>+ (0.75)<sup>2 </sup>+ (0.75)<sup>2 </sup>+ (0.75)<sup>2 </sup>+ (0.75)<sup>2 </sup>+ 5(0.75) = 2.8125 ounces squared.

The expected value (mean) of <em>W</em> is <em>E(W) </em>= <em>E</em>(10 + <em>T</em>) = <em>E</em>(10) +<em> E</em>(<em>T</em>) = 10 + 45 = ounces. The variance of <em>W</em> is Var(<em>W</em>) = Var(10 + <em>T</em>) = Var(10) + Var(<em>T</em>) = 0 + 2.8125 = 2.8125 ounces squared. Thus, <em>W</em> has a standard deviation of <em>σ<sub>W</sub></em> = √(2.8125) ≈ 1.677 ounces, because adding a constant to a random variable does not change its variance or standard deviation.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and (c) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p></p><p><strong>Part (a) </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly provides all three components of the distribution of the total weight, with appropriate justification: shape (approximately normal), center (mean is 45 ounces), and spread (standard deviation is 1.677 ounces).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly gives only two of the three components with appropriate justification.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p></p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b) </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response shows the correct probability with a correct normal probability calculation method;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response shows the correct probability with a well-labeled sketch.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response sets up a correct normal probability calculation but does not carry it through correctly;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response uses the standard deviation given in the stem of the problem and carries out a correct normal probability calculation.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Notes</em>:</p><ul><li><p>If the normal probability calculation in part (b) includes an incorrect value for the mean or standard deviation as obtained in part (a), part (b) should be scored as E if the probability calculation is carried out correctly.</p></li><li><p>A response that arrives at the correct answer in the context of a significance test lowers the score by one level (that is, from E to P, or P to I).</p></li><li><p>A response that includes an incorrect mathematical statement lowers the score by one level (that is, from E to P, or P to I).</p></li><li><p>Because the probability distribution and its parameter values were asked for in part (a), the response does not have to repeat that information in part (b) to earn an E.</p><p></p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c) </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides the correct values for the two parameters (mean and standard deviation) with appropriate justification for each.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides the correct values, with appropriate justification, for only one of the two parameters.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes</em>:</p><ul><li><p>An incorrect mean and/or standard deviation carried through into part (c) and used in calculating the mean and standard deviation, with appropriate justification, is acceptable for an E.</p></li><li><p>Appropriate justification may be provided through a correct calculation or written explanation.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><br></p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>All three parts essentially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part partially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part incorrect<br><em>OR</em><br>One part essentially correct and one or two parts partially correct<br><em>OR</em><br>Three parts partially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>One part essentially correct and no parts partially correct<br><em>OR</em><br>No parts essentially correct and two parts partially correct</p></blockquote>"]}]
