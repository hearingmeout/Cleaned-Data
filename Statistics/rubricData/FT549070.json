The form of the association does not appear to be linear. Among machines that cost less than $500, there appears to be very little association between price and quality rating. But the machines that cost more than $500 do generally have better quality ratings than those that cost less than $500, which causes the overall association to be positive.</p><p></p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The sewing machine that most affects the appropriateness of using a linear regression model is the one that costs about $2,200 and has a quality rating of about 65. Although the other four sewing machines costing more than $500 generally have higher quality ratings than those costing under $500, their prices and quality ratings follow a trend that suggests that quality ratings may not continue to increase with higher prices, but instead may approach a maximum possible quality rating. The $2,200 sewing machine is the most expensive of all but has a relatively low quality rating, which is consistent with a nonlinear model that approaches a maximum possible quality rating and then perhaps decreases. If a linear model were fit to all of the data, this one machine would substantially pull the regression line toward it, resulting in a poor overall fit of the line to the data.</p><p></p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>According to Chris’s criterion, there are two sewing machine models that he will consider buying:</p><blockquote><p>1. The model that costs a bit more than $100 and has a quality rating of 65.</p><p>2. The model that costs a bit below $500 and has a quality rating of 81 or 82.</p></blockquote><p>The data points corresponding to these two machines have been circled on the scatterplot below.<br></p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/e5875cbdb5d5d21a8fda98b6eb58c564/original.png\" alt=\"A scatter plot is shown with quality rating from 40 to 85 in increments of 5 on the vertical axis and price in dollars from 0 to 2500 in increments of 250 on the horizontal axis.
