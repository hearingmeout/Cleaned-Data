Each partially correct (P) section counts as ½ point. If a response is between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to decide whether to score up or down, depending on the overall strength of the response and communication, particularly in parts (a) and (d). However, a response that earns a P or an I in section 4 cannot receive a score of 4.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p>"]}]
