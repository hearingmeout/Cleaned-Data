From the table of binomial probabilities computed in part (c), the probability that two or fewer of the individuals (<em>X</em> ≤ 2) or six or more of the individuals (<em>X</em> ≥ 6) prefer Citrus Fresh when <em>p</em> = 0.5 is 2 × (0.003906 + 0.031250 + 0.109375) = 0.289062. Because the <em>p</em>-value of 0.289062 is greater than any reasonable significance level, say 0.070312, we would not reject the null hypothesis that <em>p</em> = 0.5. That is, we do not have statistically significant evidence for a consumer preference between Citrus Fresh and Tropical Taste.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (f):</strong></p><blockquote><p>Increase the number of consumers involved in the preference test. More consumers will give you more data, and you will be better able to detect a difference between the population proportion of consumers who prefer Citrus Fresh and 0.5. The sample proportion in the initial study was only 0.25 (2/8), but we were not able to reject the null hypothesis that <em>p =</em> ½<em>.</em> By increasing the number of consumers, a difference of that magnitude would allow the null hypothesis to be rejected.
