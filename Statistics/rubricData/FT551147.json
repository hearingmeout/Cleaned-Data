Suppose the frog-loving students tend to select the computer simulation method (perhaps because they do not like the notion of dissecting the frogs they love). The possible low change between pretest and posttest scores for the computer simulation group might then be attributed to the students’ already knowing a lot about frog anatomy beforehand, not to the instructional method itself.

The assigned numbers will be listed in ascending order. The students with the lowest 12 numbers in the ordered list will receive the instructional program that requires physically dissecting frogs. The students with the highest 12 numbers will receive the instructional program that uses computer software to simulate the dissection of a frog.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (a) </strong>alternative (randomized block design):</p><blockquote><p>Students will be paired or placed into blocks of size two, based on having similar pretest scores. So, the first block will contain the two students with the two lowest pretest scores, the second block will contain the two students with the third- and fourth-lowest pretest scores, and so on, with the last block containing the two students with the two highest pretest scores. In each block, the students will be assigned a unique random number using a random number generator on a calculator, statistical software, or a random number table. The student in each block with the lower random number will receive the instructional program that requires physically dissecting frogs, and the student with the higher random number will receive the instructional program that uses computer software to simulate the dissection of a frog.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><blockquote><p>By not randomizing and allowing the students to self-select, there is a potential for changes to occur in the differences between pretest and posttest scores for a particular group because of the characteristics of students who choose a particular instructional method, not because of the instructional method itself. For example, suppose frog-loving students already know a lot about frog anatomy; one would therefore expect these students to be less likely to show a large change between the pretest and posttest scores. Suppose the frog-loving students tend to select the computer simulation method (perhaps because they do not like the notion of dissecting the frogs they love). The possible low change between pretest and posttest scores for the computer simulation group might then be attributed to the students’ already knowing a lot about frog anatomy beforehand, not to the instructional method itself. The frog dissection group might see a larger change in scores because the students entering this group are those with the lower pretest scores (less prior knowledge) and who are thus more likely to show greater improvement between pretest and posttest scores.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a) and (b) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).<br></p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if a proper method of randomization is described that (1) creates two groups of equal size; <em>AND</em> (2) assigns the <strong>named</strong> treatments to the groups in a manner that knowledgeable statistics users would employ to assign the students to the two instructional groups.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if only one of the two criteria above is met.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if neither criterion is met.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>Coin tossing (or equivalent method) using a stopping rule to obtain equal sample sizes requires placing the students in the class in a random order.
