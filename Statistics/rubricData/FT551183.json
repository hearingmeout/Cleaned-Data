Therefore the probability that the first 30 igniters tested do not fail is (0.85)30 ≈ 0.0076. The solution can also be written as (1 – 0.15)30 ≈ 0.0076.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>Given that there are no failures in the first 30 trials, the probability that the first failure occurs on the 31st trial is 0.15, and the probability that it does not occur on the 31st but occurs on the 32nd trial is (0.85)(0.15) = 0.1275. Therefore the probability that the first failure occurs on the 31st or 32nd super igniter tested is 0.15 + 0.1275 = 0.2775.</p><p>Note that this is equivalent to asking for the probability that the first failure occurs on the first or second trial, which is 0.15 + (0.85)(0.15) = 0.2775.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>The result of the probability calculation in part (a) provides a reason to believe that the failure rate of the super igniters is less than 15 percent. The calculated probability of 0.0076 shows that there is less than a 1 percent chance that 30 or more igniters in a row would not fail if the failure rate was 15 percent. This probability is smaller than conventional significance levels such as <em>α </em>= 0.05 or <em>α</em> = 0.01, and thus is small enough to make it reasonable to believe that the failure rate of the super igniters is less than 15 percent.<br></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and (c) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response gives the correct probability <em>AND</em> correct justification.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly notes that the answer is the probability that there will be 30 successes in 30 attempts, but does not carry out a correct probability calculation;
