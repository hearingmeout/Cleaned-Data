Black circles connected by dashed lines represent the western pacific four year moving average. Starting in 2000 the averages are approximately 33, 34, 37, 36, 35, 32, 31, 30.5, 28, 29, and 25. The point at 25 is indicated by a large black square. White squares connected by solid lines represent the eastern pacific four year moving average. Starting in 2000 the averages are approximately 18, 17, 18, 19, 17, 16, 19, 19.5, 20.5, 22, and 20.\"></p></blockquote><p>Part (e):</p><blockquote><p>(i) The overall trends across this time period were more apparent with the moving averages than with the original frequencies.

If a response is between two scores (for example, 2 ½ points), use a holistic approach to determine whether to score up or down, depending on the overall strength of the response and communication.
