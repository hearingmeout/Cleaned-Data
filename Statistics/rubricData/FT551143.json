Females were less likely than males to have had a part-time job during summer only or to have had a part-time job not only during summer. If there is no association between the two variables, one would expect the heights of the bars for gender within each job-experience category to be about the same. Based on the sample data summarized in the graphical display, there appears to be an association between job experience and gender.</p></blockquote><p>Part (c):</p><blockquote><p>The appropriate test of significance is the chi-square test of association or independence.</p><p>The appropriate hypotheses are:</p><p>H<sub>0</sub>: There is no association between gender and job experience.</p><p>H<sub>a</sub>: There is an association between gender and job experience.</p><p>OR</p><p>H<sub>0</sub>: Gender and job experience are independent.</p><p>H<sub>a</sub>: Gender and job experience are not independent.</p></blockquote><p><br><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and (c) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if an appropriate graph is drawn correctly and all labels are provided.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the graphical display is drawn correctly but some labels are missing.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if a partial graph is drawn (such as for one job-experience category only) <em>OR</em> if the graphical display is incorrectly drawn or inappropriate.</p><p><em>Note:</em> A segmented bar graph, a bar graph conditioning on gender, and pie charts are acceptable graphical displays.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the student correctly discusses percentages for both genders within each category of job experience.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the student correctly discusses percentages for both genders within only one or two of the job-experience categories.</p><p>Incorrect (I) otherwise.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>Stating that there is no obvious gender difference for “Part-time job during summer only” is acceptable.</p></li><li><p>If an incomplete graph is drawn in part (a), the student may receive an (E) for part (b) if a discussion of the percentages for both genders in all three job-experience categories is provided.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the student recommends using the chi-square test of association or independence and states correct hypotheses in context.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the student recommends using an incorrect test but states correct hypotheses in context for a chi-square test of association or independence OR if the student names the correct test but does not give correct hypotheses in context.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the student recommends any incorrect statistical test and does not state correct hypotheses in context for a chi-square test of association or independence.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>If a student names merely the “chi-square test,” this will be accepted if the hypotheses for a chi-square test of association or independence are provided.</p></li><li><p>If a student recommends the chi-square test of homogeneity but states correct hypotheses for that test in context, score part (c) as partially correct.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>All three parts essentially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part partially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>Two parts essentially correct and no part partially correct</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>One part essentially correct and one or two parts partially correct</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>Three parts partially correct</p></blockquote><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><blockquote><p>One part essentially correct and no parts partially correct</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>No parts essentially correct and two parts partially correct</p></blockquote>"]}]
