It is estimated that the average time to finish checkout if there are no other customers in line is 72.95 seconds.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The coefficient of determination is r<sup>2</sup> = 73.33%. This value indicates that 73.33% of the variability in the times it takes customers to finish checkout, including time waiting in line, can be explained by knowing how many customers are in line in front of the selected customer.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>The outlier is the point with x = 3 and y close to 0. This point is considered an outlier because the combination of x and y values differs from the pattern of the rest of the data.
