Within each plot, obtain a simple random sample of 5 percent of the trees by using a random number generator to generate unique random integers from 1 to n.

Using a random number generator, such as a random number table or a random number generator from a calculator or computer, generate 10 unique random integers from 1 to 200. Select the plots corresponding to the 10 integers. Measure the diameters of all trees in the 10 selected plots.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><blockquote><p>In each of the 200 plots, number each of the trees from 1 to n, where n is the number of trees in that plot. Within each plot, obtain a simple random sample of 5 percent of the trees by using a random number generator to generate unique random integers from 1 to n. Select the trees corresponding to the integers and measure the tree diameters.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><blockquote><p>An advantage of using the cluster sample instead of the stratified sample is that the cluster sample is much easier to obtain. For the cluster sample, only 10 plots must be visited and the trees do not need to be individually numbered.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><blockquote><p>If the distribution of tree diameters is different in different parts of the forest, an advantage of using stratified random sampling instead of cluster sampling is that the stratified sampling is more likely to result in a sample that is representative of the population of all tree diameters. Cluster sampling is more likely to yield a sample in which trees with large diameters or trees with small diameters are over-represented simply by chance.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>The question is scored in three sections.
