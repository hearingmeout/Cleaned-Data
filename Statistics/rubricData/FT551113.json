Independent random samples</p><p>2. Large samples or normal population distributions</p><p>One sample of 150 patients divided into two groups after sampling does not meet the condition of two independent random samples with fixed sample sizes. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that mode of transportation splits the patients into two independent groups. Secondly, use of the two sample t interval is reasonable because each sample size is large (e.g., <em>n</em>A = 77 &gt; 30 and <em>n</em>S= 73 &gt; 30). Alternatively, we could assume that the waiting times are (at least approximately) normally distributed, but we have no way to check this assumption with the information provided.</p></blockquote><p>Step 2: Correct Mechanics</p><blockquote><p>Degrees of freedom = min {(77-1),(73-1)}= 72.</p><p>-2.26 ± 2.6459(0.7777)</p><p>-2.26 ± 2.0577</p><p>(-4.3177, -0.2023)</p></blockquote><p>Step 3: Interpretation</p><blockquote><p>Based on this sample, we are 99 percent confident that the true difference in the populations’ mean waiting times (ambulance − self) is between −4.3177 minutes and −0.2023 minutes. Equivalently, With 99 percent confidence, the true mean wait time for those who arrive by ambulance is shorter than those who are self transported by somewhere between 0.2 and 4.3 minutes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>Since zero is not in the 99 percent confidence interval of plausible values for the true difference in means, we can reject H0 : μA - μS = 0 in favor of the alternative : HA : μA - μS ≠ 0 at the α = .01 significance level. Thus, we have statistically significant evidence that there is a difference in the mean wait times for the two groups</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Part (a) is scored according to the number of correct steps.
