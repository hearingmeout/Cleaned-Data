This is a completely randomized design. The response variable is the amount of tread wear, which can be found by taking the difference in the tread on the rear tire at the outset and the tread on the rear tire after six months of use.</p><p>b. Place one tire with the new compound and one tire with the standard compound on each bicycle. Randomly choose 30 of the 60 bicycles, and place the tire with the new compound on the front for those bicycles and the tire with the new compound on the rear for the remaining 30 bicycles. Randomly distribute the bicycles to the students. Since students use bicycles differently, this design will ensure that each tire is exposed to similar conditions. (Note: This design would be stronger if the front and rear positions of the new and standard tires on each bicycle are interchanged after the first three months of the study.)</p><p>c. A matched-pairs t-test would determine whether tires produced using the new compound have longer tread life than tires produced using the standard compound.</p><p></p><p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p><p>Parts (a) and (b) are each scored as essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect.
