Therefore, it is plausible that the computer program is generating discounts with a probability of 0.20, and the confidence interval does not provide convincing statistical evidence that the program is not working as intended.</p></li><li><p>No. The confidence interval includes values from 0.09 to 0.21, so any value in that interval is a plausible value for the probability that the computer is using to generate discounts.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The formula for computing the margin of error for a proportion includes the square root of the sample size in the denominator. For a random sample that is four times the size of the original sample, the margin of error can be determined by dividing the margin of error of the original sample by two. Therefore, the new margin of error is 0.03.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>Using the margin of error of 0.03 obtained from the second sample, the confidence interval for <em>p</em> is 0.15 ± 0.03 or (0.12, 0.18). The interval does not include 0.20, and therefore, there is convincing evidence that the computer program is not working as intended and is not generating discounts with a probability of 0.20.</p><p></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections. Section 1 consists of part (a-i); section 2 consists of part (a-ii); section 3 consists of part (b); and section 4 consists of part (c). Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Section 1 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response states that because the interval contains 0.20, it does not provide convincing statistical evidence that the computer program is not working as intended.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response indicates that it is necessary to check whether the value of 0.20 is in the computed interval, but there are errors in implementation. Examples of errors include:</p><ul><li><p>The response notes that 0.20 is within the interval but does not draw a conclusion.</p></li><li><p>The response has an arithmetic error in the computation of the endpoints of the interval but provides a correct conclusion with justification that is consistent with the computed interval.</p></li></ul><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not recognize how to use the confidence interval to check whether the computer is working correctly;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response states that the interval shows that the proportion is equal to 0.20;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response notes that 0.20 is within the interval and concludes that the program is not working as intended;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response otherwise does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Section 2</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response concludes that there is not convincing statistical evidence that the computer program generates the discount with a probability of 0.20 AND justifies the conclusion by noting that there are values other than 0.20 in the interval.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly concludes that there is not convincing evidence that the computer program generates the discount with a probability of 0.20, but provides incomplete reasoning to justify the conclusion.</p><p>Examples of incomplete reasoning include:</p><ul><li><p>stating that 0.20 is a plausible value for the proportion of discounts without giving further explanation;</p></li><li><p>indicating that having 0.20 in the interval does not prove that 0.20 is the true proportion; and</p></li><li><p>providing a generic statistical argument, such as reference to the fact that the null hypothesis should never be accepted, or stating that not rejecting the null hypothesis is not proof that 0.20 is the true proportion of bills discounted.</p></li></ul><p><em>Note:</em> If an incorrect interval is computed in part (a-i) that does not contain 0.20, and in part (a-ii) the response concludes that the program is not generating discounts with a probability of 0.20 because 0.20 is not in the interval, section 2 is scored as P.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response states that there is evidence that the computer program generates the discount with a probability of 0.20;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response correctly concludes that there is not convincing evidence that the computer program generates the discount with a probability of 0.20 AND provides incorrect or no justification;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response otherwise does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Section 3</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response gives the correct value of 0.03 as the new margin of error by using the correct formula or by providing a correct explanation that recognizes that quadrupling the sample size divides the margin of error from the original sample by two.</p><p><em>Note:</em> If the response relies on the margin of error formula and

depends on the square root of the sample size;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response calculates a margin of error that is greater than or equal to 0.06;<br><em>OR<br></em>if the response otherwise does

essentially correct (E) section counts as 1 point.
