Normality and parameters: Indicates use of a normal (or approximately normal) distribution and clearly identifies the correct parameter values. (Showing correct components in a z—score, labeling the mean and standard deviation in a normalcdf calculator statement, or drawing a normal curve with sufficient values marked to indicate the mean and standard deviation are all sufficient methods for identifying the correct parameter values.)</p><p>2. Boundary and direction: Uses the correct boundary value of X = 137 or z = 0.8 and the correct direction. (Showing correct boundary and direction in a probability statement using ”greater than,” labeling the lower limit and upper limit in a normalcdf calculator statement, drawing a normal curve with 137 labeled and an indication that the area of interest is to the right of 137, or a conclusion in words using ”greater than. ”)</p><p>3. Probability: Reports the correct normal probability consistent with the response’s setup described in components 1 and 2.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly provides only two of the three components.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response gives the answer with no work shown or otherwise does not satisfy the criteria for E or P.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>An inconsistency in calculations lowers the score for part (a) by one level (from E to P, or from P to I). For instance, if the response states the requested probability as P(X &gt; 137), but actually computes P(X &lt; 137).</p><p>An error in statistical notation, such as using s instead of a for the standard deviation or r instead of y for the mean, does not satisfy component 1.</p><p>A correct direction can be obtained by using a left direction and an upper bound of 137 and then subtracting the value of the cumulative probability from 1. However, simply showing the calculation 1 — 0.7881 = 0.2119 does NOT give a correct direction.</p><p>Consider any steps of a hypothesis test as extraneous work.</p><p>Standard notations such as N(133,5) or N(133,25) satisfy the first component.</p><p>A sketch of the normal curve with 133 and 138 in the appropriate positions satisfies the first component.</p><p>Use of a value other than 137 does not satisfy the second component.</p><p>If the only error in part (a) is the reversal of the numerator for the z—score (133 — 137), the response is scored as P.</p><p>For calculator notation:</p><p>ncdf is sufficient to indicate use of the normal distribution.</p><p>Stating the lower and upper bounds is sufficient for identifying boundary and direction.</p><p>Minimum notation, such as ”u” for upper, is sufficient for identifying boundary.</p><p>The minimum value for an upper bound must be at least 4 standard deviations above the mean.</p><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the probability is computed correctly, AND work is shown that includes correct numerical values using a formula, end results from a tree diagram, or some other appropriate method.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides a correct strategy for finding the probability, such as a formula or tree diagram, but uses one or more incorrect values or does not use the end result from the tree;</p><p>OR</p><p>if the response gives the correct probability but not enough work is shown to determine how it was found. Incorrect if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>A response that uses 0.3 for J and 0.7 for K earns a P if no other mistakes are made.</p><p>Tree diagrams:</p><p>If used, the multiplication is implied, but the addition must be indicated.</p><p>If not used, both the multiplication and the addition must be indicated.</p><p>The shown work might be found in part (c).</p><p>Probabilities can be shown in a table.
