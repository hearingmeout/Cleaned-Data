Thus, the expected electricity production is 10 × 0.240 = 2.40 amperes higher on a day with 25 mph wind velocity as compared to a day with 15 mph wind velocity.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>The proportion of variation in electricity production that is explained by the linear relationship with wind speed is R2, which the regression output reports to be 0.873.</p><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><p>Yes, there is very strong statistical evidence that the population slope differs from zero, so electricity production is linearly related to wind speed. For testing the hypotheses H0 : 𝛽 = 0 versus Ha : 𝛽 ≠ 0, where 𝛽 represents the population slope, the output reveals that the test statistic is <em>t</em> = 12.63 and the <em>p</em>-value (to three decimal places) is 0.000. Because the <em>p</em>-value is so small (much less than both 0.05 and 0.01), the sample data provide very strong statistical evidence that electricity production is linearly related to wind speed.</p><p></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P) or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response gives the correct equation AND includes the following two components:</p><p>Provides correct variable names (with context).</p><p>Uses a modifier such as “expected” or “predicted” or “estimated” (or a “hat” symbol) with the response variable, electricity production.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response gives the correct equation <em>AND</em> includes exactly one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response identifies and uses the correct slope value (0.240) <em>OR</em> the slope value identified in part (a) of the response</p><p><em>AND</em></p><p>the response includes the following three components:</p><p>Shows work (correct multiplication or correct substitution into an appropriate expression).</p><p>Arrives at an answer.</p><p>Provides correct measurement units (amperes).</p><p><em>Note:</em> Calculating predicted values for both wind speeds and taking their difference is sufficient, as long as measurement units are provided.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response identifies and uses the correct slope value (0.240) or the slope value identified in part (a) of the response <em>AND</em> includes exactly two of the three components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if response is 0.873.</p><p><em>Note: </em>No work needs to be shown to earn an E, because the answer is read from the computer output.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response gives the value of adjusted R2, rather than R2, <em>OR</em> the response approximates (or rounds) the value of R2.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response gives neither R2 nor adjusted R2, or if the response reports the square root of R2.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d) </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following three components:</p><p>Gives the correct conclusion based on a test for the population slope.</p><p>Reports the correct p-value and/or <em>t</em>-statistic.</p><p>Provides linkage/justification between the <em>p</em>-value (or <em>t</em>-statistic) and the conclusion.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides exactly two of the three components listed above.</p><p>Note: If the wrong p-value is chosen, but the conclusion is consistent with that p-value and linkage or justification is provided, the response earns a P.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response fails to meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p>Each essentially correct (E) part counts as 1 point.
