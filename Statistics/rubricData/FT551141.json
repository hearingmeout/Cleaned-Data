From the regression output and graph, we see that students with low pretest scores benefit more from attending magnet schools, as compared with students with low pretest scores at the original school. Also at the magnet school, students with low pretest scores benefit more than students with high pretest scores. In other words, students at the magnet school all score high on the posttest, regardless of how they scored on the pretest. But at the original school, only students who scored high on the pretest scored high on the posttest.</p></blockquote><p><br><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if all four components are correct.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if two or three components are correct.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if at most one component is correct.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if all four components—both equations and both interpretations in (i) and (ii)—are correct.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if two or three components are correct.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if at most one component is correct.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if all four components—both <em>p</em>-values and both conclusions in (i) and (ii)—are correct.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if two or three components are correct.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if at most one component is correct.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response clearly explains how the regression analyses provide additional information in this context by addressing the impact of the magnet school on students with low pretest scores.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response clearly describes how the regression analyses provide additional information in context but does not explain the impact of the magnet school on students with low pretest scores.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for an E or P.</p></blockquote><p>Each essentially correct (E) response counts as 1 point.

We need to check the assumption that the distributions of differences (posttest – pretest) for each of the two schools are normally distributed. Based on histograms and boxplots of these differences, there are no outliers or extreme skewness. Because these graphs reveal no obvious departures from normality, it appears reasonable to proceed with the t-test.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/054e446cbfed056496d4f980c5da1be4/original.png?Signature=enCULs1GR%2BNt50Ng41X%2Fex5omq4%3D&amp;Expires=1627474794&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZKRTTBQD4E&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEGQaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQDiUk4wyKwcQChFGCV/6%2BNcHvaGp4xw4m46qoxlKNp6%2BwIhAM%2B6rIvS9FWMwR2EnTP4c3FlBCSC%2BRXgzxC1V3GVY2u1KvoDCG0QAhoMMjgxMzk0NTIxNjg1Igx3LAPKB3hgl6VUxvAq1wPQCUw7%2B8pOQSy2iJZLdfLWLQp/KbYML4xYhA/0fTUqB6fViO5wWdX0K%2BUq0s/Dulbg2u7LmUaEv4UIwuGsuNNDkzQ99ky2O7RJJtRzm2hxLCMDFa/Fh/I0qI2bzcKrhdhmFadpgtQMTjW99v6frt2OinsAj1MjyGDfeQAsBvwyxljxnHxvBtjSVs1ve7fsyHm7gIyJxadSYtYnMoRryT2/2WUnw6fawT79jhW/0aTKqt7BgCpSKyc6MtfsoRas/oBmlvzUfajr8tx4GHu6qzId5zbiiNcyn7gEwTXNEqRpx6iyE6fSEG/hNvEQ3HRJfxqYi9x66FEg8LM73CJN3lxDHFL44X3tJfVnI2W3BmklU5YJotNL9wyRI3l5xAgMLkXqXUvwDCS%2BsZkwG6deWnkjRmYr0qSiXJ%2BSJX991%2BmgBQ4754Ofv8bb3FMdUKviCUkJuqPrzjbqxf1vR8ZB/Td2GXaSe2t1tk72DlsgE/wNU1qSqbR79AJ3n8KJu%2BmLE2PHUg8rs3MIjYZ1GftjNByrD1hMkM%2BW/fbZfANlkaIn27h0E2mgVf8MGhg13FS95/Usxoxla3MNtopmQtwSF4Us/X06sh25PgqU8FK9es5UzvH8s0fd0o4wuKCDiAY6pAFS%2BNXRLxWLzpfc%2Bv768kSoGsQCiX2dC3mlD5Qv6K9/wjy3rwwrEmG6xmbYvoVlo6WigiBcVnIL6q9H%2BDq5%2Bi3h3MwtqXAqzQkPRbx7iuuOwedpDxbk3ayqiJTSgvR5kqOMmWyZEWk898xaZ32Xvkhhd78q/ZABKvaJ36FZ2nD1%2Beh30SPfm%2BWYc0qH8pjCfuMKyVbEASyrQpEQiUMy8CafzYumxA%3D%3D\" alt=\"A figure is shown with two graphs.
