[{"id":"FT545017_rubric_category_0","type":"custom","title":"Overall","stimulusHtml":"<p><strong>Intent of Question:</strong></p><p>The purpose of this question is to assess the student’s ability to work with a linear regression model; describe how a simulation could be performed in a study; and use that simulation method to determine which of two possible expressions provides an appropriate method for constructing a confidence interval for the slope of a least-squares regression line with an intercept of 0.</p><p></p><p><strong>Sample Correct Response:</strong></p><p>a. One assumption is that the random errors at each volume have the same variance. The level of variation in the mass measurements about the true mass does not vary with the volume. A second assumption is that the random errors at each volume are normally distributed.</p><p>b. A 95 percent confidence interval for the slope is 1.3812 ± (2.365)(0.00876) or (1.3605, 1.4019) kg/mL. Since a 95 percent confidence interval has a probability of 0.95 of containing the true value, and the interval provided by the data includes 1.37, this result is consistent with a material with a true density of 1.37 kg/mL.</p><p>c. The intercept represents the mean mass in kilograms for a sample with a volume of 0.</p><p>d. Since a sample with no volume should have no mass, it would be very reasonable to consider a regression model with an intercept of 0.</p><p>e. The basic steps for simulating a data set with nine observations are: </p><p>• Use a calculator or computer to generate a random observation z from a standard normal distribution.</p><p>• For a specific volume, compute a simulated mass measurement as y = 1.3966× volume + 0.7925× z .</p><p>• Repeat each step in the previous two bulleted statements for each of the nine amounts—10, 20, 30, 40, 50,</p><p>60, 70, 80, and 90—to obtain a sample of nine mass measurements.</p><p>f. The engineer would need to simulate a large number of data sets, say 10,000, using the procedure described in part (e). For each simulated data set, the engineer would need to fit the least-squares regression line with an intercept of 0 to obtain the estimated slope and its standard error and evaluate both of the proposed formulas for constructing a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope. For the appropriate method, about 95 percent of the simulated confidence intervals should contain 1.3966, the slope of the “true” line used to simulate the data sets.</p><p></p><p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p><p>There are six parts for this question. Parts (a) and (b) are scored together as a single score—essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect. Parts (c) and (d) are scored together as a single score—also as essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect. Part (e) is scored as essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect. Part (f) is scored as essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect. Each essentially correct response in each part is worth 1 point, each partially correct response is worth ½ point, and each incorrect response is worth 0 points.</p><p></p><p>Note: If the total score earned for the four parts is not a whole number of points (i.e., 3½ points, 2½ points, 1½ points, or ½ point), then the quality of the overall work in all four parts collectively needs to be evaluated. If the overall quality warrants, the total score should be moved up ½ point to the next higher whole number score; if that is unwarranted, then the total score should be moved down ½ point to the next lower whole number score. The general student performance expectations found in the <em>AP Statistics Course Description </em>are helpful in making this judgment.
