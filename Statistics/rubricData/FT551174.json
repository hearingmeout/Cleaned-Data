The range and interquartile range of the salaries are greater for Corporation A than for Corporation B. The two highest salaries at Corporation A are outliers while Corporation B has no outliers.</p><p><strong>Part (b)</strong>:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><li><p>Five years after starting, at least 3 out of 30 (10%) of the salaries at Corporation A are greater than the maximum salary at Corporation B. If I accept the offer from Corporation A, I might be able to make a higher salary at Corporation A than at Corporation B.</p></li><li><p>Five years after starting, the minimum salary at Corporation B is greater than at Corporation A. In fact, at Corporation A it looks like some people are still making the starting salary of $36,000 and never received a raise in the five years since they were hired. So if I work at Corporation A, I might never receive a raise in salary.</p></li></ol><p></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>Parts (a) and (b) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows: </p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following four components:</p><ol><li><p>A correct comparison of center.</p></li><li><p>A correct comparison of spread.</p></li><li><p>A discussion of the outliers for Corporation A.</p></li><li><p>The response is in context.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only three of the four components.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response includes at most two of the four components.</p><p>Note: Any mention of shape should be ignored because complete shape information cannot be determined from a boxplot.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following four components:</p><ol><li><p>In part (b-i) a relevant statistical measure is identified (or described) or a relevant statistical comparison is provided that supports the choice of Corporation A.</p></li><li><p>In part (b-i) an explanation is provided for why the measure or comparison is relevant.</p></li><li><p>In part (b-ii) a relevant statistical measure is identified (or described) or a relevant statistical comparison is provided that supports the choice of Corporation B.</p></li><li><p>In part (b-ii) an explanation is provided for why the measure or comparison is relevant.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only two or three of the four components.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response includes none or one of the four components.</p><p><em>Note: </em>If a response does not provide a statistical measure or comparison in part (b-i) or (b-ii), the second and fourth components can still be satisfied if an acceptable explanation is provided that would follow from a relevant statistical measure or comparison.
