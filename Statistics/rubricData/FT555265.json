The difference between these two residual averages is 18.6 − (−8.8) = 27.4 thousand dollars. This suggests that, for two houses of the same size, the house with a swimming pool would be estimated to cost $27,400 more than the house with no swimming pool.</p><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><p>No, this confidence interval does not indicate a significant difference (at the 95 percent confidence level, equivalent to the 5 percent significance level) between the two slope coefficients because the interval includes the value zero.</p><p><strong>Part (e):</strong></p><p>If the two population regression lines do in fact have the same slope, the impact of a swimming pool is the (constant) vertical distance between the two lines. However, because the two fitted lines do not have the same slope, the distance between the two fitted lines depends on the size of the house. Using the available information, there are two acceptable approaches to estimating the impact of having a swimming pool.</p><p><strong>Approach 1:</strong> Use the two fitted lines to predict the price of a house with and without a pool for a particular house size. For example, using the value of size = 2,250 square feet (which is near the middle of the distribution of house sizes), we find:</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with a swimming pool =<br><strong>−11.602 + 0.166 × 2,250 = 361.898</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with no swimming pool =<br><strong>−27.382 + 0.160 × 2,250 = 332.618</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p>The difference in these predicted prices is <strong>361.898 − 332.618 = 29.280</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a 2,250 square-foot house. This is quite similar to the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Approach 2:</strong> Because the slopes of the two sample regression lines were judged not to be significantly different, another acceptable approach would be to use the difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines as an estimate of the vertical distance between the two population regression lines.</p><p>The difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines is <strong>−11.602 − (−27.382) = 15.780</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a house, assuming this difference does not change with the size of the house. This is quite different from the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections. Section 1 consists of part (a); section 2 consists of part (b); section 3 consists of part (c); section 4 consists of parts (d) and (e). Each of the four sections is scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P) or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Section 1</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response identifies the correct value for the slope coefficient and provides a correct interpretation in context.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response identifies the correct value for the slope coefficient and provides a correct interpretation but not in context <em>OR</em> the response provides an incorrect value for the slope but provides a correct interpretation of this value in context <em>OR</em> the response identifies the correct value for the slope but the interpretation is incomplete because of one or more of the following errors:</p><p>The interpretation does not mention “predicted” or “on average” or any other indication of a probabilistic rather than a deterministic relationship.</p><p>The interpretation does not include the notion of each additional square foot of size by saying something like “for every square foot.”</p><p>The interpretation does not use units for the price variable, or it uses incorrect units for the price variable (e.g., dollars instead of thousands of dollars).</p><p>Incorrect (I) if there is no interpretation or if the interpretation does not warrant a score of P.</p><p><em>Note:</em> It is possible to earn an E for section 1 without stating the actual numerical value of the slope, if a correct and well-communicated interpretation of the slope is given in context.</p><p><strong>Section 2</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides a correct interpretation of the residual value, in context, including both direction and a comparison with the model’s predicted or average value (e.g., actual price is higher than predicted).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides an interpretation of the residual value that fails to mention direction or that gives the incorrect direction <em>OR</em> if the response provides a correct interpretation of the residual value that includes direction, but that is not in context.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if there is no interpretation of the residual value <em>OR</em> the interpretation does not include direction and is not in context.</p><p><strong>Section 3</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly calculates averages of residual values both for houses with pools and houses without pools AND correctly reports the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response either correctly calculates averages of residual values both for houses with pools and houses without pools but does not correctly report the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool <em>OR</em> incorrectly calculates one or both averages of residual values but does report the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool <em>OR</em> does not use all of the residual values but does use a reasonable set of residual values (such as houses of similar size) and correctly calculates both averages and correctly reports the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for an E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><p>If the student calculates some other measure of center for the two sets of residuals (e.g., medians) and reports the difference as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool, this part can be scored, at best, partially correct (P).</p><p>If the student estimates the values of the residuals from the residual plot rather than using the residuals provided in the table, the response can be scored as essentially correct (E), provided it is clear that this is what was done.</p><p><strong>Section 4</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes all three of the following components:</p><p>Correctly notes that the confidence interval in part (d) includes zero and so the difference in the slopes is not statistically significant.</p><p>Calculates a reasonable estimate in part (e):</p><p>For approach 1, this includes choosing a house size within the range of the data and correctly computing the difference in predicted prices.</p><p>For approach 2, this includes appealing to the fact that the slopes were judged as not significantly different and computing the difference in intercepts.</p><p>Includes a comparison of the estimate in part (e) to the estimate in part (c).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only one of (1) and (2) above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response includes neither (1) nor (2) above.</p><p><em>Notes</em></p><p>If the response uses approach 1, the difference between the two predicted values can range from 25.38 to 33.44, depending on the house size used.</p><p>If the response uses approach 2, the constant vertical distance can be estimated from the graph showing the two regression lines rather than on the difference in intercepts, provided that the response makes it clear that this is what is being done.</p><p>In the comparison with the estimate in part (c), an assessment of the size of the difference in estimates is not required. Statements that merely use phrases like “greater than,” “about the same,” etc. are acceptable for the comparison component of parts (d) and (e).</p><p>If this section receives a score of partially correct only because the student neglects to compare the estimate in part (e) to the estimate in part (c), the response should be scored up if a decision on whether to score up or down is required.</p><p>If the response subtracts the two fitted equations to obtain a general expression for the vertical distance between the two fitted lines as a function of house size, this should be considered an essentially correct approach for component 2 of section 4. The resulting expression is <strong>15.580 + 0.006 • (size)</strong> .</p><p>If the student uses a house size outside the range of the data to compute the difference in predicted price, this can only be considered correct if the student appeals to the fact that the slopes of the sample regression lines are not significantly different.</p><p>Each essentially correct (E) section counts as 1 point. Each partially correct (P) section counts as ½ point.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><p>If a response is between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to determine whether to score up or down, depending on the overall strength of the response and communication.

For example, using the value of size = 2,250 square feet (which is near the middle of the distribution of house sizes), we find:</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with a swimming pool =<br><strong>−11.602 + 0.166 × 2,250 = 361.898</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with no swimming pool =<br><strong>−27.382 + 0.160 × 2,250 = 332.618</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p><br>The difference in these predicted prices is <strong>361.898 − 332.618 = 29.280</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a 2,250 square-foot house. This is quite similar to the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Approach 2:</strong> Because the slopes of the two sample regression lines were judged not to be significantly different, another acceptable approach would be to use the difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines as an estimate of the vertical distance between the two population regression lines.</p><p>The difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines is <strong>−11.602 − (−27.382) = 15.780</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a house, assuming this difference does not change with the size of the house. This is quite different from the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections.

the incorrect direction <em>OR</em> if the response provides a correct interpretation of the residual value that includes direction, but that is not in context.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if there is no

difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool <em>OR</em> does not use all of the residual values but does use a reasonable set of residual values (such as houses of similar size) and correctly calculates both averages and correctly reports the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for an E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><p>If the student calculates some other measure of center for the two sets of residuals (e.g., medians) and reports the

rather than using the residuals provided in the table, the response can be scored as essentially correct (E), provided it is clear that this is what was done.</p><p><strong>Section 4</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes all three of the following components:</p><p>Correctly notes that the confidence interval in part (d) includes zero and so the difference in the slopes is not statistically significant.</p><p>Calculates a reasonable estimate in part (e):</p><p>For approach 1, this includes choosing a house size within the range of the data

than on the difference in intercepts, provided that the response makes it clear that this is what is being done.</p><p>In the comparison with the estimate in part (c), an assessment of the size of the difference in estimates is not required.

More specific goals were to assess students’ ability to (1) interpret a slope coefficient and residual value; (2) interpret a confidence interval; (3) compare two regression models and draw appropriate conclusions.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><strong>Part (a):</strong></p><p>The slope coefficient is 0.165. This means that for each additional square foot of size, the predicted price of the house increases by 0.165 thousand dollars, which is $165. In other words, this model predicts that the average price of a house increases by $165 for each additional square foot of a house’s size.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The residual value of 49 for this house indicates that its actual price is 49 thousand dollars higher than the model would predict for a house of its size.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>The average residual value for the eight houses with a swimming pool is:<br><math aria-label=\"Start fraction left parenthesis 6 plus 49 plus left parenthesis negative 18 right parenthesis plus 42 plus 1 plus 50 plus 9 plus left parenthesis negative 23 right parenthesis plus 42 right parenthesis over 8 end fraction equals start fraction 149 over 8 end fraction equals 18.6.\">\n <mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <mrow><mo>(</mo>\n    <mrow>\n     <mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>49</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>18</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>42</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>50</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>23</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>42</mn></mrow>\n   <mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext></mrow>\n  <mn>8</mn>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>=</mo><mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <mn>149</mn></mrow>\n  <mn>8</mn>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>=</mo><mn>18.6</mn>\n</math> <br>The average residual value for the 17 houses with no swimming pool is:</p><p><math aria-label=\"Start fraction 13 plus 26 plus left parenthesis 45 right parenthesis plus dot dot dot plus left parenthesis negative 58 right parenthesis plus left parenthesis negative 52 right parenthesis plus 33 right parenthesis over 17 end fraction equals start fraction negative 150 over 17 end fraction equals negative 8.8.\">\n <mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <mrow><mo>(</mo>\n    <mrow>\n     <mn>13</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>26</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>45</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>...</mn><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>58</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>52</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>33</mn></mrow>\n   <mo>)</mo></mrow><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext></mrow>\n  <mrow>\n   <mn>17</mn></mrow>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>=</mo><mfrac>\n  <mrow>\n   <mo>−</mo><mn>150</mn></mrow>\n  <mrow>\n   <mn>17</mn></mrow>\n </mfrac>\n <mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>8.8</mn>\n</math></p><p>The residual averages suggest that the regression line tends to underestimate the price of homes with a swimming pool by about 18.6 thousand dollars and to overestimate the price of homes with no pool by about 8.8 thousand dollars. The difference between these two residual averages is 18.6 − (−8.8) = 27.4 thousand dollars. This suggests that, for two houses of the same size, the house with a swimming pool would be estimated to cost $27,400 more than the house with no swimming pool.</p><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><p>No, this confidence interval does not indicate a significant difference (at the 95 percent confidence level, equivalent to the 5 percent significance level) between the two slope coefficients because the interval includes the value zero.</p><p><strong>Part (e):</strong></p><p>If the two population regression lines do in fact have the same slope, the impact of a swimming pool is the (constant) vertical distance between the two lines. However, because the two fitted lines do not have the same slope, the distance between the two fitted lines depends on the size of the house. Using the available information, there are two acceptable approaches to estimating the impact of having a swimming pool.</p><p><strong>Approach 1:</strong> Use the two fitted lines to predict the price of a house with and without a pool for a particular house size. For example, using the value of size = 2,250 square feet (which is near the middle of the distribution of house sizes), we find:</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with a swimming pool =<br><strong>−11.602 + 0.166 × 2,250 = 361.898</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p>Predicted price for a 2,250 square-foot house with no swimming pool =<br><strong>−27.382 + 0.160 × 2,250 = 332.618</strong> thousand dollars.</p><p>The difference in these predicted prices is <strong>361.898 − 332.618 = 29.280</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a 2,250 square-foot house. This is quite similar to the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Approach 2:</strong> Because the slopes of the two sample regression lines were judged not to be significantly different, another acceptable approach would be to use the difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines as an estimate of the vertical distance between the two population regression lines.</p><p>The difference in the intercepts of the two fitted lines is <strong>−11.602 − (−27.382) = 15.780</strong> thousand dollars, which is an estimate of the impact of a swimming pool on the predicted price of a house, assuming this difference does not change with the size of the house. This is quite different from the estimate based on residuals in part (c).</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections. Section 1 consists of part (a); section 2 consists of part (b); section 3 consists of part (c); section 4 consists of parts (d) and (e). Each of the four sections is scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P) or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Section 1</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response identifies the correct value for the slope coefficient and provides a correct interpretation in context.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response identifies the correct value for the slope coefficient and provides a correct interpretation but not in context <em>OR</em> the response provides an incorrect value for the slope but provides a correct interpretation of this value in context <em>OR</em> the response identifies the correct value for the slope but the interpretation is incomplete because of one or more of the following errors:</p><p>The interpretation does not mention “predicted” or “on average” or any other indication of a probabilistic rather than a deterministic relationship.</p><p>The interpretation does not include the notion of each additional square foot of size by saying something like “for every square foot.”</p><p>The interpretation does not use units for the price variable, or it uses incorrect units for the price variable (e.g., dollars instead of thousands of dollars).</p><p>Incorrect (I) if there is no interpretation or if the interpretation does not warrant a score of P.</p><p><em>Note:</em> It is possible to earn an E for section 1 without stating the actual numerical value of the slope, if a correct and well-communicated interpretation of the slope is given in context.</p><p><strong>Section 2</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides a correct interpretation of the residual value, in context, including both direction and a comparison with the model’s predicted or average value (e.g., actual price is higher than predicted).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides an interpretation of the residual value that fails to mention direction or that gives the incorrect direction <em>OR</em> if the response provides a correct interpretation of the residual value that includes direction, but that is not in context.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if there is no interpretation of the residual value <em>OR</em> the interpretation does not include direction and is not in context.</p><p><strong>Section 3</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly calculates averages of residual values both for houses with pools and houses without pools AND correctly reports the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response either correctly calculates averages of residual values both for houses with pools and houses without pools but does not correctly report the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool <em>OR</em> incorrectly calculates one or both averages of residual values but does report the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool <em>OR</em> does not use all of the residual values but does use a reasonable set of residual values (such as houses of similar size) and correctly calculates both averages and correctly reports the difference between those averages as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for an E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><p>If the student calculates some other measure of center for the two sets of residuals (e.g., medians) and reports the difference as the estimate of the impact of a swimming pool, this part can be scored, at best, partially correct (P).</p><p>If the student estimates the values of the residuals from the residual plot rather than using the residuals provided in the table, the response can be scored as essentially correct (E), provided it is clear that this is what was done.</p><p><strong>Section 4</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes all three of the following components:</p><p>Correctly notes that the confidence interval in part (d) includes zero and so the difference in the slopes is not statistically significant.</p><p>Calculates a reasonable estimate in part (e):</p><p>For approach 1, this includes choosing a house size within the range of the data
