Because the observed ratio is unlikely to occur by random sampling alone when the population standard deviations are equal, we have fairly strong evidence that the generic blades (G) really do have more variability in the number of shaves than the name brand blades (B).</p><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections. Section 1 consists of parts (a) and (b); section 2 consists of part (c); section 3 consists of part (d); and section 4 consists of part (e). Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p></p><p><strong>Section 1 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response constructs the back-to-back stemplot correctly AND correctly <em>compares </em>the two distributions on all three characteristics (center, spread, shape).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response:</p><ul><li><p>Correctly constructs the graph AND</p><ul><li><p>Correctly compares one or two of the three characteristics;<br><em>OR</em></p></li><li><p>Discusses all three characteristics without comparison.</p></li></ul><p><em>OR</em></p></li><li><p>Incorrectly constructs the graph AND correctly compares all three characteristics.</p></li></ul><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Section 2 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides a correct conclusion in context with justification based on linkage to the <em>p</em>-value.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response provides a correct conclusion in context, but no justification based on linkage to the <em>p</em>-value;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response provides a correct conclusion with justification based on linkage to the <em>p</em>-value, but no context.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes</em>:</p><ul><li><p>If the correct conclusion for the reported <em>p</em>-value is to fail to reject the null hypothesis, then a conclusion that is equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis, either as a stated decision or as a conclusion in context, cannot be scored as E (for example, “Name brand blades last the same length of time as the generic blades.”) Such a response is scored P provided that the conclusion is in context with linkage. If such a response lacks either context or linkage, it is scored I.</p></li><li><p>If the correct conclusion for the reported <em>p</em>-value is to fail to reject, but the response says to “retain the null hypothesis” with linkage and context, the response is scored P. However, if the response goes on to say something equivalent to “fail to reject” in context, the response is scored E.</p></li><li><p>If both a significance level 𝛼 and a <em>p</em>-value are given together, the linkage between the <em>p</em>-value and the conclusion is implied. If no significance level is given, the solution must be explicit about the linkage by giving a correct interpretation of the <em>p</em>-value or explaining how the conclusion follows from the <em>p</em>-value, such as “Because the <em>p</em>-value is large, we do not reject the null hypothesis.”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Section 3 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly states that the population standard deviations are equal if the null hypothesis is true, so the (simulated) sample standard deviations should produce ratios centered around 1.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response does not appeal to the equality of the population standard deviations under the null hypothesis but makes the connection to the simulated ratios being centered around 1;<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response appeals to the equality of the population standard deviations under the null hypothesis, but does not make the connection that the simulated sample standard deviations should produce ratios centered around 1.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Section 4 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response draws an appropriate conclusion with a well-explained justification based on the results of the simulation.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response draws an appropriate conclusion based on the results of the simulation, but with a weak or poorly communicated justification.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Each essentially correct (E) section counts as 1 point. Each partially correct (P) section counts as ½ point. If a response is between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to decide whether to score up or down, depending on the overall strength of the response and communication.</p><blockquote><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p></blockquote>"]}]
