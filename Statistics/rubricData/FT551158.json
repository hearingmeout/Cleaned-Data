If the student goes on to say something equivalent to “fail to reject” (e.g., “we should not conclude the mean length of fish is greater at Fish Friends”) in context, with linkage, then the response should be scored essentially correct.</p><p>A conclusion in step 4 that is equivalent to “accept H0 ” (such as “we conclude that the mean fish length is the same from both suppliers”) cannot be scored essentially correct. Such a response should be scored partially correct, provided that the conclusion is in context, with justification based on linkage to the <em>p</em>-value. Such a response should be scored incorrect if it lacks either context or linkage to the <em>p</em>-value.</p><p>If a student attempts to interpret the <em>p</em>-value, but does so incorrectly, then do not give credit for the linkage component.<br></p><p>Each essentially correct (E) step counts as 1 point. Each partially correct (P) step counts as ½ point.

More specific goals were to assess students’ ability to (1) state appropriate hypotheses; (2) identify the name of an appropriate statistical test and check appropriate assumptions/conditions; (3) compute the appropriate test statistic and p-value; (4) draw an appropriate conclusion, with justification, in the context of the study.</p><p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p><p>Step 1: States a correct pair of hypotheses</p><p>Let <em>μB</em> represent the population mean length of all adult fish of this species from Buy-Rite Pets, <br>and <br>let <em>μF</em> represent the population mean length of all adult fish of this species from Fish Friends.</p><p>The hypotheses to be tested are H0: <em>μB</em> = <em>μF</em> versus Ha: <em>μB</em> &lt; <em>μF</em>.</p><p>Step 2: Identifies a correct test procedure (by name or by formula) and checks appropriate conditions</p><p>The appropriate test is a two-sample <em>t</em>-test. The first condition is that the samples are independent random samples from the two populations. This was stated in the question. The second condition is that the population distributions of fish lengths are normal. The following dotplots reveal no obvious departures from normality, so it appears reasonable to proceed with the two-sample <em>t</em>-test.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/6c63c20bc1009f7436a40cf2f1b65662/original.png?Signature=rU2rzDo%2Fi%2FKimi%2BbQfoL8UuAdtc%3D&amp;Expires=1628263226&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUDBDLUZK3453OUI6&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjED8aCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIFYwBKLR2jwytYQMCmM6ecF2i%2BA7iEInm67ka4AL5irLAiEA0yWdcM3nWN3XF5dhgkjOX%2BSvOht6Y%2BVJqTUriuOyXHcq%2BgMIWBACGgwyODEzOTQ1MjE2ODUiDMGO3EgjE1UU8a348CrXAyBVjdwS1SVZxdCsNarebCJ5ToJZ3N2dkA8W7MTVQRVSr6ADWibgNvHw5N5Znle4SaMBihOgh3i8Un1kbxo%2Bkf0n%2BvkaEMasU%2BWF1PCqpfEnnCyzNe9ydQs5qEPXLYit6Nl%2BCEnWyUwGFUCU%2B2kyvFuX3HYdcsJABn/kDhm/fEJpFw%2B5clgRxwtXjA4TI8knQDoXRCz6UmQUMGGQRMqt89%2BxV%2BNveg1ZsigdKOHxPbdAjSj1/0sgyFoXTytVsN7fDhDoDi9LeAag9dRJGgDNvAvgwjT8sCLcwx1qdDzWMM6e3k18PyVHKa75sVVGTwzk/iMS22g5CQmHX23G9g9qT6eKMj7ss%2BOqDrzqUAqu0fyMJL2t/N3Wepwgqrr7DCqegKuJpblUNCcoWSDcjlHCJAtnENZSBKEAI/hYsVZ4H8p/g0JoyqucxSUIxKPUDX2YsRcW7m39SXc1dEpIzq99iliJAAfIYZh/zj1Fmun8aHVRKjvI52QhecGvklTYdR/jnuuYEFk/Tr3DrnQbKglQj6OqPJSsDwLgqmqQy67%2Bq/NAUWbCeaGnUvVrJHB4N%2BU1UwleqD2U6rR/Vgjrw%2BALN7F88kKb8BL6qx/NI6/gtvEGNKVus9uITTCsr7OIBjqlAap1lvvEjCpZxG8M5yDFfdsblpsOcbXkBNQCHzCunMO67p0WNTs7GUB1BdcFoopsOsM6gKqzXzePSRMTiw1aY3Whsmz%2B/J9h63ki3So/yEGNlNWu5XtXLWjOO8ZH/CtS%2B8y6jIFyMB20ymuXmwMkT7aHmlW9i1yKQM2xtSJ9VGFHwMTdwLO7vJfy65m1iYDNm9eXXUd2M%2BX3ovNIjIPc2hHaP/PPyA%3D%3D\" alt=\"The horizontal axis labeled Length (inches) ranges from 2.6 to 4.4 in increments of 0.2.
