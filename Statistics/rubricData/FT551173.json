The residual value means that the car’s FCR is 0.96 gallons per 100 miles greater than would be predicted for a car of its length.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\"><li><p>The point with a wheel base of 93 inches and a residual of 0.96 gallons per 100 miles is circled in graph III below.<br><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/0bb782728fa3460334d8b64cd9920f87/original.png\" alt=\"A scatter plot is shown with the title Graph 3. The vertical axis shows residuals from regression of F C R on Length from negative 2 to 2.5 in increments of 0.5 and the horizontal axis shows wheel base in inches from 85 to 130 in increments of 5. A horizontal line is plotted across the graph at 0. Sixty six points are plotted and they are concentrated in the center of the graph around 110 inches at 0, with some spread out from there mostly toward the upper and left edges of the graph. A point at approximately 120 and 0 is labeled B, and a point at approximately 95 and 1 is circled.\"></p></li><li><p>Point B corresponds to a car with an actual FCR that is very close to the FCR that would be predicted for a car with its length by the regression model which predicts FCR using the explanatory variable length.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><blockquote><p>Graph II reveals a moderate association that is positive and linear. In contrast, there is a weak association that is positive and linear in graph III. The association between engine size and residual (from predicting FCR based on length) is stronger than the association between wheel base and residual (from predicting FCR based on length).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><blockquote><p>Engine size is a better choice than wheel base for including with length in a regression model for predicting FCR. The stronger association between engine size and residual (from predicting FCR based on length) indicates that engine size is more useful than wheel base for reducing the variability in FCR values that remains unexplained (as indicated by residuals) after predicting FCR based on length.</p></blockquote><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) were scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides the following two components:</p><ol><li><p>A correct residual value with supporting calculation.</p></li><li><p>A correct interpretation of the residual value, in context.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response includes only one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>If the residual value is incorrect, the interpretation should be considered correct if it follows from the incorrect residual value.</p></li><li><p>Correct interpretation of the residual must include the correct direction and magnitude of the FCR value away from the predicted FCR value.</p></li><li><p>A calculated residual value which is slightly different from 0.96 due to the number of significant digits is acceptable.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response provides the following two components:</p><ol><li><p>Circles the correct point in graph III.</p></li><li><p>Provides a reasonable interpretation of the car associated with point B having a residual near 0 that refers to predicting FCR based on length.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly provides only one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Note: </em>A correct response for the second component must include reference to the observed FCR value of the car represented by point B, not the point B itself.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly provides the following three components:</p><ol><li><p>A description of form AND direction for both graphs.</p></li><li><p>A description of the strength of association for both graphs.</p></li><li><p>A comparison between the two graphs.</p></li></ol><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly provides only two of the three components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ul><li><p>Part (c) is focused on the comparison of graph II and graph III.
