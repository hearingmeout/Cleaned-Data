The vertical axis have markings from 0, 1, and 2. Points are marked corresponding to each year which is indicated by 'plus' and 'degree' signs. Both the signs make two different curves.  The points marked by the degree sign make almost a straight curve. For the year 1988, it is marked at 0.3, for 1990, it is marked at 0.5, for 1992 it is marked at 1, 1994 is marked at 1.3, for year 1996 the point is marked at 1.8.  For another curve marked by the plus sign, two peaks are obtained at year 1990 and 1994 which are marked at 0.2 and 0.3 respectively. The overall shape of curve made by plus sign is concave down till point (1992 comma 0.2) and then it makes a new concave down curve from (1992 comma 0.2) (1996 comma 0.3).
