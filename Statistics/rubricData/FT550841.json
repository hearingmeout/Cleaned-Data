Because this is an observational study and not an experiment, no cause-and-effect relationship between meditation and lower blood pressure can be inferred. It is quite possible that men who choose to meditate could differ from men who do not choose to meditate in other ways that were also associated with blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The sample sizes were too small, relative to the overall sample proportion of successes, to justify using a normal approximation.

The graph of simulation results reveals that a difference of –0.47 or more extreme was very rare. In fact, the value –0.47 was the smallest possible outcome and occurred in only 76 of the 10,000 repetitions in the simulation. Thus, assuming that all men in the retirement community were equally likely to have high blood pressure whether they meditate or not, there is an approximate probability of 0.0076 of getting a difference of −0.47 or smaller by chance alone. Because this approximate p-value is very small, there is convincing evidence that men in this retirement community who meditate were less likely to have high blood pressure than men in this retirement community who do not meditate. However, because this is an observational study, even though we can conclude that meditation is associated with a lower chance of having high blood pressure, we cannot conclude that meditation causes a reduction in the likeliness of having high blood pressure.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b), and (c) were scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly claims that a cause-and-effect conclusion cannot be justified <em>AND</em></p><ul><li><p>Provides an explanation based on the study design (for example, noting that this study was not an experiment, or was just an observational study, or that treatments weren’t randomly assigned, or that no variables were controlled)<br><em>OR</em></p></li><li><p>Provides a complete explanation of confounding in the context of this question by describing that men who choose to meditate could differ from men who do not choose to meditate in other ways that were also associated with blood pressure.</p></li></ul><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly claims that a cause-and-effect conclusion cannot be justified <em>AND</em> provides a weak or incomplete explanation (for example, only citing that association is not causation, only noting that there could be confounding/lurking variables, or only stating that other variables such as diet might affect blood pressure).</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response claims that a cause-and-effect conclusion can be drawn <em>OR</em> answers that no cause-and-effect conclusion can be drawn but provides an incorrect explanation or does not provide an explanation (for example, only saying “We cannot conclude causation, we can only conclude association” without providing a reason).</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><li><p>A response that says a cause-and-effect conclusion cannot be justified and provides a correct explanation based on the study design (bullet 1) and also mentions confounding/lurking variables without a complete explanation of confounding is scored essentially correct.</p></li><li><p>A response that provides an additional incorrect explanation (for example, that the sample size is too small, or that the conditions for inference weren’t met, or that n &lt; 30), lowers the score one level (that is, from E to P, or from P to I) in part (a).</p></li><li><p>A response that makes an incorrect claim about a significance test (for example, “we cannot conclude cause-and-effect from a significance test” or “significance tests can only show association”) lowers the score one level (that is, from E to P, or from P to I) in part (a).
