Each treatment combination will be randomly assigned to 2 of the 12 tanks. One way to do this is to generate a random number for each tank. The treatment combinations are then assigned by sorting the random numbers from smallest to largest.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.academicmerit.com/b254c6a07d25eec2dd6d23c61f5d831e/original.png\" alt=\"A table is shown with four columns.

By eliminating this possible source of variation, type of shrimp, we are better able to isolate the variability due to the factors of interest to us (nutrient and salinity level). This will make it easier to identify any treatment effects that may be present.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><blockquote><p>Using only tiger shrimp will limit the scope of inference for the biologist. Ideally, the biologist would like to identify the treatment combination that leads to the most growth for all shrimp. However, the biologist will only be able to identify the best treatment combination for tiger shrimp because other types of shrimp may respond differently to the treatments.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Part (a) is scored as essentially correct (E) or incorrect (I).
