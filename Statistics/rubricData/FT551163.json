The horizontal axis is labeled from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1. Male and female are labeled on the vertical axis and at each label there is a horizontal bar reaching from the vertical axis to 1, and the bar is divided into three parts by two vertical lines with the left section representing party W, the middle section representing party X, and the right section representing party Y. The female and male bars both have the first vertical line at about 0.17 and the second at about 0.66.\" title=\"\"></p><p></p><p><strong>SCORING</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b) and (c) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P) or incorrect (I).</p><p><strong>Part (a)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response has the correct conditional probability <em>AND</em> shows the work.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response has the correct reverse conditional probability (of being a male given that he is registered for Party Y),<br><em>OR</em><br>if the response has the correct conditional probability BUT does not show work.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response fails to meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><strong>Part (b)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response identifies two values whose inequality implies a lack of independence between the events <em>AND</em> includes the following three components:</p><p>Correct computations of the two values.</p><p>An explicit statement of whether the two values are equal or unequal.</p><p>An appropriate conclusion about the independence of the events.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response identifies two values whose inequality implies a lack of independence between the events but includes only two of the three components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response fails to meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><strong>Part (c)</strong> is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response shows the same conditional distribution of party registration for both males and females <em>AND</em> includes the following two components:</p><p>Correct proportions for each party.</p><p>Correct labels (Party W, Party X, Party Y).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response shows the same conditional distribution of party registration for both males and females <em>AND</em> includes only one of the two components listed above.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response fails to meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p><em>Note: </em>For all three parts, an incorrect statement that indicate a serious misunderstanding of statistical concepts, even if unrelated to the rest of the response, lowers the score one level (that is, from E to P, or from P to I).
