Mechanics are correct.</p><p>A discussion of conditions for inference should generally be treated as extraneous. However, if the response includes inappropriate conditions—like normality or independent samples—the response cannot receive a score of 4.</p><p>An inappropriate method of calculating df will result in these combined steps being scored incorrect.</p><p><strong>Section 3</strong> [part (a), step 4]: States a correct conclusion in the context of the problem.</p><p>If an incorrect <em>p</em>-value in steps 2 and 3 is obtained from a chi-square goodness-of-fit test, but the conclusion is consistent with this <em>p</em>-value, step 4 can be considered correct.</p><p>If both an <em>α</em> and a <em>p</em>-value are given together, the linkage between the <em>p</em>-value and the conclusion is implied. If no <em>α</em> is given, the solution must be explicit about the linkage by giving a correct interpretation of the <em>p</em>-value <em>OR</em> explaining how the conclusion follows from the <em>p</em>-value.</p><p><strong>Section 4</strong> [part (b)] is scored as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Essentially correct (E) if habitat types 2 and 3 are identified as the preferred habitat types with a justification that indicates there is a higher proportion (or a higher number) of moose than expected relative to the proportion of total acreage in those areas. One way to do this is to compare the observed density of moose across the four habitat types. Note that habitat types 2 and 3 also happen to make the largest contribution to the chi-square statistic.</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>Habitat type 3 is identified as the most preferred because it has a higher proportion (or higher number) of moose than expected and the largest chi-square contribution <em>OR</em> the largest positive difference in observed and expected proportions <em>OR</em> the highest density of moose.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if habitat types 2 and 3 (or habitat type 3 alone) are identified with an incomplete justification. For example, a student might select habitat type 3 as most preferred based on the fact that it yields the largest contribution to the chi-square statistic but not indicate that there is a higher proportion (or higher number) of moose than expected in these areas.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if habitat types 2 and 3 (or just habitat type 3) are identified with no or incorrect justification <em>OR</em> habitat types 1 or 4 are identified.</p></blockquote><p>Each essentially correct (E) response counts as 1 point, and a partially correct (P) response in part (b) counts as ½ point. If a response is between two scores (for example, 2½ points), use a holistic approach to determine whether to score up or down, depending on the strength of the response and communication.</p><blockquote><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p></blockquote>"]}]
