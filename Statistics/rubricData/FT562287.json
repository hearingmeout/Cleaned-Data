The median age group corresponds to the bar such that at least 50% of the population is in that age group or higher, and at least 50% of the population is in that age group or lower. Adding the lengths of the bars either above or below the 30 to 39 age group shows that this group satisfies the condition.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>Parts (a), (b) and (c) are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p></p><p><strong>Part (a) is scored as follows:</strong></p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response:</p><p>(1) says no;</p><p>(2) justifies the choice by either estimating the sum of the lengths of the bars or by comparing their lengths in each of the relevant age groups for the two countries; and</p><p>(3) includes an explicit comparison between Countries A and B for the bar lengths, such as by noting that the sum of the bars for Country A is less than the sum for Country B.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response says no and justifies the choice by adding or discussing the lengths</p><p>of bars for age groups 60 and above in Country A or Country B, but does not explicitly compare them to</p><p>the equivalent measure for the other Country.
