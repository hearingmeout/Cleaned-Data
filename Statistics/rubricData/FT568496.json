Explains how the responses to the survey might differ from the truth about student recycling (for</p><p>example, “students might say yes when they actually don’t recycle,” “students lie and say yes,” “students</p><p>don’t recycle but lie to the teacher”).</p><p>3. Describes the effect of the bias on the point estimate (or the proportion, percentage, number of yes</p><p>responses in the sample) and doesn’t contradict the bias described.</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response satisfies only two of the three components.</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response satisfies at most one of the three components.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>To satisfy component 1 the response must provide a reason that is based on a bias created by the teacher asking students in person. For example, a response that addresses the wording of the question, voluntary response, or sampling variability does not satisfy component 1.</p><p>To satisfy component 2 the response needs to explicitly contrast what the students say with what they do.</p><p>Evidence used to address component 3 cannot also be used to address component 2. For example, a response that says “Students might lie, producing an estimate that is too high” addresses the effect of the bias on the point estimate but should not be combined with the statement about students lying to infer that students do not actually recycle. However, a response that says “Students may lie and say yes, producing an estimate that is too high” satisfies both components 2 and 3.</p><p>If the response is clearly about the population proportion and not about the point estimate, component 3 cannot be satisfied.</p><p>Statements such as “the interval will be too high” do not satisfy component 3 because they don’t specifically address the point estimate.</p><p>Part (c) is scored as follows:</p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response gives an answer of 150 in (c-i) and gives an answer of 0.58 (or equivalent) in (c-ii).</p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response gives an answer of 150 in (c-i) and gives an answer of 0.42 (or equivalent) in (c-ii);</p><p>OR</p><p>if the response does not give an answer of 150 in (c-i) but gives an answer of 0.58 (or equivalent) with supporting work in (c-ii).</p><p>Incorrect (I) if the response does not meet the criteria for E or P.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>In part (c-i) the answer must be a single number. Responses such as “at least 150” or “147–153” are incorrect. However, responses such as “about 150” or “ ≈ 150” are acceptable.</p><p>In part (c-ii) the proportion can be described verbally (e.g., “87 out of 150”).</p><p>In part (c-ii) if the response clearly indicates that 0.58 (or 0.42) is the population proportion, lower the overall score in part (c) by one level (that is, from E to P, or from P to I). Using probability notation such as P(yes) does not clearly indicate a population proportion.</p><p>In part (c-ii) if the response includes a point estimate of 0.58 or 0.42 but uses a confidence interval as the final answer, lower the overall score in part (c) by one level (that is, from E to P, or from P to I).</p><p>If the answer is incorrect in part (c-i) and the answer in part (c-ii) uses numerator = 87 and denominator = 300 – answer to (c-i), the response should be scored P.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p>Three parts essentially correct</p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part partially correct</p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p>Two parts essentially correct and no parts partially correct</p><p>OR</p><p>One part essentially correct and one or two parts partially correct</p><p>OR</p><p>Three parts partially correct</p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><p>One part essentially correct</p><p>OR</p><p>No parts essentially correct and one or two parts partially correct</p>","labels":["0 points","1 point","2 points","3 points","4 points"],"values":[0,1,2,3,4],"maxScores":[4,4,4,4,4],"descriptions":["<p><strong>Student response earns 0 of the following 4 points</strong></p><p><strong>Intent of Question</strong></p><p>The primary goals of this question were to assess a student’s ability to (1) calculate the sample size when given the endpoints of a confidence interval for a proportion; (2) explain how bias could be present in a particular survey method; and (3) estimate a proportion from sample data collected using a method designed to decrease bias.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong></p><p><strong>Part (a):</strong></p><p>Using the standard formula for a confidence interval for one proportion, the interval (0.584 to 0.816) is found as follows.</p><p><math aria-label=\"Line 1. p hat plus-minus z prime times square root of start fraction p hat left parenthesis 1 minus p hat right parenthesis over n end fraction end root, where p hat equals start fraction 0.584 plus 0.816 over 2 end fraction equals 0.7, the margin of error is 0.816 minus 0.7 equals 0.110, and z prime equals 1.96.
