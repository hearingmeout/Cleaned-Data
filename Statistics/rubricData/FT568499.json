The median teaching year for High School B is the 111th value in the ordered list of values. For High School A the median is in the interval that starts at 7 and ends just before 10, because there are only 94 data values below 7 and 106 data values of at least 7. Therefore the median cannot be less than 7. For High School B the median is in the interval that starts at 4 and ends just before 7 because there are more than half (113) of the data values less than 7. Therefore the median must be less than 7. So High School A must be the one with a median of 7, and High School B must be the one with a median of 6.</p><p>Another way to determine which school has the median of 7 is to notice that the distribution for High School B is highly skewed to the right, whereas the distribution for High School A is bimodal with a few possible outliers on the right. A distribution that is highly right-skewed is likely to have a substantially larger mean than median. The mean of both distributions is given as 8.2 years, so it makes sense that the highly right- skewed distribution (High School B) is the one with the bigger gap between the mean and median and, therefore, the one with the lower median of 6.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The mean for the original 200 teachers was given as 8.2 years, and the mean for the additional 18 teachers is 2.5 years.

The median teaching year for High School B is the 111th value in the ordered list of values. For High School A the median is in the interval that starts at 7 and ends just before 10, because there are only 94 data values below 7 and 106 data values of at least 7. Therefore the median cannot be less than 7. For High School B the median is in the interval that starts at 4 and ends just before 7 because there are more than half (113) of the data values less than 7. Therefore the median must be less than 7. So High School A must be the one with a median of 7, and High School B must be the one with a median of 6.</p><p>Another way to determine which school has the median of 7 is to notice that the distribution for High School B is highly skewed to the right, whereas the distribution for High School A is bimodal with a few possible outliers on the right. A distribution that is highly right-skewed is likely to have a substantially larger mean than median.
