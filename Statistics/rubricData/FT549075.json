Section 1 consists of part (a), component 1; section 2 consists of part (a), component 2; section 3 consists of part (a), component 3. Section 4 consists of part (b). Sections 1 and 2 are scored as essentially correct (E) or incorrect (I). Sections 3 and 4 are scored as essentially correct (E), partially correct (P), or incorrect (I).</p><p></p><p><strong>Section 1 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><p></p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly compares center (or location) for both distributions.</p><p></p><p>Incorrect (I) otherwise.</p><p></p><p><strong>Section 2 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><p></p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly compares variability for both distributions.</p><p></p><p>Incorrect (I) otherwise.</p><p></p><p><strong>Section 3 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><p></p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response includes context related to the variable of interest (household size) <em>AND </em>the response correctly identifies the shapes of both distributions.</p><p></p><p>Partially correct (P) if the response correctly identifies the shapes of both distributions <em>BUT </em>does <em>NOT </em>include context related to the variable of interest (household size),</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>if the response correctly identifies the shape of only one distribution <em>AND </em>includes context related to the variable of interest (household size).</p><p></p><p>Incorrect (I) otherwise.</p><p></p><p><strong>Section 4 </strong>is scored as follows:</p><p></p><p>Essentially correct (E) if the response correctly states and checks the following two conditions.</p><p>1.
