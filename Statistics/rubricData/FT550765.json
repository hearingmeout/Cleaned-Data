Consequence: A consequence would be that the machine would not be repaired even though it is malfunctioning, so the machine would continue to put fewer than 50 pennies in each roll.</p><p><strong>Part (b):</strong></p><p>The sampling distribution of the total weight W is approximately normal with mean 50 × 2.5 125 = grams and standard deviation √(50) x 0.04 = 0.2828 grams.</p><p><strong>Part (c):</strong></p><p>The z-score for a total weight of 124 grams is: <em>z </em>= (123 - 125) / 0.2828 = -3.54.</p><p>Therefore, using the rule given, the probability is 0.0002 that the inspector will conclude that the selected roll contains fewer than 50 pennies, when in fact the roll really does contain 50 pennies.</p><p><strong>Part (d):</strong></p><p>If the roll actually contains 49 pennies, then the sampling distribution of the total weight is approximately normal with mean 49 × 2.5 = 122.5 grams and standard deviation √(49) x 0.04 = 0.2800 grams. The inspector will conclude that the roll contains fewer than 50 pennies if the total weight is less than 124 grams. The z-score associated with this value, when the roll actually contains 49 pennies, is: <em>z </em>= (124 - 122.5) / 0.2800 = 5.36. Such an extremely large z-score reveals that it would be extremely likely for 49 randomly selected pennies to have a total weight less than 124 grams. Therefore, when the roll actually contains 49 pennies, it is extremely likely (probability very close to 1) that the inspector will correctly conclude that the roll contains fewer than 50 pennies.</p><p><strong>Part (e):</strong></p><p>The inspector’s rule is very effective for distinguishing a roll that contains 50 pennies from one that contains fewer than 50 pennies. Part (c) reveals that if the roll actually contains 50 pennies, the probability is only 0.0002 that the inspector will mistakenly conclude that the roll contains fewer than 50 pennies. Part (d) reveals that if the roll actually contains fewer than 50 pennies, then it is extremely likely that the inspector will correctly conclude that the roll contains fewer than 50 pennies. Therefore, whether the roll contains 50 pennies or fewer, the inspector’s rule is extremely likely to lead to the correct decision.</p><p></p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question was scored in four sections.
