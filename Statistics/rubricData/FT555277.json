With this in mind, the dashed lines in the plots above represent extreme cases for possible sample regression lines. From these plots, we can see that there is a wider range of possible slopes in the second plot (on the right) than in the first plot (on the left). Because of this, the variability in the sampling distribution of <em>b</em>, the estimator for the slope of the regression line, will be smaller for the first study plan (with four observations at 6 feet and four observations at 13 feet) than it would be for the second study plan (with four observations at 8 feet and four observations at 10 feet). Therefore, the first study plan (on the left) would provide a better estimator of the slope of the regression line than the second study plan (on the right).</p><p><strong>Part (f):</strong></p><p>To assess the linear relationship between width of the buffer strip and the amount of nitrogen removed from runoff water, more widths should be used. To detect a nonlinear relationship it would be best to use buffer widths that were spaced out over the entire range of interest. For example, if the range of interest is 6 to 13 feet, eight buffers with widths 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 feet could be used.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections.

With this in mind, the dashed lines in the plots above represent extreme cases for possible sample regression lines. From these plots, we can see that there is a wider range of possible slopes in the second plot (on the right) than in the first plot (on the left). Because of this, the variability in the sampling distribution of <em>b</em>, the estimator for the slope of the regression line, will be smaller for the first study plan (with four observations at 6 feet and four observations at 13 feet) than it would be for the second study plan (with four observations at 8 feet and four observations at 10 feet). Therefore, the first study plan (on the left) would provide a better estimator of the slope of the regression line than the second study plan (on the right).</p><p><strong>Part (f):</strong></p><p>To assess the linear relationship between width of the buffer strip and the amount of nitrogen removed from runoff water, more widths should be used. To detect a nonlinear relationship it would be best to use buffer widths that were spaced out over the entire range of interest. For example, if the range of interest is 6 to 13 feet, eight buffers with widths 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 feet could be used.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections.

With this in mind, the dashed lines in the plots above represent extreme cases for possible sample regression lines. From these plots, we can see that there is a wider range of possible slopes in the second plot (on the right) than in the first plot (on the left). Because of this, the variability in the sampling distribution of <em>b</em>, the estimator for the slope of the regression line, will be smaller for the first study plan (with four observations at 6 feet and four observations at 13 feet) than it would be for the second study plan (with four observations at 8 feet and four observations at 10 feet). Therefore, the first study plan (on the left) would provide a better estimator of the slope of the regression line than the second study plan (on the right).</p><p><strong>Part (f):</strong></p><p>To assess the linear relationship between width of the buffer strip and the amount of nitrogen removed from runoff water, more widths should be used. To detect a nonlinear relationship it would be best to use buffer widths that were spaced out over the entire range of interest. For example, if the range of interest is 6 to 13 feet, eight buffers with widths 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 feet could be used.</p><p><strong>Scoring</strong></p><p>This question is scored in four sections.
