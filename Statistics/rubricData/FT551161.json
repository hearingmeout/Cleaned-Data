For example, the following response is scored as essentially correct (E): “Players A and B are close in weight lifting, because the difference of 5 pounds is much less than 1 standard deviation (25 pounds), but much less close in running time because the difference is 0.15 seconds, which is exactly one standard deviation. Therefore, player A should be selected since he is considerably faster and almost as strong as player B.”</p><p>Component 3 is not satisfied by the statement, “Player A should be selected since the weights lifted are close and running times are less close,” because the adjusted scales are not mentioned. Such a statement could apply to the original data, where the values are on different scales.</p><p>The justification in component 3 must reference the adjusted scale for at least one variable <em>AND</em> at least be implied for the other variable.</p><p>Normal probability calculations can be used in establishing the numerical scale adjustments for component 2 and for justifying the selection of the players in component 3. However, this results in a lowering of scores (that is, from E to P or from P to I) unless the student has concluded in part (a) that it was reasonable to believe that the distribution of running times was approximately normal.</p><p>Conceptual miscalculation of <em>z</em>-scores or probabilities (for example, using the wrong mean, reversing the order of subtraction, or multiplying probabilities) results in the loss of credit for component 2, whereas minor arithmetic mistakes are overlooked.</p><p><strong>4 Complete Response</strong></p><p>All three parts essentially correct</p><p><strong>3 Substantial Response</strong></p><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part partially correct</p><p><strong>2 Developing Response</strong></p><p>Two parts essentially correct and one part incorrect</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>One part essentially correct and one or two parts partially correct</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>Three parts partially correct</p><p><strong>1 Minimal Response</strong></p><p>One part essentially correct and two parts incorrect</p><p><em>OR</em></p><p>Two parts partially correct and one part incorrect</p>"]}]
