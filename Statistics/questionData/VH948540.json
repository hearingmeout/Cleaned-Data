The researchers asked the people in the samples whether they had tried a new product. The difference between the sample proportions (B minus A) of people in the regions who indicated they had tried the new product was 0.15. Under the assumption that all conditions for inference were met, a hypothesis test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis being that the population proportion of B is greater than that of A.
