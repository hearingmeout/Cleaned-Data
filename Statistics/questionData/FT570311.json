During each session, a patient rested on an examining table in the doctor’s office while the magnets, embedded in soft pads, were strapped to the body at the site of pain. Sessions continued for several weeks, after which pain reduction was measured.</p>\n\n<p>A new study is being designed to investigate whether magnets also reduce pain in patients suffering from herniated disks in the lower back.
