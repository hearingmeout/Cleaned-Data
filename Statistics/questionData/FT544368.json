[{"id":"FT544368","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<p>Every Monday a local radio station gives coupons away to 50 people who correctly answer a question about a news fact from the previous day's newspaper. The coupons given away are numbered from 1 to 50, with the first person receiving coupon 1, the second person receiving coupon 2, and so on, until all 50 coupons are given away. On the following Saturday, the radio station randomly draws numbers from 1 to 50 and awards cash prizes to the holders of the coupons with these numbers. Numbers continue to be drawn without replacement until the total amount awarded first equals or exceeds $300. If selected, coupons 1 through 5 each have a cash value of $200, coupons 6 through 20 each have a cash value of $100, and coupons 21 through 50 each have a cash value of $50.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Explain how you would conduct a simulation using the random number table provided below to estimate the distribution of the number of prize winners each week.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Perform your simulation three times.
