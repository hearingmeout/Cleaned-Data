If the first scheduled surgery got delayed, then all of the other surgeries scheduled for that day also got delayed. For three weeks (a total of 15 days) the administrator recorded how many minutes past the scheduled time the first surgery began each weekday. The data are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 160px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with the title minutes past scheduled starting time and one row with values 25, 45, 73, 50, 81, 40, 56, 40, 45, 14, 30, 63, 50, 39, and 45.\" height=\"69\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/505db8f9c546e96cb15c8c71d752d691/original.png\" width=\"550\" /></p>\n\n<p>The administrator sent a memo to the hospital’s entire surgical staff to ask that everyone work to reduce the delay in the starting time for the first nonemergency surgery each day. The administrator recorded how many minutes past the scheduled starting time the first scheduled surgery began each weekday for the three weeks after the memo was sent out. The data are shown in the table below. A negative number in the table indicates that the surgery started earlier than the scheduled time.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 160px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with the title minutes past scheduled starting time after the memo was sent out and one row with values 64, 43, 20, negative 28, 15, 45, 72, 82, 25, 50, 62, 89, negative 10, 45, and 50.\" height=\"66\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/68452de66fdd14d4e8db2b543844b5ce/original.png\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>The dotplots below display the distributions of minutes past the scheduled starting time before the memo went out and after the memo went out.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The figure shows two separate dotplots, each plotted on a number line.
