The researchers are deciding whether to have subjects wear an activity tracker to record the data or to have subjects keep a daily journal of the miles they walk each day. Describe what bias could be introduced by keeping the daily journal instead of wearing the activity tracker.</p></div>\n","rubricRef":"VR189111_rubric"},{"id":"VR189111","type":"longtextV2","stimulusHtml":"<div class=\"item_part part_id:B part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"B\"><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">During the course of the study, the subjects will have their cholesterol levels measured each month by a doctor.
