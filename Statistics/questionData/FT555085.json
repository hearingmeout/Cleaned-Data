Filling equipment is used to load ore into the hopper cars. When functioning properly, the actual weights of ore loaded into each car by the filling equipment at the mine are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 70 tons and a standard deviation of 0.9 ton. If the mean is greater than 70 tons, the loading mechanism is overfilling.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If the filling equipment is functioning properly, what is the probability that the weight of the ore in a randomly selected car will be 70.7 tons or more?
