Researchers measured the mean times required to obtain relief from a headache for patients taking one of the medications. From a random sample of 75 people with chronic headaches, 38 were randomly assigned to medication R and the remaining 37 were assigned to medication S. The time, in minutes, until each person experienced relief from a headache was recorded. The sample mean times were calculated for each medication.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Have the conditions been met for inference with a confidence interval for the difference in population means?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH971085_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, all conditions have been met.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the data were not collected using a random sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because cause and effect cannot be inferred since there is a random sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the sample sizes are not large enough to assume the distribution of the difference in sample means is approximately normal.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because the sample sizes are not the same.</p>"],"answer":0}]
