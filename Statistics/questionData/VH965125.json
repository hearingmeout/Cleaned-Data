They selected a random sample of 40 16-ounce cups of coffee made at different times of the day during a one-month period. The mean and standard deviation of the amount of caffeine in the sample were 159.88 mg and 36.72 mg, respectively. A graph of the sample data revealed a right skew with one outlier. The researchers will construct a confidence interval to estimate the amount of caffeine for all 16-ounce cups made at the machine.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following conditions is <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">not</span> needed for the inference?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH965125_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The samples were selected at random.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The observations are independent of one another.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The sample size of 40 is less than 10% of the population size.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The graph of the sample data is symmetric with no outliers.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The sample size is large enough to assume that the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal.</p>"],"answer":3}]
