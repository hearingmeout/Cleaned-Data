A regulatory agency will recommend the new drug for use if there is convincing evidence that the mean reduction in cholesterol level after one month of use is more than 20 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl), because a mean reduction of this magnitude would be greater than the mean reduction for the current most widely used drug.</p>\n\n<p>The pharmaceutical company collected data by giving the new drug to a random sample of 50 people from the population of people with high cholesterol. The reduction in cholesterol level after one month of use was recorded for each individual in the sample, resulting in a sample mean reduction and standard deviation of 24 mg/dl and 15 mg/dl, respectively.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The regulatory agency decides to use an interval estimate for the population mean reduction in cholesterol level for the new drug. Provide this 95 percent confidence interval. Be sure to interpret this interval.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Because the 95 percent confidence interval includes 20, the regulatory agency is not convinced that the new drug is better than the current best-seller. The pharmaceutical company tested the following hypotheses.</p>\n\n\t<p class=\"text-center\"><span aria-label=\"ratio of cap h sub 0 to mu is equal to 20\"><math> <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mi>H</mi> <mn>0</mn> </msub> <mo>:</mo> <mi>μ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>20</mn> </mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaamisamaaBaaaleaacaaIWaaabeaakiaacQdacqaH8oqBcqGH9aqpcaaIYaGaaGimaaaa@3CA1@</annotation> </semantics> </math></span><i>&nbsp;</i>versus<i>&nbsp;</i><span aria-label=\"ratio of cap h sub A to mu is greater than 20 comma\"><math> <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mi>H</mi> <mi>a</mi> </msub> <mo>:</mo><mi>μ</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>20</mn><mo>,</mo> </mrow> <annotation encoding=\"MathType-MTEF\">MathType@MTEF@5@5@+=feaagCart1ev2aaatCvAUfeBSjuyZL2yd9gzLbvyNv2CaerbuLwBLnhiov2DGi1BTfMBaeXatLxBI9gBaerbd9wDYLwzYbItLDharqqtubsr4rNCHbGeaGqiVu0Je9sqqrpepC0xbbL8F4rqqrFfpeea0xe9Lq=Jc9vqaqpepm0xbba9pwe9Q8fs0=yqaqpepae9pg0FirpepeKkFr0xfr=xfr=xb9adbaqaaeGaciGaaiaabeqaamaabaabaaGcbaGaamisamaaBaaaleaacaWGHbaabeaakiaacQdacqaH8oqBcqGH+aGpcaaIYaGaaGimaiaacYcaaaa@3D7F@</annotation> </semantics> </math></span></p>\n\n\t<p>where <em>µ</em> represents the population mean reduction in cholesterol level for the new drug.</p>\n\n\t<p>The test procedure resulted in a <em>t</em>-value of 1.89 and a <em>p</em>-value of 0.033.
