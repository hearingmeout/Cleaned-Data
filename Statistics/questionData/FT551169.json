There were only enough travel funds to send 3 people. The manager selected 3 people to attend and stated that the people were selected at random. The 3 people selected were women. There were concerns that no men were selected to attend the convention.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Calculate the probability that randomly selecting 3 people from a group of 6 men and 3 women will result in selecting 3 women.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Based on your answer to part (a), is there reason to doubt the manager’s claim that the 3 people were selected at random? Explain.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>An alternative to calculating the exact probability is to conduct a simulation to estimate the probability. A proposed simulation process is described below.</p>\n\n\t<p>Each trial in the simulation consists of rolling three fair, six-sided dice, one die for each of the convention attendees. For each die, rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4 represents selecting a man; rolling a 5 or 6 represents selecting a woman. After 1,000 trials, the number of times the dice indicate selecting 3 women is recorded.</p>\n\n\t<p><br>\n\tDoes the proposed process correctly simulate the random selection of 3 women from a group of 9 people consisting of 6 men and 3 women? Explain why or why not.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n"}]
