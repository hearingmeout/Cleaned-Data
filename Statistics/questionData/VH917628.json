The probability of a tack landing point up is 0.2. A simulation was conducted in which a trial consisted of tossing 5 thumbtacks and recording the number of thumbtacks that land point up. Many trials of the simulation were conducted and the results are shown in the histogram.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Based on the results of the simulation, which of the following is closest to the probability that at least 2 thumbtacks land pointing up when 5 thumbtacks are tossed?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH917628_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">0.09</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">0.19</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">0.28</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">0.72</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">0.91</p>"],"answer":2}]
