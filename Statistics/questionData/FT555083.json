Scientists studied 11 impact craters on the Moon to determine whether there was any relationship between the age of the craters (based on radioactive dating of lunar rocks) and the impact rate (as deduced from the density of the craters). The data are displayed in the scatterplot below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A scatter plot is shown with impact rate in units of times 10 to the power of 6 grams per million years on the vertical axis and age in billions of years on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled from 0 to 8000 in increments of 1000 and the horizontal axis is labeled from 0.4 to 1.4 in increments of 0.5. Points are plotted starting at about 0.4 and 8000, then the next point is at approximately 0.5 and 4000, then 0.6 and 500, and the last eight points are spread evenly along the remainder of the horizontal axis at a height of approximately 0.\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/0895cd6b110a5c5a4f9c4fd78562f075/original.png\" width=\"750\" /></p>\n\n<p>a. Describe the nature of the relationship between impact rate and age.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to fitting a linear regression model, the researchers transformed both impact rate and age by using logarithms. The following computer output and residual plot were produced.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"An image of the output of a regression analysis is shown. At the top it reads regression equation: natural log of rate equals 4.82 minus 3.92 times the natural log of age. Below this is a table with five columns labeled predictor, coefficient, S E coefficient, T, and P. The first row reads constant, 4.8247, 0.1931, 24.98, and 0. The second row reads natural log of age, negative 3.9232, 0.4514, negative 8.69, and 0. Below the table it reads S equals 0.5977, R squared equals 89.4 percent, and R squared adjusted equals 88.2 percent.\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/eb8f86323c19dcf9cf5e70df2de1402c/original.png\" width=\"590\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A graph is shown with residual from negative 1 to 1 on the vertical axis and fitted value from 3.5 to 8.5 on the horizontal axis.

To the right of this there are three points that then follow an upward trend with approximate coordinates 6.8 and negative 0.5, 7.3 and 0.9, and 8.4 and 0.8.\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/2a997d2f8af3c3628970023926fad0b5/original.png\" width=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p>b.
