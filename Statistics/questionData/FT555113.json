He wants to model this relationship. John records his pulse rate, in beats per minute (bpm), while walking at each of seven different speeds, in miles per hour (mph). A scatterplot and regression output are shown below.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A graph is shown with pulse on the vertical axis and speed on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled with values 70 through 140 in increments of 10, and the horizontal axis is labeled with values 0 through 4.5 in increments of 0.5. Seven values are plotted on the graph that form nearly a straight line across the diagonal of the graph and have approximate coordinates 0.5 and 72, 1.0 and 80, 1.5 and 90, 2.8 and 110, 3.3 and 113, 4.0 and 130, and 4.5 and 143.\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/c9bc5394894d7028fbb955cb5da74fcd/original.png\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Two tables of data analysis are shown in an image. Above the first table it reads Regression analysis: pulse versus speed. The table has five columns with headings predictor, coefficient, S E coefficient, T, and P.

Below this is a line that reads S equals 3.087, R squared equals 98.7 percent, and R squared adjusted equals 98.5 percent. Above the second table it reads analysis of variance. The table has six columns with headings source, D F, S S, M S, F, and P. The first row reads regression, 1, 3763.2, 3763.2, 396.13, and 0.
