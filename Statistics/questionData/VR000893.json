The reporter selected a random sample of dining parties from a certain region. The resulting data were used to complete a linear regression analysis of the time, in minutes, it takes for a dining party to be seated versus the number of people in the dining party. The linear regression analysis produced the residual plot shown.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot in the coordinate plane.
