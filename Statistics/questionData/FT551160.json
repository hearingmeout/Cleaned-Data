A stratified random sample of five locations (based on categories of distance from the coast) was selected from each of three coastal regions in the southeastern United States. The three regions were Gulf Coast (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi), Florida, and Lower Atlantic (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina). Damage amounts in millions of dollars per acre, adjusted for inflation, are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with the title hurricane damage amounts in millions of dollars per acre.
