[{"id":"FT543914","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"To check the effect of cold temperature on the elasticity of two brands of rubber bands, one box of Brand A and one box of Brand B rubber bands are tested. Ten bands from the Brand A box are placed in a freezer for two hours and ten bands from the Brand B box are kept at room temperature. The amount of stretch before breakage is measured on each rubber band, and the mean for the cold bands is compared to the mean for the others. Is this a good experimental design?","choicesHtml":["<p>No, because the means are not proper statistics for comparison.</p>","<p>No, because more than two brands should be used.</p>","<p>No, because more temperatures should be used.</p>","<p>No, because temperature is confounded with brand.</p>","Yes"],"answer":2}]
