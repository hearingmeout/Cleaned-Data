[{"id":"VH968139","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An administrator at a local high school wanted to investigate whether there is an association between the amount of time a student studies for a test and the type of extracurricular activity the student is involved in. Three hundred students selected at random were asked how long they had studied for the last math test and how many extracurricular activities they are involved in. The times they had studied were recorded as either not at all, less than 30 minutes, or more than 30 minutes. Each student also identified which extracurricular activity (out of a total of 5 extra curricular activities) they were involved in. The calculated chi-square test statistic was 7.53 with a corresponding <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"p\"><math alttext=\"p\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-value of 0.4807.
