The health professional selected a random sample of 6 figure skaters and measured the stress level before a routine practice session and before a major competition. Each variable was measured as the change in the interval between heartbeats, or heart rate variability. The health professional wants to estimate the mean change in the stress level before a major competition for each unit increase in the stress level before a routine practice.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Assuming the conditions for inference have been met, which of the following inference procedures is the most appropriate for such an investigation?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH990743_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A matched-pairs <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a mean difference</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between proportions</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A linear regression <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for slope</p>"],"answer":4}]
