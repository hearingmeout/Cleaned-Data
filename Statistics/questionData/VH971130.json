In one study, a random sample of 12 men had a mean of 7.95 days and a standard deviation of 6.2 days, and a random sample of 19 women had a mean of 7.1 days and a standard deviation of 5.0 days. The sample data will be used to construct a 95 percent confidence interval to estimate the difference between men and women in the mean number of days for the length of stay at a hospital.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Have the conditions been met for inference with a confidence interval?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH971130_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes.
