The horizontal axis is labeled x, and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 5, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Residual, and the numbers negative 5.0 through 7.5, in increments of 2.5, are indicated. A horizontal line is drawn at Residual point 0.0 and the data points are scattered throughout the plane. The values represented by the data points are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The data points begin in the left part of the coordinate plane underneath the horizontal line at point 1 comma negative 1, and trend steeply downward and to the right, reaching a depth of point 4.5 comma negative 5.1. They then increase steeply to the right, crossing the horizontal line and reaching a peak at approximately point 11 comma 6.0. The data points then decrease steeply to the right, crossing back across the horizontal line and reaching a depth of 19 comma negative 5.0.\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH910443.g03.png\" width=\"500\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">What is indicated by the plot?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH910443_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A linear model is appropriate.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A linear model is not appropriate.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Variability in <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"y\"><math alttext=\"y\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> is constant for all values <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"x\"><math alttext=\"x\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At least one point is influential with respect to the regression.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">At least one point is an outlier with respect to the regression.</p>"],"answer":1}]
