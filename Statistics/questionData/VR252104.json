The uniforms are composed of two garments: a shirt and a pair of shorts, both of which are the same fabric and color and receive the same amount of wear when worn by the delivery drivers.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"item_part part_id:a part_name:ExtendedText response_class:FreeResponse response_type:Essay\" id=\"a\">\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A random sample of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"40\"><math alttext=\"40\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>40</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> dirty uniforms was selected from those sent by the delivery business and Detergent G was randomly assigned to clean the shirt for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"20\"><math alttext=\"20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> uniforms and the pair of shorts for the other <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"20\"><math alttext=\"20\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> uniforms. Detergent T was assigned to clean the other garment for each uniform. After the uniforms were cleaned, an employee at the company who was not aware of which detergent was used rated the cleanliness of each garment on a scale from <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"0\"><math alttext=\"0\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"100\"><math alttext=\"100\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>100</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>, with larger values indicating greater cleanliness.
