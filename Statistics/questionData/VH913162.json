Partial-cut harvesting is increasingly used to lessen the effects of logging on the animals. The following scatterplot shows the relationship between the density of red squirrels, in squirrels per plot, 2 to 4 years after partial-cut harvesting, and the percent of trees that were harvested in each of 11 forests.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a scatterplot in the coordinate plane with 11 data points. The horizontal axis is labeled Percent of Trees Harvested, and the numbers 0 through 70, in increments of 10, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Squirrels per Plot, and the numbers 4 through 20, in increments of 2, are indicated. The data points represented in the scatterplot are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. The data points are: 0 comma 18, 0 comma 14.5, 10 comma 12.5, 30 comma 10, 32 comma 13, 38 comma 9, 42 comma 9.5, 50 comma 12, 51 comma 10, 54 comma 5.5, and 63 comma 7.5.   \" height=\"236\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH913162.g03.png\" width=\"300\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the best description of the relationship displayed in the scatterplot?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH913162_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Negative, linear, and strong</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Positive, linear, and weak</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Negative, nonlinear, and strong</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Positive, nonlinear, and weak</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Positive, nonlinear, and strong</p>"],"answer":0}]
