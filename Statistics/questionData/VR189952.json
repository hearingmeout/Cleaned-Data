Fourteen fifth-grade students participated in two trials of the study. For one trial, the students rode a stationary bicycle for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"15\"><math alttext=\"15\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> minutes while watching a video of someone cycling through a forest. For the other trial, the students rode a stationary bicycle for <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"15\"><math alttext=\"15\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mn>15</mn></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> minutes without watching a video. Each student completed both trials in a randomized order. The researchers recorded the students’ heart rates after each trial.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the best description of the study?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR189952_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A randomized matched-pairs experiment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A randomized placebo-controlled experiment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A completely randomized experiment</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A sample survey</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">An observational study</p>"],"answer":0}]
