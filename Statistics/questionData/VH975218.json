A random sample of 50 bags from each of Brand X and Brand Y was selected. Each bag was held from its rim, and one-ounce weights were dropped into the bag one at a time from the same height until the bag ripped. The number of ounces the bag held before ripping was recorded, and the mean number of ounces for each brand was calculated.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is the appropriate test for the study?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH975218_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A matched-pairs <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a mean difference</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a difference between population means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a difference between population proportions</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a difference between sample means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a population proportion</p>"],"answer":1}]
