Researchers studied a liquid repellent designed to reduce such damage. A sample of 20 wooden blocks of the same size were treated with the repellent and left outside in an area where porcupines are known to live. After a certain amount of time, the blocks were inspected for the number of porcupine teeth marks visible.
