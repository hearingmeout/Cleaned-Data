[{"id":"VR000188","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A seafood festival organizer is interested in whether there is a relationship between the number of ingredients in the clam chowders that are entered in the festival’s clam chowder contest and the ratings given to the chowders by the judges. The organizer requires each of the twelve restaurants in the competition to list all of its chowder's ingredients and requires each judge who tastes the clam chowders to rate each chowder from one through ten on a note card. The organizer then randomly selects twenty-five note cards. Assuming that all conditions for inference are met, which of the following significance tests should be used to investigate whether having more ingredients in the chowders is associated with a reduction in the ratings given to the chowders by the judges?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VR000188_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A chi-square test of independence</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a difference between means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a difference between proportions</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A linear regression <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for slope</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A matched pairs <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-test for a mean difference</p>"],"answer":3}]
