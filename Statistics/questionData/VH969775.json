[{"id":"VH969775","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A snowboarding competition site is using a new design for the parallel giant slalom. The designer of the slalom is investigating whether there is a difference in the mean times taken to complete a run for men and women competitors. As part of the investigation, independent random samples of men and women who will use the slalom run are selected and their times to complete a run are recorded. Which of the following is the appropriate inference procedure by which the designer can estimate the difference in the mean completion times for men and women?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH969775_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a sample mean</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a population mean</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A matched pairs <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a mean difference</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between population means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between sample means</p>"],"answer":3}]
