Each month, the company publishes the sales volume for each agent. Monthly sales volume is defined as the total sales price of all homes sold by the agent during a month. The figure below displays the cumulative relative frequency plot of the most recent monthly sales volume (in hundreds of thousands of dollars) for these agents.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A graph is shown with cumulative relative frequency on the vertical axis and monthly sales volume in hundreds of thousands of dollars on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is labeled in increments of 0.1 from 0 to 1.0 with every other increment labeled, and the horizontal axis is labeled in increments of 1 from 0 to 12 with every increment labeled. Horizontal and vertical reference lines are drawn to form a grid on the graph. Data points are plotted and connected by straight, solid line segments. The points are plotted at 0 and 0, 1 and 0.1, 2 and 0.2, 3 and 0.4, 4 and .45, 5 and 0.6, 6 and 0.63, 7 and 0.7, 8 and 0.8, 9 and 0.85, 10 and 0.9, 11 and 0.9, and 12 and 1.0. A circle is drawn around the point at 3 and 0.4. \" height=\"274\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/2682b292595f4ba3178c68275b38f9db/original.png\" width=\"800\" /></p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In the context of this question, explain what information is conveyed by the circled point.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>What proportion of sales agents achieved monthly sales volumes between $700,000 and $800,000 ?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For values between 10 and 11 on the horizontal axis, the cumulative relative frequency plot is flat.
