For the new route, the company has a choice of running coaches that can carry up to 60 people or smaller vans that can carry up to 12 people. The company has a policy that each of its routes is served only by one type of shuttle vehicle. In addition, due to the allocation of their vehicles to other routes, no change in their decision can be considered for at least a year. The annual return (profit or loss) depends on whether the demand for the service is strong or weak. Research suggests that the following returns can be expected.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with the heading annual return 10,000 dollars. The table has three columns. The left column is labeled vehicle decision. The middle column is labeled strong and the right column is labeled weak, and these are both under the heading demand. The first row reads coach, 84, and negative 27. The second row reads van, 61, and 45.\" height=\"161\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/292d99052d6720f848ae40b6cc8f6ab4/original.png\" width=\"750\" /></p>\n\n<p>For instance, if a coach is used and demand is strong, the expected annual return is $840,000. The expected return to the company can be calculated based on the probability of a strong demand. Let <em>p</em> represent the probability of strong demand; then (1 – <em>p</em>) represents the probability of weak demand.</p>\n\n<p>An equation that can be used to compute the expected return from the use of coaches based on the value of <em>p</em> is</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">84p + (-27)(1 - p) = 111p - 27</p>\n\n<p>An equation that can be used to compute the expected return from the use of vans based on the value of <em>p</em> is</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">61p + 45(1 - p) = 16p + 45</p>\n\n<p>These two functions are shown on the graph on the next page.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><img alt=\"A graph is shown with expected return from negative 50 to 100 in increments of 25 on the vertical axis and probability p of strong demand from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.2 on the horizontal axis. Two lines are plotted. The first line starts on the vertical axis at about 45 and ends at probability 1 just above 50. The second line starts on the vertical axis just below negative 25 and ends at probability 1 around 80. The two lines intersect around 0.75 and 50. \" height=\"182\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/98075d07952bac48744b41e760342bd6/original.png\" width=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The value of <em>p</em> for which the expected annual return for the vans is equal to the expected annual return for the coaches is 0.76. If the probability of strong demand is less than this value, which decision, running coaches or running vans, will provide the greater expected return? Justify your answer.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>There are several thousand markets similar to Lonestar’s market across the country. A random sample of 100 of these markets reveals that the demand for an airport shuttle is strong in 65 of them and the demand in the remaining 35 is weak. Using the results of this sample, construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the proportion of similar markets that will experience a strong demand.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The president of Blue Shell has decided to use vans for the new route. Using the results of the analysis in parts (a) and (b), write a few sentences to justify this decision.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After looking at the interval in part (b) and considering possible annual returns, the vice president of Blue Shell believes that the president has made an incorrect decision in choosing to use vans. Explain how this conflicting position could be supported.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n"}]
