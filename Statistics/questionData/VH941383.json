Three simulations, A, B, and C, were designed to create a sampling distribution of a sample proportion from a population with proportion 0.70. Each simulation consisted of 2,500 trials. For each trial of a simulation, a sample of size <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n\"><math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> was selected at random, and the sample proportion was recorded. The value of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"n\"><math alttext=\"n\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span> varied among the simulations. The following histograms summarize the results of the simulations.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with 10 bars of data, labeled Simulation A.
