The builders of the new machine claim that it produces fewer defective microchips than the older machine. From a random sample of 90 microchips produced on the old machine, 5 were found to be defective. From a random sample of 83 microchips produced on the new machine, 3 were found to be defective. The quality control manager wants to construct a confidence interval to estimate the difference between the proportion of defective microchips from the older machine and the proportion of defective microchips from the new machine.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Why is it <span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">not</span> appropriate to calculate a two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"z\"><math alttext=\"z\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference in proportions?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH954502_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The microchips were not randomly assigned to a machine.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">There is no guarantee that microchips are approximately normally distributed.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The normality of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions cannot be established.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Both sample proportions are less than 0.10.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The sample sizes are not the same.</p>"],"answer":2}]
