The following scatterplot shows the velocity after feeding, in centimeters per second, and the proportional increase in weight after feeding relative to the weight before feeding. For example, 0.5 indicates a 50&nbsp;percent weight gain after feeding. One point on the graph is labeled <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"TThe figure presents a scatterplot in a coordinate plane. The horizontal axis is labeled Proportional Increase in Weight, and the numbers 0 through 2, in increments of 0.25, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Velocity, in centimeters per second, and the numbers 0 through 20, in increments of 2.5, are indicated. There are 33 data points in the scatterplot. Note that all values are approximate. The data points begin at negative 0.20 comma 12.5 in the middle left part of the scatterplot. The data points general trend rightward and are scattered throughout the lower part of the coordinate plane. There is one point that is labeled M with the coordinates negative 0.15 comma 19.9 whose y-coordinate is approximately 7.5 centimeters per second greater than the next highest y-coordinate.\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VH913653.g03.png\" width=\"425\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">What is unusual about point <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"M\" role=\"math\"><math alttext=\"M\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH913653_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It represents a mosquito that gained the least weight after feeding.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It represents a mosquito that gained the most weight after feeding.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It represents a mosquito that flew very fast after feeding relative to all other mosquitoes.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">It makes the linear relationship between the variables appear much stronger.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The point must be an error in data entry because weight cannot be less than 0.</p>"],"answer":2}]
