Heart attack patients in participating cities were treated with either a cardiopump or CPR, depending on whether the individual’s heart attack occurred on an even-numbered or an odd-numbered day of the month. Before the start of the study, a coin was tossed to determine which treatment, a cardiopump or CPR, was given on the even-numbered days. The other treatment was given on the odd-numbered days. In total, 754 patients were treated with a cardiopump, and 37 survived at least one year; while 746 patients were treated with CPR, and 15 survived at least one year.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The conditions for inference are satisfied in the study.
