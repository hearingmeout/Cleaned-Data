The study will investigate the difference in back problems for workers who stand and workers who sit. A group of 68 volunteers have agreed to participate in the nine-month study. Half the group is randomly assigned to work while standing, and the other half is assigned to work while sitting. At the end of the study, the mean number of back problems between the two groups will be calculated. The officer will use the results to estimate the difference in the mean number of back problems between those who work while standing and those who work while sitting.</p></div></div></div></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following is an appropriate inference procedure for the study?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH969763_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a population mean</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A one-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a sample mean</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A matched pairs <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a mean difference</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between sample means</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A two-sample <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"t\"><math alttext=\"t\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>-interval for a difference between population means</p>"],"answer":4}]
