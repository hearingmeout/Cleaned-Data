To investigate the behavior of these estimators, 500 random samples are selected from a known population and each statistic is calculated for each sample. The true value of the population parameter is 75. The graphs below show the distribution of values for each statistic.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\"><img alt=\"Four bar graphs are shown with horizontal axes only, which are labeled from 50 to 100 in increments of 25. The first graph is labeled statistic A, and its bars start out shorter on the left around 60, increase to a peak at 75, then get shorter again before ending around 90, with the bars on the right shorter than those on the left. The second graph is labeled statistic B, and its bars start out short on the left around 70, increase to a peak around 80, then get shorter again until 100, with the bars approximately symmetric around the peak. The third graph is labeled statistic C, and its bars start out tall on the left around 65, decrease to a minimum at 75, and increase to the same height they started at by 85. The fourth graph is labeled statistic D, and its bars are approximately the same intermediate height from 50 to 100.\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/f18243da70fc463c3fc74e36314a6668/original.png\" width=\"750\" /></p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Which of the statistics appear to be unbiased estimators of the population parameter?
