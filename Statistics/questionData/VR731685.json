The chocolatier hired <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"40\"><math alttext=\"40\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>40</mn></math></span></span> professional taste testers to participate in an experiment. The chocolatier flipped a coin for each participant. If the coin landed on heads, the participant tasted the new dark chocolate candy first, then tasted the current dark chocolate candy. If the coin landed on tails, the participant tasted the current dark chocolate candy first, then tasted the new dark chocolate candy. The participants rated the bitterness of each dark chocolate candy on a scale of <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span> to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10\"><math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math></span></span>, with <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"1\"><math alttext=\"1\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>1</mn></math></span></span> being the least bitter and <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10\"><math alttext=\"10\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math></span></span> being the most bitter.
