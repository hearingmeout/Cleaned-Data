They conducted an experiment in which 20 basketball players with similar abilities were randomly assigned to two groups. The 10 players in group 1 received visualization training, and the 10 players in group 2 did not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Each player stood 22 feet from the basket at the same location on the basketball court. Each player was then instructed to attempt to make the basket until two consecutive baskets were made. The players who received visualization training were instructed to use visualization techniques before attempting to make the basket. The total number of attempts, including the last two attempts, were recorded for each player.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The total number of attempts for each of the 20 players are summarized in the following boxplots.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents two boxplots above a number line labeled, Total Number of Attempts, with the numbers 0 through 25, in increments of 5.
