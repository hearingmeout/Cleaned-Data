Residential status is categorized as on campus for students living in university housing and off campus otherwise. A simple random sample of 100 students in the university was taken, and each student was asked the following two questions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Are you an on campus student or an off campus student?</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In how many extracurricular activities do you participate?</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The responses of the 100 students are summarized in the frequency table shown.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with four columns labeled level of participation in extracurricular activities, on campus, off campus, and total. The middle two columns are under the larger heading of residential status. The first row reads no activities, 9, 30, and 39. The second row reads one activity, 17, 25 and 42. The third row reads two or more activities, 7, 12, and 19. The fourth row reads total, 33, 67, and 100.\" height=\"143\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/289b3f9495c5a5999135beb3ca9a2302/original.png\" width=\"635\" /></p>\n\n<p>a. Calculate the proportion of on campus students in the sample who participate in at least one extracurricular activity and the proportion of off campus students in the sample who participate in at least one extracurricular activity.</p>\n\n<p>On campus proportion:</p>\n\n<p>Off campus proportion:</p>\n\n<p>The responses of the 100 students are summarized in the segmented bar graph shown.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A horizontal bar graph is shown with residential status on the vertical axis and percent from 0 to 100 in increments of 20 percent on the horizontal axis. For the two residential statuses shown there is a horizontal bar from the vertical axis to 100 percent, and it is divided in to three sections. The legend indicates that the black section represents none, the grey section represents one, and the white section represents two or more. In the off campus bar the black section extends to about 45 percent, the grey section extends from there to about 80 percent, and the white section extends from there to 100 percent. In the on campus bar the black section extends to about 25 percent, the grey section extends from there to about 75 percent, and the white section extends from there to 100 percent.\" height=\"152\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/ed5b6acc2cfe2f050b9dee90ebba87a4/original.png\" width=\"625\" /></p>\n\n<p>b. Write a few sentences summarizing what the graph reveals about the association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the 100 students in the sample.</p>\n\n<p>c. After verifying that the conditions for inference were satisfied, the administrator performed a chi-square test of the following hypotheses.</p>\n\n<p>H<sub>0</sub> : There is no association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the students at the university.</p>\n\n<p>H<sub>a</sub> : There is an association between residential status and level of participation in extracurricular activities among the students at the university.</p>\n\n<p>The test resulted in a <em>p</em>-value of 0.23. Based on the <em>p</em>-value, what conclusion should the administrator make?</p>\n"}]
