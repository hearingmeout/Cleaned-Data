A scatterplot created from a sample of houses shows an exponential relationship between price, in thousands of dollars, and size, in 100 square feet. To create a linear model, the natural logarithm of price was taken and the least-squares regression line was given as <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"the natural log of, open parenthesis, price hat, close parenthesis, equals 2.08 plus, 0.11 times size\"><math alttext=\"the natural log of, open parenthesis, price hat, close parenthesis, equals 2.08 plus, 0.11 times size\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mstyle><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mover><mrow><mi>p</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>^</mo></mrow></mover><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>2.08</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.11</mn><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>z</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mstyle></math></span></span>.
