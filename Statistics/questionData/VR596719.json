The new formula was randomly assigned to <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10\"><math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math></span></span> squares, and the older formula was assigned to the remaining <span class=\"math_expression\"><span aria-label=\"10\"><math alttext=\"10\" display=\"inline\" overflow=\"scroll\"><mn>10</mn></math></span></span> squares. Each square was painted with the assigned formula.
