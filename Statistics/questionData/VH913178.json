Each hole made by a woodpecker was classified as either drumming (territorial signaling), foresting (looking for food), or nesting. The following bar chart shows the relative frequency of the holes for each type of siding.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a segmented bar chart. The horizontal axis is labeled Type of Siding, and the following sidings are indicated: Clapboard, Grooved Plywood, and Nonwood. The vertical axis is labeled Relative Frequency, and the numbers 0 through 1.00, in increments of 0.25, are indicated. Each bar contains data for type of damage by behavior: drumming, foraging, or nesting. The data represented in the bar chart is as follows. Note that all values are approximate.Clapboard siding, nesting, 0.65, foraging, 0.05, drumming, 0.30. Grooved Plywood siding, nesting, 0.15, foraging, 0.75, drumming, 0.10.
