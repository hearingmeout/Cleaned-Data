Since 1915 scientists have repeatedly found estimates of <em>γ</em> using various methods and procedures. Each estimate has a margin of error. The figure below displays</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">(estimate ± margin of error)</p>\n\n<p>from each of 21 experiments.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"An error bar graph plots the estimates of 21 experiments and their respective margin of error. The horizontal axis represents the Order of Experiment, from earliest to most recent, going from left to right. The vertical axis represents the value of gamma ranging from negative 0.2 to 1.6, in increments of 0.2. A horizontal line is plotted at the value of gamma 1. The error bars are plotted with a value of gamma ranging from 0.8 to 1.3. The approximate data from the plot are as follows. Experiment 1: Estimate 1.3, Minimum 1.1, Maximum 1.45. Experiment 2: Estimate 0.8, Minimum 0.41, Maximum 1.2. Experiment 3: Estimate 0.92, Minimum 0.7, Maximum 1.2. Experiment 4: Estimate 0.93, Minimum 0.72, Maximum 1.15. Experiment 5: Estimate 1.3, Minimum 1.01, Maximum 1.6. Experiment 6: Estimate 0.995, Minimum 0.7, Maximum 1.3. Experiment 7: Estimate 1.09, Minimum 0.86, Maximum 1.3.
