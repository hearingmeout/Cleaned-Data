The points in the Old Stadium category are relatively constant. If a line of best fit were drawn, it would begin at the point with coordinates 1970, comma 16, slant upward and to the right, and end at the point with coordinates 1998, comma 17, and would have a very small, positive slope. The points in the New stadium category are strongly linear and have a greater positive slope than the points for the Old Stadium.
