Each respondent in the survey will be placed into one of the following two categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Does not have a high school diploma</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Has a high school diploma</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The survey will be conducted using a telephone interview. Random-digit dialing will be used to select the sample.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For this survey, state one potential source of bias <strong>and</strong> describe how it might affect the estimate of the proportion of adult heads of households in the United States who do not have a high school diploma.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A pilot survey indicated that about 22 percent of the population of adult heads of households do not have a high school diploma. Using this information, how many respondents should be obtained if the goal of the survey is to estimate the proportion of the population who do not have a high school diploma to within 0.03 with 95 percent confidence? Justify your answer.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Since education is largely the responsibility of each state, the agency wants to be sure that estimates are available for each state as well as for the nation. Identify a sampling method that will achieve this additional goal <strong>and</strong> briefly describe a way to select the survey sample using this method.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n"}]
