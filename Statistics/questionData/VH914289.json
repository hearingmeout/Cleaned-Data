The study will use 3 different types of clay because glaze can affect different clay in different ways. Eight bowls will be made with each clay type for a total of 24 bowls, and 4 different temperatures will be used. What is the best design to use for the study?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH914289_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">A completely randomized design.
