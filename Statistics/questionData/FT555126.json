A random sample of 12 people enrolled in the training program was selected. A measure of each person’s dexterity on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest) was recorded just before the start of and just after the completion of the 6-week program. The data are shown in the table below.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 120px;\"><img alt=\"A table is shown with three columns labeled person, before program, and after program.
