Scientists also believe that a repellent containing the new compound will be more effective than the ones that contain the current compound. To test the effectiveness of the new compound versus that of the current compound, scientists have randomly selected 100 people from a state.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 100 bins, with an equal number of mosquitoes in each bin, are available for use in the study. After a compound is applied to a participant’s forearm, the participant will insert his or her forearm into a bin for 1 minute, and the number of mosquito bites on the arm at the end of that time will be determined.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Suppose this study is to be conducted using a completely randomized design.
