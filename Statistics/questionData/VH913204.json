In the study, violins constructed before 1900 and violins constructed after 2010 were used. The violinists played each violin and were asked to classify the violin as old (constructed before 1900) or new (constructed after 2010). The responses are shown in the following table.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"table_wrapper\"><table class=\"tgroup cols:4\"><thead class=\"thead\"><tr class=\"row\"><th class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Violin</span> </th><th class=\"entry colname:col2\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Correctly Classified</span> </th><th class=\"entry colname:col3\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Incorrectly Classified </span> </th><th class=\"entry colname:col4\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Total</span> </th></tr></thead><tbody class=\"tbody\"><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">New </span><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">(constructed after 2010)</span> </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">15    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">18    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col4\">33    </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Old (constructed before 1900) </span> </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">18    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">13    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col4\">31    </td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td class=\"entry colname:col1\"><span class=\"formatted_text font_weight:bold\">Total</span> </td><td class=\"entry colname:col2\">33    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col3\">31    </td><td class=\"entry colname:col4\">64    </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Which of the following statements is supported by the results in the table?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH913204_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The proportion of all new violins that are correctly classified is equal to the proportion of all old violins that are correctly classified.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The proportion of all new violins that are incorrectly classified is equal to the proportion of all old violins that are correctly classified.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The proportion of all incorrectly classified violins that are old is equal to the proportion of all correctly classified violins that are new.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The proportion of all incorrectly classified violins that are new is equal to the proportion of all correctly classified violins that are new.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The proportion of all correctly classified violins that are old is equal to the proportion of all new violins that are incorrectly classified.</p>"],"answer":4}]
