Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation.</em></p>\n\n<p>A test consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions with 5 answer choices for each question is administered.

The test score is determined by awarding 1 point for each question answered correctly, deducting 0.25 point for each question answered incorrectly, and ignoring any question that is omitted.

Suppose a student knows the correct answers for 18 questions, answers those 18 questions correctly, and chooses randomly from the 5 choices for each of the other 7 questions. What is the probability that the student will pass the test?</p>\n"}]
