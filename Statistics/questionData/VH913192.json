The horizontal axis is labeled Moose Density, in moose per kilometers squared, and the numbers 1.0 to 2.0, in increments of 0.1, are indicated. The vertical axis is labeled Percent Change in Wolf Population, and the numbers negative 25 through 10, in increments of 5, are indicated. There are 19 data points in the scatterplot.
