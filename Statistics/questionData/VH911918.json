[{"id":"VH911918","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">For a specific species of fish in a pond, a wildlife biologist wants to build a regression equation to predict the weight of a fish based on its length. The biologist collects a random sample of this species of fish and finds that the lengths vary from 0.75 to 1.35 inches. The biologist uses the data from the sample to create a single linear regression model. Would it be appropriate to use this model to predict the weight of a fish of this species that is 3 inches long?</p>\n","rubricRef":"VH911918_rubric","choicesHtml":["<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the regression equation is based on a random sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Yes, because the association between length and weight is positive.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because 3 inches falls above the maximum value of lengths in the sample.</p>","<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">No, because there may not be any 3-inch fish of this species in the pond.</p>"],"answer":3}]
