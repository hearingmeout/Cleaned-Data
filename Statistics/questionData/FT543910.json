To compare the mean number of lesions produced by two different strains of virus, one strain is applied to half of each of 8 tobacco leaves, and the other strain is applied to the other half of each leaf. The strain that goes on the right half of the leaf is decided by a coin flip. The lesions that appear on each half are then counted.
