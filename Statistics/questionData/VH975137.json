Pigeons could accurately select the color of the plank of wood 20 percent of the time. A simulation was conducted in which a trial consisted of a pigeon being shown eight planks of wood and its number of successes being recorded. This process was repeated many times, and the results are shown in the histogram.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a histogram with 6 bars of data.
