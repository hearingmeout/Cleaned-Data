[{"id":"FT545740","type":"mcq","stimulusHtml":"<p>Makers of a new pain-relieving medication claim that it relieves chronic pain faster than the current top-selling pain reliever on the market. A double-blind experiment was conducted in which 10 people who experience chronic pain were randomly selected to take either the new or the current medication. Each of the 10 people recorded the time, in minutes, from taking the medication until pain relief. After an appropriate time period, each of the 10 people took the other medication and recorded the time from taking the medication until pain relief. The medication each person took first was randomly determined, and because both medications look the same, the people in the study did not know which medication was taken first. The table below shows summary statistics for the results.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"A table is shown with three columns. The first two columns, new medication and current medication, and under the larger heading of minutes until pain relief. The third column is labeled difference, new minus current. The first row is mean and reads 15.600, 16.025, and negative 0.425. The second row is standard deviation and reads 4.811, 4.833, and 1.395.\" height=\"145\" src=\"https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/d89b7176d42a6045e76103cb8c591453/original.jpg\" width=\"573\" /></p>\n\n<p>Which of the following values is closest to the <em>p</em>-value of the appropriate <em>t</em>-test?</p>\n","choicesHtml":["<p>0.1802</p>","<p>0.3604</p>","<p>0.4230</p>","<p>0.5770</p>","<p>0.8198</p>"],"answer":-1}]
