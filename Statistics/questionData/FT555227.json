A series of experiments will be designed to find colors or patterns that three bird species (blackbirds, starlings, and geese) will avoid eating. Representative samples of birds will be captured to use in the experiments, and the response variable will be the amount of time a hungry bird will avoid eating food of a particular color or pattern.</p>\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Previous research has shown that male birds do not avoid solid colors. However, it is possible that males might avoid colors displayed in a pattern, such as stripes. In an effort to prevent males from eating the pesticide, the following two treatments are applied to the pesticide granules.</p>\n\n\t<p>Treatment 1: A red background with narrow blue stripes</p>\n\n\t<p>Treatment 2: A blue background with narrow red stripes</p>\n\n\t<p>To increase the power of detecting a difference in the two treatments in the analysis of the experiment, the researcher decided to block on the three species of birds (blackbirds, starlings, and geese). Assuming there are 100 birds of each of the three species, explain how you would assign birds to treatments in such a block design.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Other than blocking, what could the researcher do to increase the power of detecting a difference in the two treatments in the analysis of the experiment? Explain how your approach would increase the power.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n"}]
