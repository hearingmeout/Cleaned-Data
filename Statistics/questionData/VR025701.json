As part of a study, the researchers prepared three sets of identical surveys and used three methods of delivering and returning the surveys. The methods are described as follows.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">In Class</span>: The surveys were given to students in a class, and students were asked to return completed surveys to their instructor.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Psychology</span>: The surveys were given to students participating in a psychology experiment, and students were asked to return completed surveys to a collection box in the hallway of the psychology building.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\"><span class=\"formatted_text text_decoration:underline\">Dining Hall</span>: The surveys were given to students in the dining hall, and students were asked to return completed surveys to a collection box outside the dining hall.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\">The graph shows the percent of surveys returned and not returned for each delivery method.</p>\n\n<div class=\"standalone_image\"><img alt=\"The figure presents a segmented horizontal bar graph. The horizontal axis is labeled “Rate of Return,” and the numbers 0% through 100%, in increments of 20%, are indicated. The vertical axis has the following three categories indicated: In Class, Psychology, and Dining Hall. Each category has one bar, and each bar is divided into two parts. A key indicates that one part represents “returned the survey,” and that the other part represents “did not return the survey.” The data presented by the bars are as follows. Note that all values are approximate. Bar 1. In Class: returned the survey, 58%; did not return the survey, 42%. Bar 2. Psychology: returned the survey, 48%; did not return the survey, 52%. Bar 3.
