The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"passage_para\"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">George Washington’s Farewell Address, 1796</span></em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM US Government & Politics"]},"cat":{"t":[398845,398846,398870,398874,398875,399121,399125,399128,399129,398816,398835,398837],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Primary Source"],"Security":["Teacher Use Only"],"Question Type":["MCQ"],"Question Set":["Yes"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR027580":{"id":"VR027580","q":{"id":"VR027580","t":"mcq","s":"<div><include href=\"../Passage/VR027579.qti.xml\" xmlns:xi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude\"></include></div><p class=\"stem_paragraph\">By using the phrase “creative federalism,” President Johnson is most likely referring to which of the following features of the American system?</p>\n","o":[{"v":"i1","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The relationship between the national and state governments evolves over time and is flexible enough to permit new forms of interaction.</p>"},{"v":"i2","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">National policymaking is constrained by the sharing of power between the three branches of government.</p>"},{"v":"i3","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">The balance of power between the states and national government has been trending toward more national regulation and less state control.</p>"},{"v":"i4","l":"<p class=\"choice_paragraph\">Congress may use the commerce clause to address problems in public schools such as lack of resources and school safety.</p>"}],"a":"i1","f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_5968789ccb1a0586df1ba9f584d67f78","c":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated.

This authority rests, in part, on the National Government’s constitutional power to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations with foreign nations.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">&nbsp;</div>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:FYM US Government & Politics"]},"cat":{"t":[398845,398846,398884,398885,398887,398888,398894,398941,398944,398945,399121,399125,399128,399129,398816,398817,398822,398823,398824,398826],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["SCOTUS Case"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR027679":{"id":"VR027679","q":{"id":"VR027679","t":"longtextV2","s":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">In your response, you should do the following:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"table_wrapper\">\n<table class=\"tgroup cols:2 colsep:0 frame:none rowsep:0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec align:right colname:col1 colnum:1 colwidth:75\" />\n\t\t<col class=\"colspec colname:col2 colnum:2 colwidth:500\" />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody class=\"tbody\">\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">✓</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Respond to the prompt with a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of reasoning.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">✓</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Support your claim with at least TWO pieces of accurate and relevant information.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of evidence must be from one of the foundational documents listed above.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second piece of evidence must be from any other foundational document not used as your first piece</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of evidence or it may be from your knowledge of course concepts.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">✓</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Use reasoning to explain why your evidence supports your claim or thesis.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr class=\"row\">\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col1\">✓</td>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"entry colname:col2\">Respond to an opposing or alternate perspective using rebuttal or refutation.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n","o":null,"a":null,"f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_84dbbd918365d2049bc327b38deabee2","c":"<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"passage\">\n<div class=\"prose style:1\">\n<p class=\"passage_para\">Equality of opportunity is a core value in the American political system.

The constitutional Presidency—as events so apparently disparate as the Indochina War and the Watergate affair showed, has become the imperial Presidency and threatens to be the revolutionary Presidency. . . . The imperial Presidency was essentially the creation of foreign policy. A combination of doctrines and emotions—belief in the permanent and universal crisis, fear of communism, faith in the duty and right of the United States to intervene swiftly in every part of the world—had brought about the unprecedented centralization of decisions. Prolonged war in Vietnam strengthened the tendencies toward both centralization and exclusion. So the imperial Presidency grew at the expense of the constitutional order.

In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a policy under the Clean Water Act that regulated water on private property. This policy, called the “Waters of the United States,” defined which bodies of water were subject to the protections of the Clean Water Act, including wetlands, ponds on private property, and streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The EPA made this change as it argued that the connection between these waters and larger bodies of water, like lakes, rivers, and larger streams, meant that pollution in these smaller waters needed to be regulated.

The report indicates that the shortage is especially severe in subjects such as math, science, and special education, where finding qualified teachers to fill positions can be hampered by low starting salaries.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The report finds that the average salary for a teacher is $60,000, but for a new teacher it is usually less than $40,000. Furthermore, salaries adjusted for inflation have declined 4.5% in the past decade. The report also indicates that the teacher shortage is considerably worse in high-poverty areas.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">NEA President Lily Eskelsen García has called for higher salaries to address the issue. “How can we recruit and retain quality teachers for our students if we don’t pay them what they’re worth? It is time to show respect to those professionals who dedicate their lives to students and building the future of our communities. Professional work deserves professional pay.”</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB US Government & Politics"]},"cat":{"t":[],"f":{}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR598946":{"id":"VR598946","q":{"id":"VR598946","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p class=\"direction_paragraph\" xmlns=\"http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/apip/apipv1p0/qtiitem/imsqti_v2p2\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">Respond to all parts of the question.

As a result, Republicans in the state initiated a recall election of the governor by gathering over one million signatures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Recall is an electoral process by which citizens can vote to remove elected officials before the end of their term. There are provisions for recall elections of state officials in 19 states. In California, citizens initiate a recall election by collecting a minimum number of signatures on a petition, which puts the issue on a ballot in a subsequent election. If a majority of the voters choose to recall the elected official, then that official is removed from office. In California, the recall ballot asks voters two separate questions: Should the governor be recalled? And if so, who should be the new governor?</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">The front-running candidate to replace Governor Davis was action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy on a popular late-night television program, and his celebrity status drew national media attention. During his appearance, he said of Davis, “He’s failing [Californians] terribly, and this is why he needs to be recalled.” With the understanding that California had more registered Democrats than Republicans, Schwarzenegger strategically focused his campaign on his own personal story as a self-made immigrant and distanced himself from national Republican leaders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In the final vote, Californians voted to recall Governor Davis, and Schwarzenegger was elected as his replacement. Exit polls showed that most voters who favored recalling Davis cited his recent performance as the basis for their vote.</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB US Government & Politics"]},"cat":{"t":[398845,399058,399059,399062,399063,399112,399113,399114,398846,398870,398874,398876,399121,399125,399127,398816,398817,398822,398821],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Secondary Source"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["Scenario Concept Application"],"Question Set":["No"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR734079":{"id":"VR734079","q":{"id":"VR734079","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">Use the data to answer the following questions.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"ordered_list style:4\">\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Identify the generation that is projected to have the lowest percentage of eligible voters in 2028, as shown in the bar graph.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Describe the trend over time in the data, as shown in the bar graph.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Draw a conclusion about how a trend in the data could affect a 2032 presidential candidate’s strategy to mobilize eligible voters.</li>\n\t<li class=\"list_paragraph\">Explain how life cycle effects, as shown in the bar graph, could influence a candidate’s policy platform.</li>\n</ol>\n","o":null,"a":null,"f":[{"t":"sharedpassage","id":"_98eed9b50b9ca89e4dc00e92660bf0f0","c":"<div>\n<div class=\"stimulus_reference\">\n<div class=\"standalone_image\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<p class=\"title_line passage-title\">PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS BY GENERATION, 2016-2036</p>\n</div>\n<img alt=\"The figure shows a segmented bar graph titled “Percent of Eligible Voters by Generation, 2016 through 2036.” The vertical axis is labeled “Eligible Voters,” and the percentages 0 through 100, in increments of 20 percent, are indicated.

Parents who showed financial need could obtain vouchers of up to $2,500 a year for tuition at participating private schools. Both religious and nonreligious private schools could participate in the program, and in the first year, 96&nbsp;percent of voucher recipients opted to attend religious schools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">A group of Ohio taxpayers, which included Doris Simmons-Harris, filed a lawsuit against the public school system, claiming the use of public funds for religious institutions was unconstitutional. The local federal district court ruled in favor of Simmons-Harris. After the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the ruling, Sarah Zelman, the Superintendent of Public Instruction in Ohio, appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">In a 5–4 vote on the subsequent case of <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Zelman</span> v. <span class=\"formatted_text font_style:italic\">Simmons-Harris</span> (2002), the Supreme Court held that the public funding of a school voucher program that includes religious schools was constitutionally permitted. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist reasoned that the program “. . . provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district. It permits such individuals . . . genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious.</p>\n"}],"tg":["created_by:CB_AP","Subject:QB US Government & Politics"]},"cat":{"t":[398845,398966,398974,398975,398976,398846,398884,398885,398886,399121,399125,399127,398816,398823,398824,398826,398817,398822,398828,398832,398830,398829,398831],"f":{"Exam Alignment":["High"],"Stimulus Type":["Secondary Source"],"Security":["Publicly Available"],"Question Type":["SCOTUS Case"],"Question Set":["No"]}},"r":null,"rubricId":null,"hasCategory":true,"hasRubric":false},"VR734081":{"id":"VR734081","q":{"id":"VR734081","t":"longtextV2","s":"<p class=\"stem_paragraph\">An important feature of a democratic republic is that it represents the will of the people.
