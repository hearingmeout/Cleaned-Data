A pump is used to remove water from the pool until the pool is empty. When the pump is running, the rate at which the volume of water in the pool decreases is constant. During the first two hours, the pump works slower than usual due to a broken piece. Then the pump stops working. The broken piece is replaced, and the pump works at its usual rate until the pool is completely emptied of water. The entire process of emptying the pool takes six hours.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}],"choicesHtml":["<div class=\"qti-align-center inline_image\"><img alt=\"Graph of a piecewise linear function with 3 line segments in Quadrant one of the x y plane with the origin labeled O.
